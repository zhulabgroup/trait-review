	abstract = {Background and Aims: Effects of elevated CO2 (E) within a generation on photosynthesis and stomatal features have been well documented in crops; however, long-Term responses to gradually elevated CO2 (Eg) and abruptly elevated CO2 (Ea) over multiple generations remain scarce. Methods: Japonica rice plants grown in open-Top chambers were tested in the first generation (F1) under Ea and in the fifth generation (F5) under Eg and Ea, as follows: Ea in F1: Ambient CO2 (A) + 200 μmol mol-1; Eg in F5: An increase of A + 40 μmol mol-1 year-1 until A + 200 μmol mol-1 from 2016 to 2020; Ea in F5: A + 200 μmol mol-1 from 2016 to 2020. For multigenerational tests, the harvested seeds were grown continuously in the following year in the respective CO2 environments. Key Results: The responses to Ea in F1 were consistent with the previous consensus, such as the occurrence of photosynthetic acclimation, stimulation of photosynthesis, and downregulation of photosynthetic physiological parameters and stomatal area. In contrast, multigenerational exposure to both Eg and Ea did not induce photosynthetic acclimation, but stimulated greater photosynthesis and had little effect on the photosynthetic physiology and stomatal traits. This suggests that E retained intergenerational effects on photosynthesis and stomatal features and that there were no multigenerational differences in the effects of Eg and Ea. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that projecting future changes induced by E based on the physiological responses of contemporary plants could be misleading. Thus, responses of plants to large and rapid environmental changes within a generation cannot predict the long-Term response of plants to natural environmental changes over multiple generations, especially in annual herbs with short life cycles.  © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is an important regulator of body growth, development, and metabolism. The poly(dA:dT) tract affects the accessibility of transcription factor binding sites to regulate transcription. Therefore, this study assessed the effects of two poly(dA:dT) tracts on the transcriptional activity of porcine IGF1. The luciferase assay results demonstrated that the poly(dA:dT) tract 2 (−264/−255) was a positive regulatory element for IGF1 gene expression, and the activities between the different lengths of the poly(dA:dT) tract 2 were significant ((Formula presented.)). The transcription factor C/EBPα inhibited the transcription of IGF1 by binding to tract 2, and the expression levels between the lengths of tract 2 after C/EBPα binding were also statistically different ((Formula presented.)). Only the alleles 10T and 11T were found in the tract 2 in commercial pig breeds, while the 9T, 10T, and 11T alleles were found in Chinese native pig breeds. The allele frequencies were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in all pig breeds. The genotypes of tract 2 were significantly associated with the growth traits (days to 115 kg and average daily gain) ((Formula presented.)) in commercial pig breeds. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that the tract 2 mutation could be applied as a candidate genetic marker for growth trait selection in pig breeding programs. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Climate change is an important driver of range shifts and community composition changes. Still, little is known about how the responses are influenced by the combination of land use, species interactions and species traits. We integrate climate and distributional data for 131 butterfly species in Sweden and Finland and show that cumulative species richness has increased with increasing temperature over the past 120 years. Average provincial species richness increased by 64% (range 15–229%), from 46 to 70. The rate and direction of range expansions have not matched the temperature changes, in part because colonisations have been modified by other climatic variables, land use and vary according to species characteristics representing ecological generalisation and species interactions. Results emphasise the role of a broad ecological filtering, whereby a mismatch between environmental conditions and species preferences limit the ability to disperse and establish populations in emerging climates and novel areas, with potentially widespread implications for ecosystem functioning. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) pathogen and one of the leading etiologies in multiple nosocomial infections. Treatment of P. aeruginosa is becoming increasingly difficult due to its ever-increasing antibiotic resistance trends. This study investigated clinical multidrug resistance (MDR) P. aeruginosa (MDR-PA), their intrinsic resistance determinants, including the presence of chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase (Ampicillinase), decreased expression of outer membrane porin protein OprD and selected acquired β-lactamase resistance genes. Methods: Out of 238 clinical specimens, including urines from urinary tract-infected patients, wound swabs, burn swabs, and catheter aspirates, were collected from two major hospitals in Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Samples were inoculated with Cetrimide agar to isolate presumptive P. aeruginosa. Bacteria were identified by cultural, biochemical characterization, 16S rDNA sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Virulence-associated genes of P. aeruginosa, namely, toxA, lasB, and plcH, were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were investigated against ten antibiotics belonging to seven groups by disc-diffusion method followed by a selected minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay. Phenotypic expression of Metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) production was checked by the double disc synergistic test selectively among the imipenem-resistant isolates. Acquisition of β-lactam resistance trait was examined by PCR detection of bla-genes variants. Mutational loss of the OprD was analyzed by PCR to investigate intrinsic resistance determinants. Phenotypic overexpression of chromosomal AmpC was assayed with the identification of the AmpC gene by PCR. The expression level of OprD was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: Fifty-three P. aeruginosa was identified, with an overall isolation of 22.3% (53/238), where urine remains the most prevalent source. Virulence genes toxA, lasB, and plcH were identified in the isolates of 92.4%, 96.2%, and 94.3%. The highest phenotypic antimicrobial resistance was observed against ampicillin and ceftriaxone (100%), followed by cefotaxime (96%), tetracycline (89%), azithromycin (72%), imipenem (31%), ciprofloxacin (29%), levofloxacin (29%), gentamycin (27%) and ceftazidime (14%). The antibiogram pattern revealed 85% of isolates as multidrug-resistant, while 12% were considered extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-P. aeruginosa. The carriage of β-lactamase genes blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaOXA was detected in 4%, 2%, and 2% cephalosporin-resistant isolates, respectively. Double disc synergistic test revealed 87% of imipenem-resistant isolates expressing MBL-mediated resistance phenomenon. All seven ceftazidime-resistant isolates showed the presence of the AmpC gene with phenotypic overproduction of the AmpC enzyme, indicating AmpC-mediated ceftazidime resistance. Mutational loss of OprD was observed in 12% of phenotypically multidrug-resistant isolates, and RT-qPCR analysis revealed reduced expression of OprD porin protein at various levels in the outer membrane of multidrug-resistant isolates. Conclusions: This study depicts the high prevalence of MDR-PA in clinical specimens in Bangladesh. The identified intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance determinants play synergistic roles in emerging MDR-PA. © 2023, Ibn Sina Trust. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the recent trend of global warming, HS-instigated diminishing could extremely jeopardize animal health, productivity, and farm profit. Marjoram essential oil (MEOE) is a worthy source of wide range phytogenic compounds that may improve heat tolerance, redox and inflammatory homeostasis, and immunity of newly weaned rabbits, specifically if included in the diets in a nano form. One hundred newly weaned rabbits were randomly distributed into four homogeneous groups. The first group (control group) included rabbits that received basal diet without supplementation. In contrast, the other three groups included rabbits that received basal diets supplemented with 200 (MEONE200), 400 (MEONE400), and 800 (MEONE800) mg MEONE/kg diet, respectively. Among MEONE-treated groups and control groups, MEONE400 group showed the highest (p < 0.001) growth performance traits, including final body weight, average daily gain, feed efficiency, and the performance index. Compared to the control, all MEONE-supplemented groups possessed lower rectal temperatures and respiration rates, recording the lowest values in the MEONE400 group. The oxidative stress biomarkers and immunoglobulins G and M were significantly improved in the MEONE400 and MEONE800 compared with the control and MEONE200 groups. The addition of MEONE (400 or 800 mg/kg) decreased the concentrations of serum interleukin-4 (p = 0.0003), interferon gamma (p = 0.0004), and tumor necrosis factor-α (p < 0.0001) but significantly elevated (p < 0.001) the activity of nitric oxide, amyloid A and lysozyme. Liver functions (lower concentrations of liver enzymes) were significantly improved in all MEONE-treated groups compared to the control group. There was a considerable significant effect of dietary supplementation of MEONE400 on economic efficiency. In conclusion, the addition of 400 mg/kg to the diets of newly weaned rabbits can be recommended as an affective intervention to mitigate the negative impacts of HS. © 2023 by the authors.},

Aim: Evaluation of the laboratory antimicrobial actions and chelating activities, and the field influence of Eichhornia crassipes on performance, biochemical and immunoglobulin concentrations, and intestinal microbiota in overwhelmed broiler chickens. Methods: We assessed the laboratory antimicrobial actions of E. crassipes 1% suspension against bacterial (Escherichia coli O157: H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium) and fungal (Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans) microorganisms using a 96-well minimal inhibitory concentration, and the chelating activities of E. crassipes against calcium sulfate and copper sulfate. Also, we designed randomly four equal groups out of 200 1–day-old Ross® 308 chicks on a deep litter system. Three groups (G1, G2, and G3) were supplied daily with E. crassipes suspension of 1% from the third day until the end of the experiment, while the fourth group (G4) received non-treated tap water. Broilers of G1–3 were challenged with calcium sulfate (75 mg.l−1), copper sulfate (200 mg.l−1), and S. Typhimurium (1.5 × 106 CFU.ml−1) polluted water respectively on the 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, 35th days of age. We collected 1,914 samples by the end of the study, these samples included 90 E. crassipes pollutants and 480 E. crassipes microbial mixes, 192 sera, 192 intestinal swabs, and 960 tissues. Results: Eichhornia crassipes treated water reveals highly significant (p < 0.01) improvements in water quality assessments and a highly significant (p < 0.01) increase in dissolved oxygen levels compared to tap water. Eichhornia crassipes 1% achieved a 100% adsorption capability for calcium and copper sulfate after 1-hour and 100% bactericidal (E. coli O157: H7 and S. Typhimurium) and fungicidal (A. niger and C. albicans) actions after 1, 2, 2, and 2-hours, respectively. Broilers treated with 1% E. crassipes revealed highly significant (p < 0.01) improvements in performance indices, carcasses characteristics, biochemical and immunological parameters, and highly significant (p < 0.01) decreases of cortisol hormone and bacteriological parameters in all treated broiler groups compared to the control. Conclusion: Eichhornia crassipes 1% reveals a significant improvement in drinking water quality, as well as produces high adsorptive and antimicrobial actions. Eichhornia crassipes 1% improved performance traits, carcass quality, and intestinal microbiota in overwhelmed broilers. © 2023, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

In trial 1, CON and BMR were planted on two different dates. In trial 2, CON and BMR, mixed or not with CWP, were harvested when PM was at the boot or heading stages. In trial 1, dry matter (DM) yield was similar between both PM genotypes but delaying establishment reduced DM yield by 30%. Additionally, BMR had a lower concentration of acid detergent lignin (ADL) and a higher in vitro neutral detergent fiber digestibility (IVNDFD) compared to CON. In Trial 2, the DM yield was 7.3% higher for CON compared to BMR, and PM with the BMR trait had a lower level of ADL and higher IVNDFD compared to CON. Mixing PM with CWP had negligible effects on nutritional composition but reduced DM yield by 8.3%. Results of these studies indicated that fiber from BMR PM is more digestible than CON but, in one of the trials, this occurred at the expense of lower DM yield. Mixing CWP with PM negatively impacted DM yield. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many annual grasses exhibit drought-avoiding life cycles in which rapid reproduction must be completed before soil water is exhausted. This strategy would seem to require a hydraulic system capable of sustaining reproduction at all costs to the rest of the plant, yet little is known about the whole-plant structure of hydraulic vulnerability in grasses. METHODS: We examine vulnerability to water-stress-induced xylem cavitation in roots, flag leaves, and basal and apical regions of peduncles of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. 'Krichauff') to understand the staged failure of xylem function in severe drought. The functionality of segmented vulnerabilities is tested by conducting rehydration experiments after acute dehydration. KEY RESULTS: We show that water supply to peduncles is more drought resistant than in leaves due to greater xylem cavitation resistance, ensuring a pathway of water can be maintained from the roots to the reproductive tissues even after severe water deficit. Differential rehydration of peduncles compared to leaves following drought confirmed the functionality of xylem supply from roots to seed after water stress sufficient to completely cavitate flag leaf vessels. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a proportion of the hydraulic pathway between roots and seeds remains functional under extreme dehydration, suggesting that vulnerability traits in this key grass species reflect its reproductive strategy. © The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {Background: A typical cancerous growth in the urinary tract, bladder cancer (BLCA) has a dismal survival rate and a poor chance of being cured. The cytoskeleton has been shown to be tightly related to tumor invasion and metastasis. Nevertheless, the expression of genes associated with the cytoskeleton and their prognostic significance in BLCA remain unknown. Methods: In our study, we performed differential expression analysis of cytoskeleton-related genes between BLCA versus normal bladder tissues. According to the outcomes of this analysis of differentially expressed genes, all BLCA cases doing nonnegative matrix decomposition clustering analysis be classified into different molecular subtypes and were subjected to Immune cell infiltration analysis. We then constructed a cytoskeleton-associated gene prediction model for BLCA, and performed risk score independent prognostic analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to evaluate and validate the prognostic value of the model. Furthermore, enrichment analysis, clinical correlation analysis of prognostic models, and immune cell correlation analysis were carried out. Results: We identified 546 differentially expressed genes that are linked to the cytoskeleton, including 314 up-regulated genes and 232 down-regulated genes. All BLCA cases doing nonnegative matrix decomposition clustering analysis could be classified into 2 molecular subtypes, and we observed differences (P < .05) in C1 and C2 immune scores about 9 cell types. Next, we obtained 129 significantly expressed cytoskeleton-related genes. A final optimized model was constructed consisting of 11 cytoskeleton-related genes. Survival curves and risk assessment predicted the prognostic risk in both groups of patients with BLCA. Survival curves and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate and validate the prognostic value of the model. Significant enrichment pathways for cytoskeleton-associated genes in bladder cancer samples were explored by Gene set enrichment analysis enrichment analysis. After we obtained the risk scores, a clinical correlation analysis was performed to examine which clinical traits were related to the risk scores. Finally, we demonstrated a correlation between different immune cells. Conclusion: Cytoskeleton-related genes have an important predictive value for BLCA, and the prognostic model we constructed may enable personalized treatment of BLCA.  © 2020 American Heart Association, Inc.},

Since its invasion of Africa, the Far East, and Australia where Bt crops are largely absent, insecticide use has increased and reduced susceptibility to several insecticides used for decades in its native distribution area have been reported. Poor efficacy at field-level is sometimes incorrectly ascribed to pest resistance, while numerous other factors influence efficacy at field-level. In this paper, we review the history of insecticide resistance in S. frugiperda and discuss the influence that life history traits, migration ecology, and chemical control practices may have on control efficacy and resistance evolution. The indirect role that poor national policies have on pesticide use practices, and indirectly on control efficacy and selection pressure is discussed. Evidence shows that local selection for resistance drives resistance evolution. Integrated pest management, rather than reliance on a single tactic, is the best way to suppress S. frugiperda numbers and the over-use of insecticides which selects for resistance.  © 2022 The Author(s).

The change in metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to increased aerobic glycolysis is termed as the “Warburg Effect” after the Nobel Laureate who first conceived the correspondence between transformed cellular metabolism and cancer. The chapter is structured around the key roles various oncogenes and tumor suppressors play in metabolic dysregulation promoting tumor initiation, invasion, and progression. The Warburg Effect or aerobic glycolysis is of great significance due to its ability to function even under hypoxic conditions. Hence, the transformed metabolism is a characteristic feature of all cancer cells and a stepwise study of these pathways can be fruitful in the treatment of this disease. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, R.C.

	abstract = {The aim of this work was to study the ecotoxicological effects of an endocrine disruptor triclosan on the clam Ruditapes decussatus. The bivalves were exposed to three concentrations of this biocide (C1 = 100 ng/L, C2 = 200 ng/L and C3 = 500 ng/L) for three and seven days. The impact was assessed at the gills and digestive glands, through activities of an antioxidant defense biomarker (Gluthatione S-Transferase, GST), a damage biomarker (Malondialdehyde, MDA), and a neurotoxicity biomarker (Acetylcholinesterase, AChE). Furthermore, histological traits were approached in different organs to evaluate any possible alteration induced by triclosan. It appears from this study that both gills and digestive glands responded discernibly to triclosan and effects were concentration-dependent. The stressed clams showed a significant increase in their GST and MDA activities in gills and digestive glands compared to controls for both time slots considered. In turn, the AChE activity was clearly inhibited in both organs in a time dependent way. The histological study made it possible to observe several structural pathologies caused by triclosan in the gills and the digestive gland. These alterations consisted mainly of inflammatory reactions, malformations of the lamellae and fusion of the gill filaments, degeneration of the connective tissue, and the erosion of the gill cilia with the appearance of certain severe alterations (cell necrosis and apoptosis), which can thus cause a malfunction of the gills and eventually lead to a reduction in oxygen consumption and a disruption of the osmoregulation for bivalves. Alterations in the digestive gland have also been detected, mainly by epithelial alterations, thinning of the tubules, and alteration of the basal cell membrane which can impair the ability of clams to absorb food. At germinal cells, several damages were observed in the oocytes which probably disturbed the reproductive function and the fertility of the clams. The damages observed in female gonads were caused by the cytolysis of a large number of oocytes through autophagy and necrosis at 200 ng triclosan/L. Moreover, at 500 ng triclosan/L, hemocytic infiltration was observed in acini and apoptotic bodies reflected in the fragmentation of more than 90% of oocytes. © 2023 by the authors.},

Maintaining population genetic diversity is essential for the survival of species facing rapid environmental change, and variation loss will further ecological and evolutionary change. We used trait values of spring foliar leaf-out phenology of 400 genotypes from three geographically isolated populations of Populus angustifolia grown under common conditions, in concert with stacked species distribution modeling, to ask: (a) How will climate change alter phenological variation across the P. angustifolia species-range, and within populations; and (b) will the distribution of phenological variation among and within populations converge (become more similar) in future climatic conditions? Models predicted a net loss of phenological variation in future climate scenarios on 20-25% of the landscape across the species’ range, with the trailing edge population losing variation on as much as 47% of the landscape. Our models also predicted that population’s phenological trait distributions will become more similar over time. This stacked distribution model approach allows for the identification of areas expected to experience the greatest loss of genetically based functional trait variation and areas that may be priorities to conserve as future genetic climate refugia. © 2022, The Author(s).},

The research involved 41 Teramana goats and 40 Saanen goats. The milk of each group was collected and used to produce cheese, which was analysed fresh and after 30 and 60 days of ripening. Cheese samples were subjected to evaluations of the physical parameters, including colour and the TPA test, in addition to chemical evaluations that were focused on the determination of total lipids, fatty acids composition, volatile profile and proteolysis. The results showed the Teramana goat to be rich in fat, characterised by a significant increase in conjugates of linoleic acid (CLA), which are attributed to important health benefits. The analysis of volatile compounds showed more oxidative stability of Teramana goats’ cheeses during the ripening. The results from sensory analyses indicated an improved hardness and yellowness, which could be accompanied by an improvement in customer acceptance. In conclusion, our study shows interesting results regarding the milk and cheese from the Teramana goat, as well as a positive evaluation by consumers, findings that encourage the importance of promoting native breeds. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Barley, oats, or spelt consumed as minimally processed whole grains provide several health benefits, especially when grown under organic field management conditions. Therefore, the effects of organic and conventional farming on the compositional traits (protein, fibre, fat, and ash) of barley, oat, and spelt grains and groats were compared using three winter barley varieties (‘Anemone’, ‘BC Favorit’, and ‘Sandra’), two spring oat varieties (‘Max’ and ‘Noni’), and three spelt varieties (‘Ebners Rotkorn’, ‘Murska bela’, and ‘Ostro’). Groats were produced from harvested grains by a combination of threshing, winnowing, and brushing/polishing. Multitrait analysis showed significant differences between species, field management practices, and fractions, with clear compositional differences between organic and conventional spelt. Barley and oat groats had a higher thousand kernel weight (TKW) and β-glucan, but lower crude fibre, fat, and ash contents than the grains. The composition of the grains of the different species differed significantly for more traits (TKW, fibre, fat, ash, and β-glucan) than that of the groats (TKW and fat), while field management only affected the fibre content of the groats and the TKW, ash, and β-glucan contents of the grains. The TKW, protein, and fat contents of the different species differed significantly under both conventional and organic growing conditions, while the TKW and fibre contents of grains and groats differed under both systems. The caloric value of the final products of barley, oats, and spelt groats ranged from 334–358 kcal/100 g.

The basic success of spelt wheat in organic farming might be explained by the fact that spelt wheat belongs to the group of hulled wheat where the presence of a husk protects the seed from abiotic and biotic stress factors, thus demanding less chemical protection. The goal of this study was to investigate the variations in the bioactive compound (alkylresorcinol, arabinoxylan, β-glucan), protein, starch and fructan content of bread and spelt wheat under different farming systems (conventional and organic). The results showed higher protein and alkylresorcinol but lower fructan content in spelt wheat. Organic spelt had significantly higher starch, fiber and alkylresorcinol content but lower β-glucan and protein content than conventionally grown spelt. The spelt variety ‘Oberkulmer-Rotkorn’ was characterized by the highest values for the majority of analyzed traits under both farming systems. Overall, the environmental conditions (Hungary and Serbia), farming systems (conventional and organic) and wheat species (bread and spelt) contributed to the variations of the compositional traits in different manners. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {We aimed at exploring the plant functional traits whose responses to drought or salinity are altered by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). We performed a meta-analysis across 114 articles spanning 110 plant species or cultivars. We quantified the size effect of AM symbiosis on the stress response of several functional traits, using linear mixed model analysis (LMM). Correlation analysis between functional traits and total biomass responses to stresses were also performed through LMM. The literature search and further selection yielded seven functional traits, extracted from 114 laboratory studies, including 888 observations and 110 plant species/cultivars. Evidence for significant effects of predictor variables (type of stress, AM symbiosis and/or their interaction) on functional trait response were found for leaf area ratio (LAR), root mass fraction (RMF) and root-shoot (R:S) ratio. Our results provided evidence to accept the hypothesis that AM fungal inoculation may reduce the stress response of these plant functional traits by decreasing its magnitude. We also found a weak correlation between stress responses of these traits and total biomass variation. Although our literature search and data collection were intensive and our results robust, the scope of our conclusions is limited by the agronomical bias of plant species targeted by the meta-analysis. Further knowledge on non-cultivable plant species and better understanding of the mechanisms ruling resources allocation in plants would allow more generalised conclusions.},

	abstract = {The anomaly P is a mass morphological anomaly found in some populations of anuran amphibians (water frogs of the genus Pelophylax and toads of the genera Bufo and Bufotes) caused by the parasitic flatworm Strigea robusta. Minimum dose of cercariae for the appearance of the anomaly P remains unknown. However, it is important information for understanding of host population dynamics after invasion and the effects of the parasite on the second intermediate hosts. Herein, the invasion properties of S. robusta in Pelophylax lessonae tadpoles (Anura: Ranidae) and minimum dose for appearance of mild and severe forms of the anomaly P syndrome were described after direct experiments with certain numbers of cercariae exposure. Experimental groups of tadpoles have been exposed to eight doses of cercariae (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16). A total of 63.8% tadpoles survived to the end of this experiment. It was revealed that a mild form of the anomaly P (polydactyly) can appear after infection by two cercariae, while the severe form traits appear after infection by four cercariae. The mean number of detected encysted metacercariae was reached to 53.5%. Differences in infection rates can be explained by the presence of an individual immune response in tadpoles or by the presence of different genetic lineages of the parasite infecting the same snail, which have different infectious potential. Low doses of infection leading to the induction of anomalies characterize S. robusta as a highly pathogenic species for amphibian species that are susceptible to infection and show an abnormal phenotype. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Salmonella is among the most frequently isolated foodborne pathogens, and biofilm formed by Salmonella poses a potential threat to food safety. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially propionate and butyrate, have been demonstrated to exhibit a beneficial effect on promoting intestinal health and regulating the host immune system, but their anti-biofilm property has not been well studied. This study aims to investigate the effects of propionate or butyrate on the biofilm formation and certain virulence traits of Salmonella. We investigated the effect of propionate or butyrate on the biofilm formation of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) SL1344 grown in LB broth or food models (milk or chicken juice) by crystal violet staining methods. Biofilm formation was significantly reduced in LB broth and food models and the reduction was visualized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Biofilm metabolic activity was attenuated in the presence of propionate or butyrate. Meanwhile, both SCFAs decreased AI-2 quorum sensing based on reporter strain assay. Butyrate, not propionate, could effectively reduce bacterial motility. Bacterial adhesion to and invasion of Caco-2 cells were also significantly inhibited in the presence of both SCFAs. Finally, two SCFAs downregulated virulence genes related to biofilm formation and invasion through real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These findings demonstrate the potential application of SCFAs in the mitigation of Salmonella biofilm in food systems, but future research mimicking food environments encountered during the food chain is necessitated. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Tropical corals construct the three-dimensional framework for one of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, providing habitat to a plethora of species across taxa. However, these ecosystem engineers are facing unprecedented challenges, such as increasing disease prevalence and marine heatwaves associated with anthropogenic global change. As a result, major declines in coral cover and health are being observed across the world's oceans, often due to the breakdown of coral-associated symbioses. Here, we review the interactions between the major symbiotic partners of the coral holobiont - the cnidarian host, algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae, and the microbiome - that influence trait variation, including the molecular mechanisms that underlie symbiosis and the resulting physiological benefits of different microbial partnerships. In doing so, we highlight the current framework for the formation and maintenance of cnidarian-Symbiodiniaceae symbiosis, and the role that immunity pathways play in this relationship. We emphasize that understanding these complex interactions is challenging when you consider the vast genetic variation of the cnidarian host and algal symbiont, as well as their highly diverse microbiome, which is also an important player in coral holobiont health. Given the complex interactions between and among symbiotic partners, we propose several research directions and approaches focused on symbiosis model systems and emerging technologies that will broaden our understanding of how these partner interactions may facilitate the prediction of coral holobiont phenotype, especially under rapid environmental change.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

To explore multi-day rhythms in healthy human behavior our analysis includes over 300 million smartphone touchscreen interactions logging up to 2 years of day-to-day activities (N401 subjects). At the level of each individual, we find a complex expression of multi-day rhythms where the rhythms occur scattered across diverse smartphone behaviors. With non-negative matrix factorization, we extract the scattered rhythms to reveal periods ranging from 7 to 52 days – cutting across age and gender. The rhythms are likely free-running – instead of being ubiquitously driven by the moon – as they did not show broad population-level synchronization even though the sampled population lived in northern Europe. We propose that multi-day rhythms are a common trait, but their consequences are uniquely experienced in day-to-day behavior. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Agriculture is an essential sector for the increasing world population, hence the need for more food production. However, the aim of increasing food crop production is mostly suppressed by abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity. Salinity is a major limiting factor that inhibits the potential of plant growth and productivity worldwide. Hence, understanding the mechanisms behind plant stress response is important for developing new biomarker approaches that will increase salt tolerance in crops. To survive, plants exhibit various morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes when faced with saline conditions. This study was carried out to explore and evaluate the morphological and physiological effects of salinity on maize grown in the absence/presence of NaCl, followed by measurement of the various growth parameters at the end of a treatment cycle. Results of the study revealed that salt stress significantly decreased growth parameters such as plant height, leaf number, leaf width, leaf area, leaf length, and shoot (weight and length). On the other hand, salinity decreased physiological traits such as stomatal count, stomatal density, transpiration, and respiration rates. This study has shown the negative effects of salt stress on the morphology and physiology of maize. These findings can be used as a reference tool in stress response studies focusing on salt stress pathways in maize and other related crops. © 2022, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

Despite the importance of forests, insect trends therein have received little attention. Using 10 years of standardized data (120,996 individuals; 1,805 species) from 140 sites in Germany, we show that declines occurred in most sites and species across trophic groups. In particular, declines (quantified as the correlation between year and the respective community response) were more consistent in sites with many non-native trees or a large amount of timber harvested before the onset of sampling. Correlations at the species level depended on species’ life-history. Larger species, more abundant species, and species of higher trophic level declined most, while herbivores increased. This suggests potential shifts in food webs possibly affecting ecosystem functioning. A targeted management, including promoting more natural tree species composition and partially reduced harvesting, can contribute to mitigating declines. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Mosquitoes have been shown to readily consume microplastics and they have a significant impact on health in society, yet we have limited knowledge on the effects of MP exposure on fitness-related traits. Additionally, the data we do have come primarily from studies that have used unrealistically high microplastic concentrations, or unrealistic methods of exposure. Here we exposed wild-type first instar Culex pipiens and Culex tarsalis larvae to two 4.8-5.8 μm polystyrene microplastic concentrations (0 particles/ml, 200 particles/ml, 20,000 particles/ml) to evaluate the effect of MP exposure on body size, development, and growth rate. We found no effect of microplastics on any of the traits in either species. These results indicate microplastic exposures comparable to levels found in nature have minimal effects on these fitness-related traits. Future directions for this work include examining whether the effects of MP exposure are exacerbated when evaluated in combination with other common stressors, such as warming temperatures, pesticides, and food limitation. © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith), is a significant invasive pest identified as a serious threat to global agricultural production and food security. However, its ovipositional preference, larval feeding selectivity, and nutritional indices are less studied. Here, we investigated these traits of FAW when fed on maize, wheat, soybean, tomato, cotton, and Chinese cabbage, and analyzed the correlation between its nutritional indices and the nutritional contents of crops. The results showed that the highest number of eggs were laid on maize and the lowest number were laid on tomato. The highest feeding choice rate of third instar larvae was on maize, and the lowest was on Chinese cabbage. The fifth instar larvae showed the highest feeding choice rate on maize, but no significant differences were found among other crop species. The food consumption (FC), the relative growth rate (RGR), and the approximate digestibility (AD) were significantly higher on maize and wheat, while the efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and the efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) were significantly higher when fed on cotton and Chinese cabbage. The FC, the relative consumption rate (RCR), RGR, and AD were significantly and positively correlated with soluble sugar and protein contents of host plants, while the ECI and ECD were significantly and negatively correlated with the soluble sugar content. The present study indicates that FAW may cause potential economic losses to these crops besides maize, and these findings are valuable in managing and controlling this pest. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: The oriental eyeworm Thelazia callipaeda (Spirurida: Thelaziidae) is an emerging parasitic ocular nematode of carnivores and humans. In domestic animals and humans, the infection causes varying degrees of inflammation and lacrimation, and wild carnivores represent an important reservoir. In this study we examined the infection status and molecular characterization of T. callipaeda in two urban carnivores, raccoons Procyon lotor and wild Japanese raccoon dogs Nyctereutes viverrinus, in the Kanto region of Japan. Methods: From January 2020 to December 2021, 193 carcasses including 178 raccoons and 15 raccoon dogs were examined for the presence of worms in the eye. The worms from infected animals (one worm per host) were morphologically identified as T. callipaeda. Worms (1–5 worms per host) were subjected to genetic analysis using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences. Results: The prevalence of T. callipaeda in raccoons and Japanese raccoon dogs was 20.2% (36/178) and 13.3% (2/15), respectively. The cox1 sequences from 56 worms from 38 animals revealed three haplotypes (h9, h10, and h12). Analysis of multiple worms for five raccoons showed co-infection of two different haplotypes (h9 and h10) in a single host. Comparing our data with published sequences, three sequences obtained from raccoons and raccoon dogs shared the same haplotypes as those reported in humans, dogs, and cats in Japan. Conclusions: Our findings show a high prevalence of T. callipaeda in raccoons, suggesting that this invasive carnivore species serves as an important natural reservoir of T. callipaeda in the Kanto region of Japan, an area with the highest human population of the country.

	abstract = {Heat stress has severe impacts on rabbit performance because they have difficulty getting rid of excess heat. The interaction between genetic and environmental factors plays a vital role in the adaptation process. The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of interaction between the genotype and heat conditions (G×H) on litter size and growth traits. Two rabbit lines were used in the current study, Egyptian maternal line (APRI) and New Zealand White (NZW). The rabbits were raised under normal (22°C) or heat stress (35°C) conditions. The does were raised in individual cages, and their kits were reared under the same conditions. Negative effects of heat conditions were noted for litter traits, as heat stress had significantly reduced the number of born alive, total born, and marketed number rabbits by about 16, 11, and 25%, respectively. Moreover, growth traits were reduced under heat stress conditions compared to normal temperature conditions. Significant differences between genotypes were observed, APRI rabbits were higher than NWZ rabbits in the total born, number of born alive, number weaned, and the number of marketed rabbits by 10, 8, 11, and 10%, respectively. Genotype by heat conditions interaction effects were observed, APRI litters under normal conditions showed significantly higher litter traits than NWZ litters, whereas relevant reductions in litter traits of APRI line than NZW litters when reared in heat conditions. For growth traits, the differences between the two lines under normal conditions were reduced when animals of the two lines were raised under heat stress, for BW28, BW42, BW63, ADG28−42, and DF28−42 while these differences were increased for ADG42−63, DF28−42 and feed conversion during the whole fattening period. Based on the observed G × H interactions, it is important to select the animals under the same production conditions to raise rabbits that can cope with the expected global warming conditions.

A. albopictus has a complex life history with aquatic egg, larval and pupal stages, and a terrestrial adult stage. This requires targeted management strategies for each life stage, coordinated across time and space. Population genetics can aid in A. albopictus control by evaluating patterns of genetic diversity and dispersal. However, how life stage impacts population genetic characteristics is unknown. We examined whether patterns of A. albopictus genetic diversity and differentiation changed with life stage at a spatial scale relevant to management efforts. We first conducted a literature review of field-caught A. albopictus population genetic papers and identified 101 peer-reviewed publications, none of which compared results between life stages. Our study uniquely examines population genomic patterns of egg and adult A. albopictus at five sites in Wake County, North Carolina, USA, using 8425 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that the level of genetic diversity and connectivity between sites varied between adults and eggs. This warrants further study and is critical for research aimed at informing local management. © 2022 Royal Entomological Society.},

The aim of this study was to describe the morphological characteristics of raccoons from parts of eastern and western Japan during their early invasion stages, focusing on the relationships between body length and the principal component of craniometrics, with region, sex, age class, body length, and body mass index using a regression model. The body length increased more in males than females and in the older age class, supporting the association with intrasexual selection and competition for food resources. Positive relationships for body length and body mass index were found in craniometric analyses, particularly regarding cranial size components, in addition to age class for both sexes, while cranial size also differed between regions for females. The relationship between body length and craniometrics was inconsistent with that of subspecies originating in North America. Given the sympatric distribution of haplotypes of multiple subspecies without reproductive-isolating barriers in North America and in several introduced areas, hybridization must have occurred prior to the introduction or naturalization of this species. © 2022 by the authors.},

The genetic variation in BM and its components was studied in 10 varieties of alfalfa under irrigation (I) and drought (D) in a greenhouse. A randomized complete block experimental design was used, with four repetitions in I and four in D. The experimental unit was an individual plant in a PVC pipe. Sowing was carried out on March 15, 2017, and transplanting in the pipes, 20 days after sowing. The fertilization dose 60-140-00 was applied at 44, 240 and 420 dat (days after transplanting). D reduced (P≤0.01) BM, leaf dry matter yield (LDMY), number of stems (NS) and radiation use efficiency (RUE). The plants in D did not recover their productive capacity after experiencing the water deficit, even after the recovery irrigation. D also decreased (P≤0.01) the phenotypic variance for BM and its components; the additive variance was greater (P≤0.01) than the dominance variance for all traits in I and D. The BM, L:S ratio, plant height (PH), NS and RUE had higher (P≤0.01) heritability in I and D. The Genex, Atlixco, Júpiter and Milenia varieties were the most productive (P≤0.01) in D and could be used for forage production in water-scarce areas or as parental lines for forage yield improvement in selection programs. © 2023 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

	abstract = {Background: Milk fat is one of the main reference elements for evaluating milk quality and is a primary objective trait in dairy cattle breeding. In recent years, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been found to play crucial roles in many biological processes. However, the function and expression profiles of circRNAs in milk fat synthesis in cows are not completely understood. We performed RNA sequencing to analyze the genome-wide expression of circRNA transcripts in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs) from cows with extreme differences in milk fat percentage. We identified candidate differential circRNAs associated with milk fat metabolism using functional enrichment analysis and constructed a lipid metabolism-related competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interactive regulatory network. Results: A total of 290 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed (DE-circRNAs) in high milk fat percentage (HMF) cows compared to that in low milk fat percentage (LMF) cows. Of the 290 circRNAs, 142 were significantly upregulated and 148 were significantly downregulated. Enrichment analysis (Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) identified four DE-circRNAs (circ_0001122, circ_0007367, circ_0018269, and circ_0015179) that potentially regulate milk fat metabolism. Among them, circ_0001122, circ_0007367, and circ_0015179 had relatively high expression levels in cow mammary gland tissue compared to other tissues (heart, liver, kidney, uterus, ovaries, and small intestine) of cows. The regulatory networks circ_0001122:miR-12043:LIPG, circ_0007367:miR-331-3p:CIDEA/PML, and circ_0018269:miR-11989:RORC/HPX are potential networks to explore the mechanism of milk fat regulation. Conclusions: These results reveal the possible role of circRNAs in milk fat metabolism in dairy cows. Several important circRNAs and ceRNAs affecting milk fat synthesis were identified, providing insights into the complex biology of milk fat synthesis as well as a novel theoretical perspective for future research on lactation, milk quality, and breed improvement in dairy cows.

Goats have provided meat and milk as high-quality protein sources, and are an integral part of rural livelihoods and an insurance against future emergencies. Nearly 19.22 million heads of goats are distributed throughout the Islands of Indonesia, most of which belong to indigenous breeds, which possess phenotypic and genetic diversities that are indispansable for their conservation and genetic improvement programs. Despite their con-siderable diversities, not all the indigenous goats are fully characterized and harnessed. Unfortunately, some are classified as at risk of extinction. Since small-scale farmers with traditional production systems dominate in the country, goat productivity is relatively low. However, the indigenous goats are still important genetic resources due to their adaptive traits that are relevant to climate change and low maintenance.

	abstract = {China’s East Asia monsoon zone is undergoing rapid land-use conversion and urbanization. Safeguarding remaining biodiversity requires reducing, mitigating, and/or eliminating the negative impacts of human-induced landscape modification. In this study, we sampled ground-dwelling ants at 40 plots over 12 continuous months in a suburban area in southwestern China to examine whether and how vegetation composition and habitat fragmentation affected species richness and assemblage composition for the general ant community and, specifically, for principal functional groups (including Opportunists and Generalized Myrmicinae). Warmer seasons were associated with a higher capture rate for all functional groups. Patterns of ant species richness among Opportunists were more sensitive to vegetation and fragmentation than for Generalized Myrmicinae, and these effects generally varied with season. Patterns of ant assemblage composition for Opportunists were exclusively sensitive to vegetation, whereas Generalized Myrmicinae were sensitive to both vegetation and fragmentation with variation among seasons. Overall, our findings highlight the important role of seasonality, vegetation composition, and habitat fragmentation in mediating the impacts of human-induced landscape modification on urbanized ant communities, which make an essential functional contribution to biodiversity in the East Asia monsoon zone. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Sample preparation is playing an increasingly important role in sample analysis. The enrichment efficiency of the target and the removal effect of the sample matrix are strongly dependent on the extraction material. Therefore, the development of efficient extraction materials is an important research focus in the field of sample preparation. Various advanced materials such as nanomaterials, mesoporous materials, ionic liquids, aerogels, carbon materials, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks have been introduced to produce a diverse range of extraction materials for sample preparation. Owing to its unique physical and chemical properties, graphene, an excellent carbon nanomaterial, has attracted significant attention in different areas. Due to their unique advantages of large surface area, large π-electrons, excellent adsorption properties, abundant functional groups, and facile chemical modification, graphene-based materials have displayed excellent extraction performance for diverse analytes. Furthermore, graphene-based extraction materials have been applied to pretreat real samples from different fields. This paper provides an overview of the recent advances in graphene sample preparation from 2020 to date. The manuscript covers the use of graphene, graphene oxide, and the related functionalized materials as sorbents, as well as their specific applications in cartridge solid-phase extraction, dispersive solid-phase extraction, magnetic solid-phase extraction, stir bar sorptive extraction, fiber solid-phase microextraction, and in-tube solid-phase microextraction. To prevent the aggregation of graphene, three-dimensional graphene, porous graphene aerogels, graphene-modified silica, and stainless-steel mesh were developed for cartridge solid-phase extraction. Furthermore, some graphene-based extraction materials were used to develop online solid-phase extraction, which allowed for automatic and high-throughput tests. Graphene nanosheets and their hybrid materials with molybdenum disulfide or zinc oxide nanoparticles have been applied to dispersive solid-phase extraction, and several types of contaminants, including metal ions, bisphenol endocrine disruptors, paraben preservatives, and phthalates, could be captured. By combination with magnetic materials using the coprecipitation method or via chemical post-modification, many magnetic graphene extraction materials have been produced for magnetic solid-phase extraction. The introduction of magnetic graphene not only enhanced the extraction efficiency but also simplified the test process, making it highly suitable for complex samples such as food and biological samples. Similar to magnetic solid-phase extraction, stir bar sorptive extraction is a very simple and efficient extraction method that shows good extraction performance for metal ions and organic pollutants from environmental water, medicines in urine, and organic pollutants in cosmetics. In addition to its excellent applicability to solid-phase extraction, graphene delivered satisfactory performance for solid-phase microextraction. Graphene has been used as an extraction coating for the extraction of fibers or tubes by coupling solid-phase microextraction with chromatographic detection, and many kinds of organic pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls, phthalates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, toluene, xylenes, organophosphorus pesticides, phenoxy acid herbicides, and antibiotics, in environmental or biological samples have been successfully determined. The extraction mechanism, including π-π, electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrophilic, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, is also discussed. Because of the mixed-mode interactions and rich functionalization, graphene-based extraction materials could effectively capture and selectively enrich different types of species. These extraction or microextraction techniques have been coupled with detection methods such as chromatography, mass spectrometry, and atomic absorption spectroscopy and widely used in environmental monitoring, food safety, and biochemical analysis. The future development of graphene in the field of sample pretreatment focuses on the following aspects: 1) functionalization of graphene with specific groups such as affinity groups, chelating groups, and molecularly imprinted sites to achieve unique extraction selectivity; 2) combination of graphene with the advanced materials, including covalent organic frameworks, metal organic frameworks, aerogels, and nanomaterials, thus realizing the complementary advantages between materials, so that the hybrid graphene materials find broad application prospects in sample preparation; 3) combination of electromagnetic materials with graphene to form electromagnetic composites, as well as the use of electromagnetic fields to improve extraction selectivity and efficiency; 4) exploiting the good performance of graphene-based materials to overcome the difficulty encountered in the pretreatment of complex samples; 5) development of more green methods to prepare graphene-based extraction materials or functionalize graphene, in line with the trends in green chemistry; 6) application of more graphene-based materials to online sample preparation for meeting the development trends in the field of analytical chemistry. © 2022, Chinese Journal of Chromatography (Se Pu).

	abstract = {Parasites are integral members of the global biodiversity. They are useful indicators of environmental stress, food web structure and diversity. Ectoparasites have the potential to transmit vector-borne diseases of public health and veterinary importance and to play an important role in the regulation and evolution of host populations. The interlinkages between hosts, parasites and the environment are complex and challenging to study, leading to controversial results. Most previous studies have been focused on one or two parasite groups, while hosts are often co-infected by different taxa. The present study aims to assess the influence of environmental and host traits on the entire ectoparasite community composition of the rodent Akodon azarae. A total of 278 rodents were examined and mites (Mesostigmata), lice (Phthiraptera), ticks (Ixodida) and fleas (Siphonaptera) were determined. A multi-correspondence analysis was performed in order to analyze interactions within the ectoparasite community and the influence of environmental and host variables on this assembly. We found that environmental variables have a stronger influence on the composition of the ectoparasite community of A. azarae than the host variables analyzed. Minimum temperature was the most influential variable among the studied. In addition, we found evidence of agonistic and antagonistic interactions between ticks and mites, lice and fleas. The present study supports the hypothesis that minimum temperature plays a major role in the dynamics that shape the ectoparasite community of A. azarae, probably through both direct and indirect processes. This finding becomes particularly relevant in a climate change scenario. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Photoelectric catalytic water splitting for hydrogen production is considered a promising method for hydrogen production, which can convert clean and renewable solar energy into sustainable and pollution-free hydrogen energy. An in-depth understanding of the relationship between the properties and functions of photocatalytic materials can help design and prepare efficient photodegradable water systems. Among them, α-Fe2O3 has a suitable band gap, can absorb visible light below 600 nm, and has the advantages of abundant raw materials high stabil-ity, and has become one of the most promising photoelectrode materials. However, as a photoe-lectrode material, α-Fe2O3 has the shortcomings of short photogenerated hole diffusion distance, low oxidation kinetics, poor conductivity, ease to be corroding, and so on, resulting in a very low photoelectric conversion efficiency, which limits its application in the field of photoelectric ca-talysis. This paper reviews the research progress of α-Fe2O3 as a photoanode. Firstly, the principle of photoelectric catalytic water splitting for hydrogen production and the main preparation methods of α-Fe2O3 photoanode is described; Secondly, the research work on modification of α-Fe2O3 photoanode by morphology control, element doping, construction of the heterojunction, surface modification and thermal excitation assisted effect in recent years is introduced. The photochemical performance of α-Fe2O3 photoanode is enhanced by improving the photocurrent density and the transfer of photo-generated carriers. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Recently, returning straw to the fields has been proved as a direct and effective method to tackle soil nutrient loss and agricultural pollution. Meanwhile, the slow decomposition of straw may harm the growth of the next crop. This study aimed to determine the effects of rumen microorganisms (RMs) on straw decomposition, bacterial microbial community structure, soil properties, and soil enzyme activity. The results showed that RMs significantly enhanced the degradation rate of straw in the soil, reaching 39.52%, which was 41.37% higher than that of the control on the 30th day after straw return. After 30 d, straw degradation showed a significant slower trend in both the control and the experimental groups. According to the soil physicochemical parameters, the application of rumen fluid expedited soil matter transformation and nutrient buildup, and increased the urease, sucrase, and cellulase activity by 10%–20%. The qualitative analysis of straw showed that the hydroxyl functional group structure of cellulose in straw was greatly damaged after the application of rumen fluid. The analysis of soil microbial community structure revealed that the addition of rumen fluid led to the proliferation of Actinobacteria with strong cellulose degradation ability, which was the main reason for the accelerated straw decomposition. Our study highlights that returning rice straw to the fields with rumen fluid inoculation can be used as an effective measure to enhance the biological value of recycled rice straw, proposing a viable solution to the problem of sluggish straw decomposition. © 2023, Zhejiang University Press.},

	abstract = {Background/purpose: Emerging evidence has shown that various failures in cancer therapy, such as drug resistance, metastasis, and cancer relapse are attributed to cancer stem cells (CSCs). Also, growing attention has been paid to the regulation of non-coding RNAs in cancer stemness. Here, we aimed to investigate the contribution of LINC01296 in the modulation of oral CSCs. Materials and methods: The phenotypic assays including migration, invasion, and colony-forming abilities were carried out in CSCs of two types of oral cancer cells (SAS and GNM) following the knockdown of LINC01296. In addition, the percentage of cells expressing stemness marker, ALDH1, and drug resistance marker, ABCG2, was examined as well as the self-renewal capacity after silencing of LINC01296. Moreover, a luciferase reporter was used to validate the direct interaction between LINC01296 and miR-143. Results: Our results showed that LINC01296 was significantly overexpressed in oral cancer tissues and positively correlated with stemness markers. The phenotypic and flow cytometry assays demonstrated that suppression of LINC01296 reduced the aggressiveness, cancer stemness features, and colony-forming and self-renewal abilities in oral CSCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that LINC01296 may enhance cancer stemness features through suppression of the effect of miR-143. Conclusion: Silencing of LINC01296 may be a promising direction for oral cancer therapy by reducing cancer stemness via regulation of miR-143. © 2023 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: At the population level, genetic diversity is a key determinant of a tree species' capacity to cope with stress. However, little is known about the relative importance of the different components of genetic diversity for tree stress responses. We compared how two sources of genetic diversity, genotype and cytotype (i.e. differences in ploidy levels), influence growth, phytochemical and physiological traits of Populus tremuloides in the presence and absence of environmental stress. Methods: In a series of field studies, we first assessed variation in traits across diploid and triploid aspen genotypes from Utah and Wisconsin under non-stressed conditions. In two follow-up experiments, we exposed diploid and triploid aspen genotypes from Wisconsin to individual and interactive drought stress and defoliation treatments and quantified trait variations under stress. Key Results: We found that (1) tree growth and associated traits did not differ significantly between ploidy levels under non-stressed conditions. Instead, variation in tree growth and most other traits was driven by genotypic and population differences. (2) Genotypic differences were critical for explaining variation of most functional traits and their responses to stress. (3) Ploidy level played a subtle role in shaping traits and trait stress responses, as its influence was typically obscured by genotypic differences. (4) As an exception to the third conclusion, we showed that triploid trees expressed 17 % higher foliar defence (tremulacin) levels, 11 % higher photosynthesis levels and 23 % higher rubisco activity under well-watered conditions. Moreover, triploid trees displayed greater drought resilience than diploids as they produced 35 % more new tissue than diploids when recovering from drought stress. Conclusion: Although ploidy level can strongly influence the ecology of tree species, those effects may be relatively small in contrast to the effects of genotypic variation in highly diverse species.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Three diets were tested: control (n = 90) received a conventional feed, whereas the two experimental groups (n = 90 each) received the control feed supplemented with the red grape polyphenol extract (GPE) at the concentration of 100 (GPE 100) or 200 mg/kg (GPE 200). The two GPE diets lowered (p < 0.05) the red (a *) and yellow (b *) indexes, fillet hardness, and total lipid content. Chewiness, concentration of saturated fatty acids, and the Atherogenic Index were higher (p < 0.05) in the control group; GPE diets increased (p < 0.05) the polyunsaturated fatty acids content. Furthermore, the concentration of malondialdehyde was lower (p < 0.05) in fillets of the GPE groups, thus confirming the antioxidant effect of the red grape extract and its effectiveness in preventing lipid oxidation. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Sixty male Awassi lambs were used to investigate the effects of dietary Yucca schidgera extract (YS) on the production, fecal and urinary odor emissions, and carcass traits of growing lambs fed complete pellets. Lambs were fed either a complete pelleted diet without yucca (control) or supplemented with 300 or 600 mg YS/kg dry matter (DM) during the 84-day experiment. The weights and feed consumption of the lambs were measured weekly. Blood samples were taken on days 1, 28, 58, and 84, and ruminal fluid samples were collected on day 70. On day 90, the odor emissions from feces and urine were measured. On day 84, 12 lambs were slaughtered for the evaluation of carcass and meat quality. The final values for bodyweight, bodyweight gain, and feed efficiency of lambs fed the YS300 diet were 3.40%, 6.64%, and 6.17%, respectively, higher (p < 0.05) than those fed the YS600 diet. Additionally, the percentage of dressing, myofibril fragmentation index, and ruminal isovalerate percentage of lambs treated with YS600 were higher than those treated with YS300. Compared with the control, the addition of yucca reduced odor emissions from feces and urine. In conclusion, dietary YS300 had no additional benefits on growth rate, feed efficiency, and carcass traits, while dietary YS600 improved fecal and urinary odors. © 2023 by the authors.},

The identification and characterization of this local resource is essential for its conservation and improvement. For this reason, in the present study it was carried out the analysis of the diversity and genetic relationships of the Mixteco Creole cattle population of Oaxaca, using 19 microsatellite DNA markers and 32 reference cattle populations belonging to the BIOBOVIS consortium of the CONBIAND Network. The mean number of alleles detected was 8.8 ± 2.1 and the estimated effective number of alleles was 4.5 ± 1.2. The genetic diversity represented by the expected (0.7700 ± 0.0682) and observed (0.7170 ± 0.0998) heterozygosity values was within the range of estimators obtained in previous studies with local cattle populations using microsatellite markers. An analysis of the population structure revealed a predominant influence of Iberian germplasm (Bos taurus). There is also a close relationship between the Mixteco Creole and the rest of the Mexican Creole cattle populations, with the exception of the Tropical Dairy Creole. © 2023 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

	abstract = {There were 463,000 head of beef cows in New Mexico as of January 1, 2021 (NASS, 2020), down roughly 4% from 2020 (NASS, 2019). Frequent drought often results in herd reduction and loss of valuable genetic progress. Bull selection is critical due to their influence on herd development. A survey was conducted to identify traits important to bull selection in New Mexico. Surveys were collected digitally (n = 83) and via the mail (n = 74). Responses were largely by cow/calf producers averaging 57 ± 1 years old with 24 ± 1 years' experience. Survey respondents represented 4,384,296 acres of private owned, private leased, and leased public rangeland and irrigated pasture meadow in New Mexico and surrounding states. Average cow/calf operation size was 294 ± 39 head and average bull herd size was 21 ± 3 head. Average price paid for a bull in the past 2 years was $3,981 ± 213. Physical characteristics, individual bull performance information, and genetic information are all important traits to New Mexico bull buyers; however, most producers (56%) indicated that structural soundness was the most important factor influencing their selection decisions. Amongst expected progeny differences (EPDs), New Mexico producers consider the calving ease direct (CED) and birth weight (BW) EPDS to be most important (40% and 35%, respectively). Producers also indicated that multitrait selection indexes used by the American Angus Association were important to their selection decisions, with the beef value ($B) and weaned calf value ($W) indexes being cited most often (35% and 31%, respectively). Elements important to bull purchase include the bull's sale preview (87%), body condition score (86%), feed efficiency/average daily gain information (85%), and actual scrotal circumference (82%). Following purchase of a new bull, most (60%) keep the bull separate from the cow herd until the following breeding season, while the remaining 40% of producers turn newly purchased bulls out within 30 days of purchase. Sixty eight percent of producers evaluate semen quality annually or prior to the start of the breeding season. Interestingly, 39% of producers indicated they used reproductive technologies like artificial insemination and synchronization of estrus while most (80%) test for trichomoniasis. The primary factor influencing culling decisions is age, followed by soundness and fertility. © 2022 The Author(s).

These temperature-trait relationships are typically measured under laboratory conditions that ignore how conspecific competition in depleting resource environments—a commonly occurring scenario in nature—regulates natural populations. Here, we used laboratory experiments on the mosquito Aedes aegypti, combined with a stage-structured population model, to investigate this issue. We find that intensified larval competition in ecologically-realistic depleting resource environments can significantly diminish the vector’s maximal population-level fitness across the entire temperature range, cause a ~6 °C decrease in the optimal temperature for fitness, and contract its thermal niche width by ~10 °C. Our results provide evidence for the importance of considering intra-specific competition under depleting resources when predicting how arthropod populations will respond to climatic warming. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Mosquitoes in the genus Culex are primary vectors in the US for West Nile virus (WNV) and other arboviruses. Climatic drivers such as temperature have differential effects on species-specific changes in mosquito range, distribution, and abundance, posing challenges for population modeling, disease forecasting, and subsequent public health decisions. Understanding these differences in underlying biological dynamics is crucial in the face of climate change. Methods: We collected empirical data on thermal response for immature development rate, egg viability, oviposition, survival to adulthood, and adult lifespan for Culex pipiens, Cx. quinquefasciatus, Cx. tarsalis, and Cx. restuans from existing literature according to the PRISMA scoping review guidelines. Results: We observed linear relationships with temperature for development rate and lifespan, and nonlinear relationships for survival and egg viability, with underlying variation between species. Optimal ranges and critical minima and maxima also appeared varied. To illustrate how model output can change with experimental input data from individual Culex species, we applied a modified equation for temperature-dependent mosquito type reproduction number for endemic spread of WNV among mosquitoes and observed different effects. Conclusions: Current models often input theoretical parameters estimated from a single vector species; we show the need to implement the real-world heterogeneity in thermal response between species and present a useful data resource for researchers working toward that goal.

	abstract = {Phlebotomus tobbi is a widely distributed sand fly species in Turkey and is the proven vector of Leishmania infantum and several Phleboviruses. Information regarding the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity is crucial for managing vector-borne diseases, as the changing environmental conditions have consequences for the survival of arthropods and the disease agents they transmit. However, limited data is available on the impacts of environmental conditions on the traits associated with sand fly survival, reproduction, and vectorial competence. The present study aimed to reveal the changes in the expression levels of three selected P. tobbi genes using laboratory-reared and wild-caught populations. A nervous system protein, Cacophony (PtCac), related to the life history traits of sand flies, and two sand fly salivary protein genes, PtSP32 and PtSP38, influence the infection of the vertebrate hosts, were assessed. Sand flies were maintained at 23 °C and 27 °C in the laboratory to evaluate the relationship between temperature and the expressed phenotypes. Field collections were carried out in three climatically distinct regions of Turkey to establish the regional differences in the gene expression levels of natural P. tobbi populations. In the laboratory, PtCac expression increased with the temperature. However, PtCac expression was negatively correlated with local temperature and humidity conditions. No differences were detected in the PtSP32 gene expression levels of both laboratory-reared and wild-caught females, but a negative correlation was observed with relative humidity in natural populations. Although the expression levels of PtSP38 did not differ among the females collected from distinct regions, a positive correlation was detected in the laboratory-reared colony. The findings indicated that changes in environmental conditions could drive the expression levels of P. tobbi genes, which influence population dynamics and the transmission risk of the disease. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Dok-do, a small, remote volcanic island in the East Sea of Korea in the western Pacific, has recently been invaded by rats, posing ecological problems. To infer their origin and invasion pathway, we collected rats from Dok-do and from the potential introduction source locations, Ulleung-do in the Pacific Ocean, and four east coastal ports. First, we identified that the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) was the only rat species occurring at collecting sites based on the key morphological characteristics. To determine the population-level genetic diversity pattern, we applied the 3-RADseq approach. After a series of filtrations (minor allele frequency < 0.05, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium p < 1 × 10−7), 4042 SNPs were retained for the final dataset from the 25,439 SNPs initially isolated. The spatial structure and genetic diversity pattern of brown rats suggested that the rat population on Dok-do was likely introduced from Ulleung-do. Our work provides practical information that will assist in the management of invasive brown rats in vulnerable island ecosystems. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Bacteria in planktonic and biofilm forms exhibit different phenotypic properties. In this study, the phenotypic traits and probiotic functions of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Y42 in planktonic and biofilm forms were assessed. After 36 h of static culture, scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the L. plantarum Y42 bacterial cells contained interconnected adhesive matter on the surface, forming a ~18 μm layer of dense biofilms. The surface properties of L. plantarum Y42 in biofilm form, including autoaggregation ability, hydrophobicity, acid-base charge, and adhesiveness, were all higher than those in the planktonic form. Biofilm L. plantarum Y42 showed a higher tolerance to adverse environmental conditions and a higher survival rate, enzymatic activity, and integrity after vacuum lyophilization. And biofilm L. plantarum Y42 had higher adhesion to human enterocyte HT-29 cell monolayers, inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory factors IL-6 and TNF-α, and promoted the expressions of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 and barrier proteins Claudin-1 and Occludin. In addition, L. plantarum Y42 in biofilm form can inhibit the adhesion and invasion of Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 to HT-29 cell monolayers and is more effective in relieving the inflammatory reactions and injuries of HT-29 cells caused by L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115. In conclusion, L. plantarum Y42 in biofilm form exhibited better probiotic functions compared to that in planktonic form. This indicated that L. plantarum Y42 can form biofilms to enhance its probiotic functions, which provided a theoretical basis for better development and utilization of L. plantarum Y42. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Barki sheep industry is becoming increasingly important in Egypt because of the high quality of their meat and wool. This sheep breed is also commonly known for its resistance to arid and harsh environmental conditions. Such characteristics can be exploited in solving the problematic situation of inadequate animal protein for human consumption, particularly under climatic changes. However, very few studies have investigated aspects of breeding, nutrition, and susceptibility to infectious or non-infectious diseases in Barki sheep. Herein, we propose to unravel the differences in the clinical and biochemical profiles among Barki sheep of different growth rates. We measured clinical and biochemical parameters in stunted (n = 10; test group) and in good body condition (n = 9; control group) Barki sheep. Animals subjected to this experiment were of the same sex (female), age (12 months old), and housed in the same farm with similar conditions of feeding, management practice, and vaccination and deworming regimens. Regarding clinical examination, stunted/tested sheep showed a significantly higher pulse and respiratory rate compared to sheep with a good body condition/control group. The appetite, body temperature, and digestion processes were the same in both groups. In biochemical investigations, nutritional biomarkers were reduced markedly in stunted sheep compared with the control sheep, including total protein (p = 0.0445), albumin (p = 0.0087), cholesterol (p = 0.0007), and triglycerides (p = 0.0059). In addition, the Barki sheep test group suffered from higher levels of urea and blood urea nitrogen than the control group. Consistently, growth and thyroid hormone levels were lower in stunted sheep than the control sheep, although the differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). No significant differences were detected in both groups for serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, and zinc (p > 0.05). To detect the reasons for emaciation, certain debilitating infections were tested. All tested sheep showed negative coprological tests for gastrointestinal parasites, and had no obvious seropositivity to brucellosis, toxoplasmosis, neosporosis, or Q fever. This study demonstrates the useful biochemical markers for monitoring growth performance in Egyptian Barki sheep and unravels the usefulness of this breed in nationwide breeding and farming. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The most likely pathway for many species to survive future climate change is by pre-existing trait variation providing a fitness advantage under the new climate. Here we evaluate the potential role of haemoglobin (Hb) variation in bank voles under future climate change. We model gene-climate relationships for two functionally distinct Hb types, HbS and HbF, which have a north-south distribution in Britain presenting an unusually tractable system linking genetic variation in physiology to geographical and temporal variation in climate. Projections to future climatic conditions suggest a change in relative climatic suitability that would result in HbS being displaced by HbF in northern Britain. This would facilitate local adaptation to future climate—without Hb displacement, populations in northern Britain would likely be suboptimally adapted because their Hb would not match local climatic conditions. Our study shows how pre-existing physiological differences can influence the adaptive capacity of species to climate change. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Patterns of growth throughout the lifetime of an animal reflect critical life history traits such as reproductive timing, physiology, and ecological interactions. The ancestral growth pattern for tetrapods has traditionally been described as slow-to-moderately paced, akin to modern amphibians, with fast growth and high metabolic rates considered a specialized physiological trait of amniotes. Here, we present bone histology from an ontogenetic series of the Early Carboniferous stem tetrapod Whatcheeria deltae, and document evidence of fibrolamellar bone—primary bone tissue associated with fast growth. Our data indicate that Whatcheeria juveniles grew rapidly and reached skeletal maturity quickly, allowing them to occupy a large-bodied predator niche in their paleoenvironment. This life history strategy contrasts with those described for other stem tetrapods and indicates that a diversity of growth patterns existed at the origins of tetrapod diversification. Importantly, Whatcheeria marks an unexpectedly early occurrence of fibrolamellar bone in Tetrapoda, both temporally and phylogenetically. These findings reveal that elevated juvenile growth is not limited to amniotes, but has a deep history in the tetrapod clade and may have played a previously unrecognized role in the tetrapod invasion of land. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Pentoxifylline is a derivative of methylxanthine that affects sperm motility. Also, zinc is an antioxidant that is involved in the activation of antioxidant enzymes. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of co-administration of pentoxifylline, and zinc in men with idiopathic infertility. In the present study, men with idiopathic infertility were identified and randomly divided into four groups: pentoxifylline, zinc, pentoxifylline + zinc, and placebo. According to the grouping, the patients received pentoxifylline and zinc for 3 months. Then, sperm parameters, biochemical factors, reproductive hormones, inflammatory factors, and DNA damage were evaluated before and after intervention. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software. Pentoxifylline and zinc were significantly effective in improving biochemical parameters, inflammatory factors, concentration, and motility of sperm. Pentoxifylline did not affect sperm morphology and reproductive hormones. However, in the zinc and zinc + pentoxifylline groups, a significant increase in normal morphology and reproductive hormones was observed. In the pentoxifylline group, sperm DNA fragmentation increased significantly, while in the zinc and zinc + pentoxifylline group, DNA fragmentation reduced significantly. Because of the role of zinc in protecting sperm chromatin, it is recommended that zinc and pentoxifyllinebe prescribed simultaneously.

	abstract = {The prolactin (PRL) gene has previously been reported as a potential candidate for egg production in birds. This study identified the prolactin gene polymorphism in the exon 5 region and its association with reproductive traits of TB crossbred ducks. Three hundred and thirty-one crossbred ducks were used in this study, with blood samples collected from the wing vein for DNA extraction to amplify the fragment length with 536 bp by PCR, and then the PCR products were cleaved with the PstI enzyme. The fragment length with 536 bp was successfully amplified in all individual samples, while genetic polymorphism at the PRL/PstI site was identified as C and T alleles, with allele frequencies 0.811 (C) and 0.189 (T). Three genotypes were observed with frequencies 0.647, 0.329 and 0.024 for CC, CT and TT, respectively. The PIC (polymorphic information content) and He (expected heterozygosity) were 0.260 and 0.306. The group of ducks with CC/PstI genotype laid the first egg significant earlier (P<0.05) than CT/PstI or TT/PstI genotype ducks (145.3 vs 152.3 days or 153.2 days, respectively), the total of egg number up to 38 weeks of age was higher (P<0.05) in the group of ducks with CC/PstI genotype compared to CT/PstI or TT/PstI genotype (99.3 vs 93.1 or 91.7 eggs). The average egg weight did not significant difference among genotypes (72.3, 72.2 and 70.6g; P>0.05). From these results, the polymorphic site at PRL/PstI was identified, ducks bearing CC genotype possess earlier age at first egg and egg yield up to 38 wks of age and considered as a candidate gene for supporting genetic selection in ducks to improve egg production. © 2023 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Stomatal regulation allows plants to promptly respond to water stress. However, our understanding of the impact of above and belowground hydraulic traits on stomatal regulation remains incomplete. The objective of this study was to investigate how key plant hydraulic traits impact transpiration of maize during soil drying. We hypothesize that the stomatal response to soil drying is related to a loss in soil hydraulic conductivity at the root-soil interface, which in turn depends on plant hydraulic traits. Methods: We investigate the response of 48 contrasting maize (Zea mays) genotypes to soil drying, utilizing a novel phenotyping facility. In this context, we measure the relationship between leaf water potential, soil water potential, soil water content and transpiration, as well as root, rhizosphere and aboveground plant traits. Key Results: Genotypes differed in their responsiveness to soil drying. The critical soil water potential at which plants started decreasing transpiration was related to a combination of above and belowground traits: genotypes with a higher maximum transpiration and plant hydraulic conductance as well as a smaller root and rhizosphere system closed stomata at less negative soil water potentials. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the importance of belowground hydraulics for stomatal regulation and hence drought responsiveness during soil drying. Furthermore, this finding supports the hypothesis that stomata start to close when soil hydraulic conductivity drops at the root-soil interface.  © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a rare subset of tumor cells, have been recognized as promotive role on tumor initiation and propagation. Among, aerobic glycolysis, widely clarified in multiple tumor cells, is the key for maintaining cancer stemness. Regrettably, it is largely unknown about the connection of cellular metabolic reprogramming and stemness in gastric carcinoma (GC). Two GC parental cells lines PAMC-82 and SNU-16 and their spheroids were obtained to determine the expression status of POU1F1 using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis, respectively. Gain or loss-of-function assay was employed to assess its biological effects. Sphere formation and transwell assays were performed to evaluate the stem cell-like traits, including self-renewal capacity, migration and invasion. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase reporter assays were conducted for determining the binding relationship of POU1F1 on ENO1 promoter region. Herein, aberrantly upregulated POU1F1 was observed in spheroids, compared with the parental PAMC-82 and SNU-16 cells, which promoted stem cell-like traits, as representing increasing sphere formation, enhanced cell migration and invasion. Additionally, POU1F1 expression was positively with glycolytic signaling, as displaying increasing glucose consumption, lactic acid production, and extracellular acid ratio (ECAR). Furthermore, POU1F1 was identified to be a transcriptional activator of ENO1, of which overexpression remarkably abolished POU1F1 knockdown-mediated blocking effects. Taken together, we draw a conclusion that POU1F1 facilitated the stem cell-like properties of GC cells through transcriptionally augmenting ENO1 to enhance glycolysis. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Medicinal plants, like others, are affected by biotic as well as abiotic stress. The latter category includes a variety of stressors such as drought, flooding, salinity, temperature extremes (hot as well as cold), UV radiations, gaseous pollutants, heavy metals and metalloids, nutrient deficiency, and pesticides, among others. Low doses of these stresses stimulate metabolic activities in plants but higher doses negatively affect the overall plant performance by limiting the genetic potential, growth, photosynthesis, metabolic capacity and yield. These stresses also produce free radicals, such as superoxide and peroxide ions, which is a source of injury to the various plant systems. Almost all abiotic stresses damage the photosynthetic device at various levels of its organization such as chloroplast ultrastructure, and the pigments, lipids and protein composition. Production and relative distribution of photosynthate influence the growth and development, morpho-anatomical traits, and secondary metabolites (SMs) biosynthesis in the affected plants. Variation in the quality and concentration of SMs means a lot in medicinal plants, because the therapeutic efficacy of these plants is in fact dependent on these metabolites. However, most of the plants defy the adverse effect of the stressors by means of adequate defense mechanisms and tolerance potential through integrated cellular and molecular reactions. This chapter reviews the overall impact of abiotic stresses on growth features, developmental processes, cytological and physiological parameters, and SMs production in medicinal plants. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

	abstract = {Disease risk is a persistent problem in domestic cattle farming, while economic traits are the main concern. This study aimed to reveal the epigenetic basis for differences between zebu (Bos indicus) and taurine cattle (Bos taurus) in disease, disease resistance, and economic traits, and provide a theoretical basis for the genetic improvement of domestic cattle. In this study, whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was used to analyze the whole-genome methylation of spleen and liver samples from Yunnan zebu and Holstein cattle. In the genome-wide methylation pattern analysis, it was found that the methylation pattern of all samples was dominated by the CG type, which accounted for >94.9%. The DNA methylation levels of different functional regions and transcriptional elements in the CG background varied widely. However, the methylation levels of different samples in the same functional regions or transcriptional elements did not differ significantly. In addition, we identified a large number of differentially methylation region (DMR) in both the spleen and liver groups, of which 4713 and 4663 were annotated to functional elements, and most of them were annotated to the intronic and exonic regions of genes. GO and KEGG functional analysis of the same differentially methylation region (DMG) in the spleen and liver groups revealed that significantly enriched pathways were involved in neurological, disease, and growth functions. As a result of the results of DMR localization, we screened six genes (DNM3, INPP4B, PLD, PCYT1B, KCNN2, and SLIT3) that were tissue-specific candidates for economic traits, disease, and disease resistance in Yunnan zebu. In this study, DNA methylation was used to construct links between genotypes and phenotypes in domestic cattle, providing useful information for further screening of epigenetic molecular markers in zebu and taurine cattle. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The main task of selective breeding is to determine the early productivity of offspring. The sooner the economic value of an animal is determined, the more profitable the result will be, due to the proper estimation of high and low productive calves and distribution of the resources among them, accordingly. To predict productivity, we offer to use a systematic assessment of animals by using the main genetic parameters (correlation coefficients, heritability, and regression) based on data such as the measurement of morphological characteristics of animals, obtained using the automated non-contact body measurement system based on RGB-D image capture. The usefulness of the image capture system lies in significant time reduction that is spent on data collection and improvement in data collection accuracy due to the absence of subjective measurement errors. We used the RGB-D image capture system to measure the live weight of mother cows, as well as the live weight and body size of their calves (height at the withers, height in the sacrum, oblique length of the trunk, chest depth, chest girth, pastern girth). Cows and cattle of black-and-white and Holstein breeds (n = 561) were selected as the object of the study. Correlation analysis revealed the main indices for the forecast of meat productivity—live weight and measurements of animals at birth. Calculation of the selection effect is necessary for planning breeding work, since it can determine the value of economically beneficial traits in subsequent generations, which is very important for increasing the profitability of livestock production. This approach can be used in livestock farms for predicting the meat productivity of black-and-white cattle. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Livestock is an essential life commodity in modern agriculture involving breeding and maintenance. The farming practices have evolved mainly over the last century for commercial outputs, animal welfare, environment friendliness, and public health. Modifying genetic makeup of livestock has been proposed as an effective tool to create farmed animals with characteristics meeting modern farming system goals. The first technique used to produce transgenic farmed animals resulted in random transgene insertion and a low gene transfection rate. Therefore, genome manipulation technologies have been developed to enable efficient gene targeting with a higher accuracy and gene stability. Genome editing (GE) with engineered nucleases-Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) regulates the targeted genetic alterations to facilitate multiple genomic modifications through protein-DNA binding. The application of genome editors indicates usefulness in reproduction, animal models, transgenic animals, and cell lines. Recently, CRISPR/Cas system, an RNA-dependent genome editing tool (GET), is considered one of the most advanced and precise GE techniques for on-target modifications in the mammalian genome by mediating knock-in (KI) and knock-out (KO) of several genes. Lately, CRISPR/Cas9 tool has become the method of choice for genome alterations in livestock species due to its efficiency and specificity. The aim of this review is to discuss the evolution of engineered nucleases and GETs as a powerful tool for genome manipulation with special emphasis on its applications in improving economic traits and conferring resistance to infectious diseases of animals used for food production, by highlighting the recent trends for maintaining sustainable livestock production. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

The genetic parameters investigated were the direct (h2d), maternal (h2m), realized (h2r), and total (h2T) heritability, as well as correlations (rd, rm, and rdm) within and between traits. The analyses were performed using single- and three-trait animal models with and without maternal genetic effects. In the three-trait model with maternal genetic effect, all estimates of h2d and h2m were significantly different from zero except the h2d of mean birth weight. Positive values of rd and rm between traits were observed as expected in the range of 0.322–1.000. Negative values of rdm were found within and between traits and were less associated with mean piglet weight traits than litter size traits. Estimates of h2T were consistently larger than those of h2r in both the single- and three-trait model analyses. In addition, the three-trait model can take into account the association between the traits, so the estimates are more accurate with smaller SEs. In conclusion, maternal genetic effects were not negligible in this study, and thus, a multiple-trait animal model with maternal genetic effects and full pedigree is recommended to assist future pig breeding decisions in this new breed. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Wheat is the most important crop around the world. Drought stresses affect wheat production and their characterization. Most of the traits that are affected by drought are quantitative traits, so detection of the quantitative trait’s loci (QTLs) related to these traits is very important for breeder and wheat producers. In this trend, 285 F2 individuals from crosses between four bread wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L.), i.e., Sakha93, Sids1, Sakha94, and Gemmiza9, were used for identified QTLs associated with plant height (PH) and leaf wilting (LW). Single marker analysis and composite interval mapping (CIM) were used. Results: A total of 116 QTLs loci were detected which covered 19 chromosomes out of the 21 chromosomes of wheat. PH and LW had 74 and 42 QTLs loci, respectively. On the other hand, chromosome 7A showed to bear the highest number of QTLs loci (15 loci). While chromosome 1A beard the highest number of QTLs loci related to PH (10 loci), chromosome 2B and 7A beard the highest number of QTLs related LW. We highly recommend our finding to help breeders in wheat breeding programs to improve plant height and leaf wilting. Conclusion: Our investigation concluded that SSR markers have high efficiency in the identification of QTLs related to abiotic stress; also the CIM method had more advanced priority for QTLs mapping. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Quantifying and predicting variation in gross primary productivity (GPP) is important for accurate assessment of the ecosystem carbon budget under global change. Scaling traits to community scales for predicting ecosystem functions (i.e., GPP) remain challenging, while it is promising and well appreciated with the rapid development of trait-based ecology. In this study, we aim to integrate multiple plant traits with the recently developed trait-based productivity (TBP) theory, verify it via Bayesian structural equation modeling (SEM) and complementary independent effect analysis. We further distinguish the relative importance of different traits in explaining the variation in GPP. We apply the TBP theory based on plant community traits to a multi-trait dataset containing more than 13,000 measurements of approximately 2,500 species in Chinese forest and grassland systems. Remarkably, our SEM accurately predicts variation in annual and monthly GPP across China (R2 values of 0.87 and 0.73, respectively). Plant community traits play a key role. This study shows that integrating multiple plant functional traits into the TBP theory strengthens the quantification of ecosystem primary productivity variability and further advances understanding of the trait-productivity relationship. Our findings facilitate integration of the growing plant trait data into future ecological models. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intraspecific variability in leaf water-related traits remains little explored despite its potential importance in the context of increasing drought frequency and severity. Studies comparing intra- and interspecific variability of leaf traits often rely on inappropriate sampling designs that result in non-robust estimates, mainly owing to an excess of the species/individual ratio in community ecology or, on the contrary, to an excess of the individual/species ratio in population ecology. METHODS: We carried out virtual testing of three strategies to compare intra- and interspecific trait variability. Guided by the results of our simulations, we carried out field sampling. We measured nine traits related to leaf water and carbon acquisition in 100 individuals from ten Neotropical tree species. We also assessed trait variation among leaves within individuals and among measurements within leaves to control for sources of intraspecific trait variability. KEY RESULTS: The most robust sampling, based on the same number of species and individuals per species, revealed higher intraspecific variability than previously recognized, higher for carbon-related traits (47-92 and 4-33 % of relative and absolute variation, respectively) than for water-related traits (47-60 and 14-44 % of relative and absolute variation, respectively), which remained non-negligible. Nevertheless, part of the intraspecific trait variability was explained by variation of leaves within individuals (12-100 % of relative variation) or measurement variations within leaf (0-19 % of relative variation) and not only by individual ontogenetic stages and environmental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that robust sampling, based on the same number of species and individuals per species, is needed to explore global or local variation in leaf water- and carbon-related traits within and among tree species, because our study revealed higher intraspecific variation than previously recognized. © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {Human land use causes habitat loss and fragmentation, influencing host-parasite associations through changes in infestation rates, host mortality and possibly local extinction. Bat-ectoparasite interactions are an important host-parasite model possibly affected by such changes, as this system acts as both reservoirs and vectors of several pathogens that can infect different wild and domestic species. This study aimed to assess how the prevalence and abundance of bat ectoparasites respond to forest loss, fragmentation, and edge length. Bats and ectoparasites were sampled at twenty sites, forming a gradient of forest cover, in southwestern Brazil during two wet (2015 and 2016) and two dry (2016 and 2017) seasons. Effects of landscape metrics on host abundance as well as parasite prevalence and abundance were assessed through structural equation models. Nine host-parasite associations provided sufficient data for analyses, including one tick and eight flies on four bat species. Forest cover positively influenced the prevalence or abundance of three fly species, but negatively influenced one fly and the tick species. Prevalence or abundance responded positively to edge length for three fly species, and negatively for the tick. In turn, number of fragments influenced the prevalence or abundance of four fly species, two positively and two negatively. Our results support species-specific responses of ectoparasites to landscape features, and a tendency of host-generalist ticks to benefit from deforestation while most host-specialist flies are disadvantaged. Differences in host traits and abundance, along with parasite life cycles and environmental conditions, are possible explanations to our findings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum, is a small, reef-dwelling, benthic shark that - using its paired fins - can walk, both in and out of water. Within the reef flats, this species experiences short periods of elevated CO2 and hypoxia as well as fluctuating temperatures as reef flats become isolated with the outgoing tide. Past studies have shown that this species is robust (i.e., respiratory and metabolic performance, behavior) to climate change-relevant elevated CO2 levels as well as hypoxia and anoxia tolerant. However, epaulette shark embryos reared under ocean warming conditions hatch earlier and smaller, with altered patterns and coloration, and with higher metabolic costs than their current-day counterparts. Findings to date suggest that this species has adaptations to tolerate some, but perhaps not all, of the challenging conditions predicted for the 21st century. As such, the epaulette shark is emerging as a model system to understand vertebrate physiology in changing oceans. Yet, few studies have investigated the kinematics of walking and swimming, which may be vital to their biological fitness, considering their habitat and propensity for challenging environmental conditions. Given that neonates retain embryonic nutrition via an internalized yolk sac, resulting in a bulbous abdomen, while juveniles actively forage for worms, crustaceans, and small fishes, we hypothesized that difference in body shape over early ontogeny would affect locomotor performance. To test this, we examined neonate and juvenile locomotor kinematics during the three aquatic gaits they utilize - slow-to-medium walking, fast walking, and swimming - using 13 anatomical landmarks along the fins, girdles, and body midline. We found that differences in body shape did not alter kinematics between neonates and juveniles. Overall velocity, fin rotation, axial bending, and tail beat frequency and amplitude were consistent between early life stages. Data suggest that the locomotor kinematics are maintained between neonate and juvenile epaulette sharks, even as their feeding strategy changes. Studying epaulette shark locomotion allows us to understand this - and perhaps related - species' ability to move within and away from challenging conditions in their habitats. Such locomotor traits may not only be key to survival, in general, as a small, benthic mesopredator (i.e., movements required to maneuver into small reef crevices to avoid aerial and aquatic predators), but also be related to their sustained physiological performance under challenging environmental conditions, including those associated with climate change - a topic worthy of future investigation.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Vector management programs rely on knowledge of the biology and genetic make-up of mosquitoes. Anopheles stephensi is a major invasive urban malaria vector, distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Middle East, and has recently been expanding its range in Africa. With the existence of three biological forms, distinctly identifiable based on the number of ridges on eggs and varying vectorial competence, An. stephensi is a perfect species for developing isofemale lines, which can be tested for insecticide susceptibility and vectorial competence of various biological forms. Methods: We describe key steps involved in establishment and validation of isofemale lines. Isofemale colonies were further used for the characterization of insecticide susceptibility and differential vector competence. The results were statistically evaluated through descriptive and inferential statistics using Vassar Stat and Prism GraphPad software packages. Results: Through a meticulous selection process, we overcame an initial inbreeding depression and found no significant morphometric differences in wings and egg size between the parental and respective isofemale lines in later generations. IndCh and IndInt strains showed variations in resistance to different insecticides belonging to all four major classes. We observed a significant change in vectorial competence between the respective isofemale and parental lines. Conclusions: Isofemale lines can be a valuable resource for characterizing and enhancing several genotypic and phenotypic traits. This is the first detailed report of the establishment of two isofemale lines of type and intermediate biological forms in Anopheles stephensi. The work encompasses characterization of fitness traits among two lines through a transgenerational study. Furthermore, isofemale colonies were established and used to characterize insecticide susceptibility and vector competence. The study provides valuable insights into differential susceptibility status of the parental and isofemale lines to different insecticides belonging to the same class. Corroborating an earlier hypothesis, we demonstrate the high vector competence of the type form relative to the intermediate form using homozygous lines. Using these lines, it is now possible to study host-parasite interactions and identify factors that might be responsible for altered susceptibility and increased vector competence in An. stephensi biological forms that would also pave the way for developing better vector management strategies.

	abstract = {Coral holobionts are multi-species assemblages, which adds significant complexity to genotype-phenotype connections underlying ecologically important traits like coral bleaching. Small scale heterogeneity in bleaching is ubiquitous in the absence of strong environmental gradients, which provides adaptive variance needed for the long-term persistence of coral reefs. We used RAD-seq, qPCR and LC-MS/MS metabolomics to characterize host genomic variation, symbiont community and biochemical correlates in two bleaching phenotypes of the vertically transmitting coral Montipora capitata. Phenotype was driven by symbiosis state and host genetic variance. We documented 5 gene ontologies that were significantly associated with both the binary bleaching phenotype and symbiont composition, representing functions that confer a phenotype via host-symbiont interactions. We bred these corals and show that symbiont communities were broadly conserved in bulk-crosses, resulting in significantly higher survivorship under temperature stress in juveniles, but not larvae, from tolerant parents. Using a select and re-sequence approach, we document numerous gene ontologies selected by heat stress, some of which (cell signaling, antioxidant activity, pH regulation) have unique selection dynamics in larvae from thermally tolerant parents. These data show that vertically transmitting corals may have an adaptive advantage under climate change if host and symbiont variance interact to influence bleaching phenotype. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Amphibious fishes have many adaptations that make them successful in a wide variety of conditions, including air-breathing, terrestrial locomotor capabilities, and extreme tolerance of poor water quality. However, the traits that make them highly adaptable may allow these fishes to successfully establish themselves outside of their native regions. In particular, the terrestrial capabilities of invasive amphibious fishes allow them to disperse overland, unlike fully aquatic invasive fishes, making their management more complicated. Despite numerous amphibious fish introductions around the world, ecological risk assessments and management plans often fail to adequately account for their terrestrial behaviors. In this review, I discuss the diversity of invasive amphibious fishes and what we currently know about why they emerge onto land, how they move around terrestrial environments, and how they orient while on land. In doing so, I use case studies of the performance and motivations of nonnative amphibious fishes in terrestrial environments to propose management solutions that factor in their complete natural history. Amphibious fish species have established a disproportionate number of nonative populations globally compared to fully aquatic species. Because of their terrestrial capabilities, we may need to manage amphibious fishes more like amphibians than fully aquatic fishes, but to do so, we need to learn more about how these species perform in a wide range of terrestrial environments and conditions.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Hypometabolism and hypothermia are common reactions of birds and mammals to cope with harsh winter conditions. In small mammals, the occurrence of hibernation and daily torpor is entrained by photoperiod, and the magnitude of hypometabolism and decrease of body temperature (Tb) is influenced by the dietary supply of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. We investigated whether similar effects exist in a non-hibernating large mammal, the red deer (Cervus elaphus). We fed adult females with pellets enriched with either linoleic acid (LA) or α-linolenic acid (ALA) during alternating periods of ad libitum and restricted feeding in a cross-over experimental design. Further, we scrutinized the role of photoperiod for physiological and behavioral seasonal changes by manipulating the amount of circulating melatonin. The deer were equipped with data loggers recording heart rate, core and peripheral Tb, and locomotor activity. Further, we regularly weighed the animals and measured their daily intake of food pellets. All physiological and behavioral parameters measured varied seasonally, with amplitudes exacerbated by restricted feeding, but with only few and inconsistent effects of supplementation with LA or ALA. Administering melatonin around the summer solstice caused a change into the winter phenotype weeks ahead of time in all traits measured. We conclude that red deer reduce energy expenditure for thermoregulation upon short daylength, a reaction amplified by food restriction. © 2023 by the authors.},

The possibility of selecting animals that are genetically more heat tolerant may provide additional means to maintain or even improve the productivity of the Canadian dairy industry, which is facing a shifting environment due to climate changes. The objective of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters for heat tolerance of milk, fat, and protein yields in Canadian Holstein cows. A total of 1.3 million test-day records from 195,448 first-parity cows were available. A repeatability test-day model fitting a reaction norm on the temperature-humidity index (THI) was used to estimate the genetic parameters. The estimated genetic correlations between additive genetic effect for production and for heat tolerance ranged from −0.13 to −0.21, indicating an antagonistic relationship between the level of production and heat tolerance. Heritability increased marginally as THI increased above its threshold for milk yield (0.20 to 0.23) and protein yield (0.14 to 0.16) and remained constant for fat yield (0.17). A Spearman rank correlation between the estimated breeding values under thermal comfort and under heat stress showed a potential genotype by environmental interaction. The existence of a genetic variability for heat tolerance allows for the selection of more heat tolerant cows. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) are a group of beneficial microorganisms, which live in close association with plants and possess multiple traits that improve the health of the plants. These microbes improve plant growth directly through mechanisms such as mineral phosphate solubilization (MPS), production of phytohormones such as auxins, gibberellins, or cytokinins, and/or by lowering the levels of plant ethylene (ET) enzymatically, as well as nitrogen fixation. Indirect mechanisms of improving plant health include reducing plant pathogens or sequestration of iron by secretion of siderophores, by the release of volatiles, etc. Further, the growth of plant pathogens may be directly inhibited by antibiosis, or these beneficial microbes may also induce systemic resistance in the host, whereby the defense machinery of the plants becomes activated against pathogen attack. Another beneficial trait of PGPR is their ability to induce systemic tolerance in the plants against abiotic stresses such as temperature, drought, and salinity. In most cases, tolerance is provided through enhancement of antioxidative response, a cascade of responses involving accumulation of osmolytes and phenolics, and high transcript level of stress-responsive genes during the stress period. In spite of a wealth of information available on the multiple beneficial traits of PGPR, its success has been limited due to problems in commercialization and marketing, since each PGPR-plant combination needs to be worked out in detail. However, it is heartening that research in the development of eco-friendly, sustainable microbial products are being commercialized worldwide, which is expected to increase globally to better plant health and productivity. © 2023 Jenny Stanford Publishing Pte.

	abstract = {High piglet mortality constitutes a welfare challenge in organic pig production. Litter characteristics were investigated from parities 1-5 of two hyper-prolific hybrids with different selection traits in an organic commercial herd (DanBred vs. Topigs Norsvin [TN70]). TN70 sows had more functional teats than DanBred sows, and their offspring had higher birth weights. Several interactions between hybrid and parity were found. The total born increased with higher parity and was more pronounced for DanBred sows. Litter weight at weaning was higher in parities 1-4 for TN70 compared with DanBred, and within DanBred parities 4 and 5 had higher litter weight at weaning than parity 1. The survival rate was higher for TN70 in parities 1 and 2 compared with DanBred, and for both hybrids, the survival rate was higher in parities 1 and 2 compared with parities 4 and 5. The number of weaned piglets was stable across parities 1-4 but lower in parity 5 for both hybrids. Thus, despite a lower number of total born piglets in TN70, TN70 sows weaned the same number of piglets as DanBred, with a lower mortality rate and a heavier litter at weaning. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {It has been claimed that smartphone usage constitutes a behavioral addiction, characterised by compulsive, excessive use of one's phone and psychological withdrawal or distress when the phone is absent. However, there is uncertainty about key phenomenological and conceptual details of smartphone addiction. One of the central problems has been understanding the processes that link smartphone usage, and addiction. The question this paper aims to answer is straightforward: based on measures utilised in the literature, what does ‘behavior’ mean in the context of smartphone addiction? A scoping review of the smartphone addiction literature was undertaken. This identified 1305 studies collecting smartphone addiction data. Just under half (49.89%) of all published smartphone addiction papers did not report the collection of any smartphone specific behaviors. Those that did tended to focus on a small cluster of self-reported behaviors capturing volume of overall use: hours spent using a smartphone per day, number of pickups, duration of smartphone ownership, and types of app used. Approximately 10% of papers used logged behavioral data on phones. Although the theoretical literature places increasing focus on context and patterns of use, measurements of behavior tend to focus on broad, volumetric measures. The number of studies reporting behavior has decreased over time, suggesting smartphone addiction is becoming increasingly trait-like. Both major phone operating systems have proprietary apps that collected behavioral data by default, and research in the field should take advantage of these capabilities when measuring smartphone usage. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Secondary metabolites (SMs), usually of complex structure and low molecular weight, have remarkable biological activities and, unlike the primary metabolites, are presented in low concentrations and in certain groups of plants. These, in turn, arouse great interest, not only for the biological activities exerted by plants in response to environmental stimuli, but also for the immense pharmacological activity they possess. Many are of commercial importance, not only in the pharmaceutical area, but also in the food, agronomy, perfumery, and other important sectors. In general, secondary metabolites are natural compounds produced in plants with the main objective of protection against abiotic and biotic stresses, besides having important nutritional and pharmacological aspects in human nutrition, they are also sources of aromatic additives, dyes, antioxidants and exert numerous functions. There are many ways to extract these compounds, but green chemistry can generate economic benefits in industrial chemical processes, such as reducing the need for investments in storage and effluent treatment, as well as the payment of compensation for any environmental damage. In addition, the use of bioresidues as promising sources of secondary metabolites is a promising way to promote the circular economy and take advantage of these by-products through bioactive compounds and their application as additives in new food sources. Currently one of the challenges is to produce sources of secondary metabolites from domesticated plants, since these have differences from wild ones, and the domestication process could preserve defense traits, such as changing the significantly, in addition to domestication-related climate changes, which may also attribute other characteristics to the secondary metabolites. Moreover, another interesting biotechnology applied to obtain large-scale SMs naturally produced by fungi is heterologous expression, which consists in the transcription of one or more genes from the cluster data gene of the fungi producing the target compound in a secondary host, which in most studies are yeasts or filamentous fungi. The use of these compounds in turn must be in force within the parameters allowed by legislation for food incorporation and in the industry in general, since they differ according to the sources, uses, toxicological levels, and the regulations regarding their certifications. However, secondary metabolites emerge as a promising source for new opportunities of application, emphasizing their potential to act as strong and natural additives for several industrial purposes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

	abstract = {Dairy processing is one of the most polluting sectors of the food industry as it causes water pollution. Given considerable whey quantities obtained via traditional cheese and curd production methods, manufacturers worldwide are encountering challenges for its rational use. However, with the advancement in biotechnology, the sustainability of whey management can be fostered by applying microbial cultures for the bioconversion of whey components such as lactose to functional molecules. The present work was undertaken to demonstrate the potential utilization of whey for producing a fraction rich in lactobionic acid (Lba), which was further used in the dietary treatment of lactating dairy cows. The analysis utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography with refractive index (HPLC-RID) detection confirmed the abundance of Lba in biotechnologically processed whey, corresponding to 11.3 g L−1. The basic diet of two dairy cow groups involving nine animals, Holstein Black and White or Red breeds in each, was supplemented either with 1.0 kg sugar beet molasses (Group A) or 5.0 kg of the liquid fraction containing 56.5 g Lba (Group B). Overall, the use of Lba in the diet of dairy cows during the lactation period equal to molasses affected cows’ performances and quality traits, especially fat composition. The observed values of urea content revealed that animals of Group B and, to a lesser extent, Group A received a sufficient amount of proteins, as the amount of urea in the milk decreased by 21.7% and 35.1%, respectively. After six months of the feeding trial, a significantly higher concentration of essential amino acids (AAs), i.e., isoleucine and valine, was observed in Group B. The percentage increase corresponded to 5.8% and 3.3%, respectively. A similar trend of increase was found for branched-chain AAs, indicating an increase of 2.4% compared with the initial value. Overall, the content of fatty acids (FAs) in milk samples was affected by feeding. Without reference to the decrease in individual FAs, the higher values of monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) were achieved via the supplementation of lactating cows’ diets with molasses. In contrast, the dietary inclusion of Lba in the diet promoted an increase in saturated FA (SFA) and polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) content in the milk after six months of the feeding trial. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this study, we monitored the breeding activities of the Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) simultaneously at a single tropical site and a single temperate site in China, compared the breeding performances of the two populations, and investigated the effects of weather conditions on reproductive success separately. The clutch and brood sizes of the Barn Swallow at the topical site were significantly smaller than those at the temperate site. Furthermore, the breeding success of the Barn Swallow at the tropical site was significantly lower than that at the temperate site. The mean daytime temperature had a negative effect on the clutch size and brood size at both sites; it had a negative effect on nestling survival at the tropical site, but not the temperate site. This study will help us understand the adaptation strategies of widely distributed bird species in different environments, and how climate change will affect birds in different climate zones. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As marine species adapt to climate change, their heat tolerance will likely be under strong selection. Yet trade-offs between heat tolerance and other life history traits could compromise natural adaptation or assisted evolution. This is particularly important for ecosystem engineers, such as reef-building corals, which support biodiversity yet are vulnerable to heatwave-induced mass bleaching and mortality. Here, we exposed 70 colonies of the reef-building coral Acropora digitifera to a long-term marine heatwave emulation experiment. We tested for trade-offs between heat tolerance and three traits measured from the colonies in situ – colony growth, fecundity, and symbiont community composition. Despite observing remarkable within-population variability in heat tolerance, all colonies were dominated by Cladocopium C40 symbionts. We found no evidence for trade-offs between heat tolerance and fecundity or growth. Contrary to expectations, positive associations emerged with growth, such that faster-growing colonies tended to bleach and die at higher levels of heat stress. Collectively, our results suggest that these corals exist on an energetic continuum where some high-performing individuals excel across multiple traits. Within populations, trade-offs between heat tolerance and growth or fecundity may not be major barriers to natural adaptation or the success of assisted evolution interventions. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Vernonia amygdalina (leaf), Garcinia kola (seed), and Leucaena leucocephala (seed) are three well-known tropical plants used in African ethnomedicine to reduce parasitic worm burdens and are potential sources of alternative solution for controlling parasitic helminths infection in grazing livestock. This study investigated extracts from these plants for anthelmintic activity against adult Haemonchus placei, an haematophagous nematode from cattle abomasa. Powdered plant materials were macerated in acetone and the crude acetone extracts evaluated for anthelmintic activity using H. placei adult worm motility assay. Afterwards, fresh sample of V. amygdalina was macerated successively in chloroform and acetone and the extracts evaluated for anthelmintic activity. The chloroform extract was subjected to phytochemical and FT-IR analyses and fractionated by vacuum liquid chromatography. Anthelmintic data were fitted to a nonlinear regression equation (Log [extract or fraction] vs. lethality; variable slope) to produce best-fit sigmoidal curves and LC50 values computed with associated uncertainty. Results: Of the three tropical plants, only V. amygdalina was active against adult H. placei with best-fit LC50 of 6.51 mg/mL (95% CI: 5.32–7.75). Evaluation of the two extracts obtained by successive maceration showed that chloroform extract (LC50, 2.46 mg/mL, 95% CI: 1.87–3.28) was 11 times as potent as acetone extract (LC50, 27.01 mg/mL, 95% CI: 21.32–48.57) (α < 0.0001). Chromatographic fractionation of the chloroform extract yielded four fractions (FA-FD) with FB (LC50, 2.38 mg/mL, 95% CI: 1.76–3.28) 2.19 times as potent as FC (LC50, 5.21 mg/mL, 95% CI: 4.40–5.79) against H. placei, while FA and FD were inactive. Phytochemical evaluation of the chloroform extract revealed the presence of saponins, steroids, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, and the absence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and anthraquinones. FT-IR structural analysis of chloroform extract indicated the presence of key functional groups which are chemical fragments/ structural motifs known to be present in the two major classes of bioactive compounds (sesquiterpene lactones and steroid glucosides) reportedly to be found in V. amygdalina. Conclusions: The findings showed that chloroform extract of V. amygdalina leaf possessed relatively good anthelmintic activity against adult H. placei. This could be indicative of its potential usefulness as an anthelmintic phytomedicine to control gastrointestinal nematodes infection in cattle. Key highlights: Extracts of three different plant materials (one leaf, two seeds) were tested against adult Haemonchus placei in vitro;Chloroform extract of Vernonia amygdalina was 11 times as potent as acetone extract;Fractionation of the chloroform extract yielded a bioactive fraction responsible for about 90% of the total lethal effect of the chloroform extract.Bioprocessing of V. amygdalina leaf could produce phytomedicines for organic livestock farming.

Here, using RNA-sequencing of laboratory-reared Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae of wild origin, we find changes in gene expression in thousands of transcripts consistent with a severe cellular stress response at both ambient and projected (+2°C and +4°C) temperatures. In addition, specific responses to stress, heat, and hypoxia were commonly identified in gene ontology enrichment analyses and 33 of the 44 genes comprising the minimum stress proteome of all organisms were upregulated. Earlier onset of the stress response was evident at higher temperatures; concomitant increased growth and mortality suggests a reduction in fitness. Temporal differences in gene expression levels do not correspond to differences in growing degree days, suggesting negative physiological consequences of warming beyond accelerated development. Because gene expression is costly, we infer that the upregulation of thousands of transcripts in response to warming in larval cod might act as an energetic drain. We hypothesize that the energetically costly stress response, coupled with increased growth rate at warmer temperatures, leads to faster depletion of energy reserves and increased risk of mortality in larval cod. As sea surface temperatures continue to rise over the next century, reduced fitness of Atlantic cod larvae might lead to population declines in this ecologically and socioeconomically important species. Further, our findings expand our understanding of transcriptomic responses to temperature by ectothermic vertebrate larvae beyond the critical first-feeding stage, a time when organisms begin balancing the energetic demands of growth, foraging, development, andmaintenance. Linking themolecular basis of a thermal response to key fitness-related traits is fundamentally important to predicting how global warming will affect ectotherms.  © The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {Diseases caused by ticks have a high impact on the health, welfare, and productivity of livestock species. They are also an important cause of economic losses in farms worldwide. An example of such diseases is theileriosis, which can be controlled by drugs or vaccines, although these are not fully efficient. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative and more sustainable and efficient complementary strategies. These may involve the identification and selection of animals more resistant to the disease. Several previous studies have identified significant differences in resistance between different breeds, with resistant breeds typically identified as those native to the region where they are being studied, and susceptible as those from exotic breeds. These studies have indicated that resistance traits are intrinsically related to the modulation of the immune response to infection. This review aims to systematize the general knowledge about theileriosis, emphasize resistance to this disease as a sustainable control strategy, and identify which traits of resistance to the disease are already known in cattle. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Physalis peruviana L. (physalis) has significant economic potential by virtue of the unique flavor of its fruit. However, the productivity of Brazilian plantations is low because of the limited number of varieties or cultivars available. The main obstacle in the selection of superior genotypes is the lack of information about genetic variability within-and between-populations and limited genetic basis that has likely resulted from evolutionary, domestication and selection processes of the natural or artificial populations. Physalis currently cultivated in Brazil is tetraploid, and such polyploidy may have led to the reproductive isolation of the species, preventing the occurrence of intraspecific hybridization. Moreover, cultivated populations derive from a common gene pool and have undergone a long process of domestication and selection carried out empirically by farmers. In Colombia and other Andean countries there are wild populations that exhibit genetic diversity which; although, fundamental for the conservation of the species, have low potential for the development of genotypes with superior agronomic traits. In order to create and expand the genetic variability of physalis, breeders have employed various strategies including induction of mutation, chromosome duplication, and interspecific and intraspecific hybridization. Furthermore, the production of double haploid lines from in vitro anther cultures has shown good results in the selection of hybrids. The mutant genotypes and/or hybrids obtained using these methods in association with those of wide genomic selection can generate cultivars with superior agronomic traits. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

	abstract = {Studies of long-term trends in phenology often rely on climatic averages or accumulated heat, overlooking climate variability. Here we test the hypothesis that unusual weather conditions are critical in driving adult insect phenology. First, we generate phenological estimates for Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) across the Eastern USA, and over a 70 year period, using natural history collections data. Next, we assemble a set of predictors, including the number of unusually warm and cold days prior to, and during, the adult flight period. We then use phylogenetically informed linear mixed effects models to evaluate effects of unusual weather events, climate context, species traits, and their interactions on flight onset, offset and duration. We find increasing numbers of both warm and cold days were strong effects, dramatically increasing flight duration. This strong effect on duration is likely driven by differential onset and termination dynamics. For flight onset, impact of unusual climate conditions is dependent on climatic context, but for flight cessation, more unusually cold days always lead to later termination particularly for multivoltine species. These results show that understanding phenological responses under global change must account for unusual weather events, especially given they are predicted to increase in frequency and severity. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Genetic analyses reveal three exotic-derived genetic loci underlying this heat tolerance which together increase yield by over 50% and reduce canopy temperature by approximately 2 °C. We identified an Ae. tauschii introgression underlying the most significant of these associations and extracted the introgressed Ae. tauschii genes, revealing candidates for further dissection.

The production and supply of soybean are critical steps due to their environmental impact and feed/food competition for land use. Therefore, research is focusing on finding alternatives to replace soybean partially or totally. However, alternative ingredients should ensure similar growth performance, carcass traits, and meat quality characteristics compared to conventional soybean-based diets. The objective of this review was to evaluate the impact of different alternative protein sources to soybean in pig nutrition and their effects on growth performance, carcass, and meat quality traits. The review process was performed on Scopus®, and it considered research findings published from 2012 to the present on the Sus scrofa species. Articles without a control group fed with soybean were discarded. The main alternative protein sources identified were other legumes and distillers’ dried grain with solubles (fish and animal proteins, oilseed by- and co-products). Interesting innovative protein sources included by-products from other industries (residues), microalgae and insects. Nevertheless, in dietary formulations, close attention must be paid to address the nutritional requirements, balance the supply of amino acids, avoid anti-nutritional or toxic compounds occasionally present in alternative protein sources, as well as determine the availability of protein feed in specific geographical areas. © 2023 by the authors.},

The “Pets-As-Ambassadors” hypothesis proposes that care for companion animals may lead to concern for other animals and for nature more generally, but little research has examined the attributional processes underlying this effect or how these mechanisms may increase one’s commitment to protecting nature. In two studies using American student samples, we investigated how perceiving companion animals as having greater capacities for emotional experience (e.g., feeling pain, pleasure) is beneficial for pro-environmental outcomes. Study 1 (n = 179) found that greater perceived pet emotional experience uniquely predicted greater nature-centered environmental motivations and pro-environmental behavioral intentions, whereas greater perceptions of pet agency (e.g., pets can plan, think) did not. Study 2 (n = 182) experimentally manipulated perceived pet emotional experience by having pet owners read articles describing companion animals as having either high or low capacities for emotional experience. Participants who read the high emotional experience article showed greater desire to help the environment compared with those who read the low-experience article, and this effect was mediated by greater nature-centered environmental motivations (when controlling for trait empathy). In addition to identifying attributional factors underlying the “Pets-As-Ambassadors” hypothesis, our findings support the two-dimensional model of mind attribution by showing how perceptions of emotional experience inspire biospheric concern and helping intentions, and they suggest a novel pathway for increasing pro-environmental outcomes by persuading people to see their companion animals as having sophisticated emotional lives. © 2023 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).},

	abstract = {Songbirds are currently the most prevalent animals in illegal trafficking in Brazil and other countries, so they are often confiscated, and this poses legal, ethical, and conservation challenges. Returning them to nature requires complex and expensive management, a topic that is sparingly addressed in the literature. Here, we described the processes and costs associated with an attempt to rehabilitate and release confiscated songbirds into the wild. A total of 1,721 songbirds of several species were quarantined, rehabilitated, and released, primarily on two farms located within their typical geographical distribution. Health assessments were performed on samples from 370 birds. Serology revealed no antibodies against Newcastle disease, and Salmonella spp. cultures were negative. Real-time polymerase chain reactions detected M. gallisepticum in samples from seven birds. Atoxoplasma spp. and Acuaria spp. infections, sepsis, and trauma were the top causes of bird death. About 6% of the released birds were recaptured, within an average period of 249 days after release, and at a mean distance of 2,397 meters from the release sites. The majority of these birds were found with free-living mates within or close to fragments of transitional ecoregions with native or cultivated grasslands, and native groves/forests, and shrublands. However, eucalyptus plantations with rich understory regeneration provided a suitable environment for the released forest species to settle, since they were recaptured during the defense of these sites. Over half of the recaptured birds presented behavioral profiles with both dominant and tame traits. Birds with dominant traits are more likely to settle in habitats and face the live decoys during fieldwork, whereas birds with tame characteristics tend to accept close contact with humans. Ultramarine grosbeak (Cyanoloxia brissonii), the least common species among those released, at the release sites showed an almost 2-fold recapture rate in the shortest mean distances from the release sites. This suggests less territory competition, perhaps a major factor of bird re-establishment here. The total per-bird cost was USD 57. Our findings suggested suitable survival and re-establishment of confiscated songbirds in the wild, when managed as we describe.

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Clonality is a key life-history strategy promoting on-spot persistence, space occupancy, resprouting after disturbance, and resource storage, sharing and foraging. These functions provided by clonality can be advantageous under different environmental conditions, including resource-paucity and fire-proneness, which define most mediterranean-type open ecosystems, such as southwest Australian shrublands. Studying clonality-environment links in underexplored mediterranean shrublands could therefore deepen our understanding of the role played by this essential strategy in open ecosystems globally. Methods: We created a new dataset including 463 species, six traits related to clonal growth organs (CGOs; lignotubers, herbaceous and woody rhizomes, stolons, tubers, stem fragments), and edaphic predictors of soil water availability, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from 138 plots. Within two shrubland communities, we explored multivariate clonal patterns and how the diversity of CGOs, and abundance-weighted and unweighted proportions. of clonality in plots changed along with the edaphic gradients. Key Results: We found clonality in 65 % of species; the most frequent were those with lignotubers (28 %) and herbaceous rhizomes (26 %). In multivariate space, plots clustered into two groups, one distinguished by sandy plots and plants with CGOs, the other by clayey plots and non-clonal species. CGO diversity did not vary along the edaphic gradients (only marginally with water availability). The abundance-weighted proportion of clonal species increased with N and decreased with P and water availability, yet these results were CGO-specific. We revealed almost no relationships for unweighted clonality. Conclusions: Clonality is more widespread in shrublands than previously thought, and distinct plant communities are distinguished by specific suites (or lack) of CGOs. We show that weighting belowground traits by aboveground abundance affects the results, with implications for trait-based ecologists using abundance-weighting. We suggest unweighted approaches for belowground organs in open ecosystems until belowground abundance is quantifiable.  © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Bromus tectorum L. is arguably the most successful invasive weed in the world. It has fundamentally altered arid ecosystems of the western United States, where it now found on an excess of 20 million hectares. Invasion success is related to avoidance of abiotic stress and human management. Early flowering is a heritable trait utilized by B. tectorum, enabling the species to temporally monopolize limited resources and outcompete the native plant community. Thus, understanding the genetic underpinning of flowering time is critical for the design of integrated management strategies. To study flowering time traits in B. tectorum, we assembled a chromosome scale reference genome for B. tectorum. To assess the utility of the assembled genome, 121 diverse B. tectorum accessions are phenotyped and subjected to a genome wide association study (GWAS). Candidate genes, representing homologs of genes that have been previously associated with plant height or flowering phenology traits in related species are located near QTLs we identified. This study uses a high-resolution GWAS to identify reproductive phenology genes in a weedy species and represents a considerable step forward in understanding the mechanisms underlying genetic plasticity in one of the most successful invasive weed species. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Body size is arguably one of the most important traits influencing the physiology and ecology of animals. Shifts in animal body size have been observed in response to climate change, including in bumble bees (Bombus spp. [Hymenoptera: Apidae]). Bumble bee size shifts have occurred concurrently with the precipitous population declines of several species, which appear to be related, in part, to their size. Body size variation is central to the ecology of bumble bees, from their social organization to the pollination services they provide to plants. If bumble bee size is shifted or constrained, there may be consequences for the pollination services they provide and for our ability to predict their responses to global change. Yet, there are still many aspects of the breadth and role of bumble bee body size variation that require more study.To this end, we review the current evidence of the ecological drivers of size variation in bumble bees and the consequences of that variation on bumble bee fitness, foraging, and species interactions. In total we review: (1) the proximate determinants and physiological consequences of size variation in bumble bees; (2) the environmental drivers and ecological consequences of size variation; and (3) synthesize our understanding of size variation in predicting how bumble bees will respond to future changes in climate and land use. As global change intensifies, a better understanding of the factors influencing the size distributions of bumble bees, and the consequences of those distributions, will allow us to better predict future responses of these pollinators. © The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {Background: Cotton is one of the important cash crops for fiber production globally. It is highly sensitive to abiotic stresses such as temperature, drought and salinity resulting in poor seedling germination and emergence leading to a decline in cotton productivity. Seed germination can be improved through physiological techniques mainly seed priming, which is a pre-sowing treatment that enables the seed to germinate more efficiently. Therefore, to assess the effects of seed priming on growth and yield production an in vivo study was performed with two different cotton cultivars (namely, BS-13 and FH-Lalazar). Methods: A field trial was conducted at Multan that comprised six treatments including T1: non-primed seeds (control) and treated seeds such as T2: hydro-priming (water), T3 & T4: hormonal priming (two different concentrations of indole acetic acid) and T5 & T6: halo-priming (two different concentrations of KNO3). The data were collected to evaluate the rate of seed germination, growth and yield of cotton under the effect of seed priming. Results: The study revealed that halo priming treatment with KNO3 enhanced the rate of seed germination by 83% as well as seedling emergence by ~90% in both cotton cultivars. Results showed that seed priming with KNO3 (3 g L-1) had the most promising effect on growth traits up to a variant extent as compared to the control plant. Meanwhile, yield attributes such as the number of cotton bolls and boll weight per plant significantly increased by 45% as compared to non-primed plants. Similarly, priming with KNO3 treatment displayed a significantly high cotton yield by 17% (767 kg ha-1) in both cotton cultivars as compared to their respective control treatment. Conclusion: Current study concluded that seed priming is an efficient and cost-effective technique that plays a vital role in better crop establishment consequently increasing germination rate, plant growth attributes and productivity of the cotton crop. © 2022, The Running Line.

	abstract = {Background and aims: Climate-change induced warmer spring temperatures advance tree leaf-out and result in earlier shading of the forest floor. Climate change also leads to more frequent droughts. Forest understorey herbs may respond to these environmental changes by varying traits at different hierarchical levels of organization. While trait mean variation at the inter-individual level in response to environmental changes is well-studied, little is known about how variation at the intra-individual level responds. Methods: We sampled genets of the forest understorey herb Galium odoratum from 21 populations in three regions in Germany, varying in microclimatic conditions. The genets were transplanted into a common garden, where we applied shading and drought treatments. We measured plant height and leaf length and width, and calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) at different hierarchical levels: intra-population, intra-genet, intra-ramet and intra-shoot. Key results: Variance partitioning showed that intra-shoot CV represented most of the total variation, followed by intra-ramet CV. We found significant variation in CV of plant height and leaf width among populations of origin, indicating that CV is at least partly genetically based. The soil temperature at populations' origins correlated negatively with CV in plant height, suggesting adaptation to local conditions. Furthermore, we observed that early shade led to increased intra-ramet CV in leaf length, while drought reduced intra-shoot CV in leaf width. Finally, intra-shoot leaf width mean and CV were independent under control conditions but correlated under drought. Conclusions: Our experimental results reveal correlations of intra-individual variation with soil temperature, indicating that intra-individual variation can evolve and may be adaptive. Intra-individual variation responded plastically to drought and shading, suggesting functional changes to improve light capture and reduce evapotranspiration. In conclusion, intra-individual variation makes up the majority of total trait variation in this species and can play a key role in plant adaptation to climatic change.  © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Nipah virus (NiV) infection is a viral disease caused by a Henipavirus, belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, responsible for a zoonosis. The course of the disease can be very serious and lead to death. NiV natural hosts are fruit bats (also known as megabats) belonging to the Pteropodidae family, especially those of the Pteropus genus. Natural infection in domestic animals has been described in farming pigs, horses, domestic and feral dogs and cats. Natural NiV transmission is possible intra-species (pig-to-pig, human-to-human) and inter-species (flying bat-to-human, pig-to-human, horse-to-human). The infection can be spread by humans or animals in different ways. It is peculiar how the viral transmission modes among different hosts also change depending on the geographical area for different reasons, including different breeding methods, eating habits and the recently identified genetic traits/molecular features of main virus proteins related to virulence. Outbreaks have been described in Malaysia, Singapore, Bangladesh, India and the Philippines with, in some cases, severe respiratory and neurological disease and high mortality in both humans and pigs. Diagnosis can be made using different methods including serological, molecular, virological and immunohistochemical methods. The cornerstones for control of the disease are biosecurity (via the correct management of reservoir and intermediate/amplifying hosts) and potential vaccines which are still under development. However, the evaluation of the potential influence of climate and anthropogenic changes on the NiV reservoir bats and their habitat as well as on disease spread and inter-specific infections is of great importance. Bats, as natural reservoirs of the virus, are responsible for the viral spread and, therefore, for the outbreaks of the disease in humans and animals. Due to the worldwide distribution of bats, potential new reports and spillovers are not to be dismissed in the future. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Reversing climate change requires broad, cohesive, and strategic plans for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from animal farming. The implementation and evaluation of such plans demand accurate and accessible methods for monitoring on-field CH4 concentration in eructating breath. Therefore, this paper describes a longitudinal study over six months, aiming to test a protocol using a laser methane detector (LMD) to monitor CH4 emissions in semi-extensive dairy farm systems. Over 10 time points, CH4 measurements were performed in dry (late gestation) and lactating cows at an Azorean dairy farm. Methane traits including CH4 concentration related to eructation (E_CH4) and respiration (R_CH4), and eructation events, were automatically computed from CH4 measured values using algorithms created for peak detection and analysis. Daily CH4 emission was estimated from each profile’s mean CH4 concentration (MEAN_CH4). Data were analyzed using a linear mixed model, including breed, lactation stage, and parity as fixed effects, and cow (subject) and time point as random effects. The results showed that Holsteins had higher E_CH4 than Jersey cows (p < 0.001). Although a breed-related trend was found in daily CH4 emission (p = 0.060), it was not significant when normalized to daily milk yield (p > 0.05). Methane emissions were lower in dry than in lactation cows (p < 0.05) and increased with the advancement of the lactation, even when normalizing it to daily milk yield (p < 0.05). Primiparous cows had lower daily CH4 emissions related to R_ CH4 compared to multiparous (p < 0.001). This allowed the identification of periods of higher CH4 emissions within the milk production cycle of dairy cows, and thus, the opportunity to tailor mitigation strategies accordingly. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Bovine anaplasmosis is one of the most important diseases that threaten livestock production worldwide es-pecially in developing countries, in cattle mainly caused by obligate intra-erythrocytic Anaplasma marginale. A. marginale is transmitted biologically by ticks (Hyalomma, Rhipicephalus). Bovine anaplasmosis causes mild to severe clinical signs ranging from anorexia, fever, anemia, and respiratory manifestations to icterus and death. Molecular detection is the best method for Anaplasma diagnosis because of its ability to detect sub-clinical and carrier hosts. This study investigated the occurrence of A. marginale infection among cattle in the Qena governorate utilizing a molecular assay based the msp5 gene. A total of 100 whole blood samples were collected randomly from apparently healthy and diseased cattle. Such cattle were examined clinically, and their samples were included for microscopic examination. PCR screening of the tested cattle showed 23% (23/100) as a positive rate. While 6 samples from 100 (6%) showed A. marginale parasite in the microscopic examination. Several risk factors were analyzed in the current study, higher incidence rates were detected in animals less than 2 years than older than 2 years, Holstein-Friesian breeds than crossbreeds and in animals kept in small farms than in the mass farming system. Clinical and hematological variables were also investigated in several infected and non-infected cattle based on PCR reactivity. Fever, anorexia, respiratory manifestations, enlarged lymph nodes, pale or icteric mucous membranes and digestive disorders were reported in infected cattle (n= 23) but not in non-infected animals (n=77). Consistently, hematological variables in infected cattle (n = 10) revealed significantly lower RBCs count and hemoglobin content than those in the non-infected group (n=20) indicating hemolytic anemia. This study shows the high prevalence of A. marginale in cattle in Qena governorate associated with health hazards and multi-risk factors, so frequent usage of acaricides, regular examination of cattle, and successful chemoprophylaxis are recommended. © 2011-2023 Journal of Advanced Veterinary Research.

	abstract = {This study was carried out to evaulate the effect of organic fertilization on the growth of common carp Cyprinus carpio cultured in rice fields and its effect on rice production as well as the possibilitd reducing the feed provided to fish. Four fields with an area of 100 m2 were cultured Yasmine rice represented four treatments. Common carp fish were cultured in it with a weight of 100 g/fish and a culture density of 100 fish/field. In the first treatment, organic manure was added without providing fish feed, second treatment, organic manure was added with fish feed, the third treatment without adding organic manure with fish feed, and the fourth treatment without adding organic manure and without providing fish feed. The results of the statistical analysis rate showed that T2 showed a significant increased(p≤0.05) in relative and specific growth in T2 compared to all treatments followed by T3. The results of the statistical analysis of the characteristics of the rice yield showed the number of dahlias, number of grains / dahlia, weight of 1000 grains and grain yield, showed a significant difference (p≤0.05) in T2 and T3 compared to T1and T4, while there were no significant differences(P>0.05) between treatments for the weight of 1000 grains trait. the study concluded that it is possible to apply the fish farming system in rice fields in Iraq by using organic fertilization (cow waste) and adding supplementary feed, as the T2 treatment gave the best growth for fish and rice © 2023, Iraqi Journal of Agricultural Sciences.

	abstract = {Agricultural environments are constantly jeopardized by abiotic stresses, including periodical droughts, temperature extremes, water deficit, flooding, salinity, and changes in atmospheric CO2 levels. These agro-climatic factors severely affect crop quality, productivity, and yield. Crop plants' responses to such drastic climatic stresses involve alterations in gene expression and extensive metabolic reprogramming, impacting their proteome and metabolome. Thereby, the plants ensure metabolic homeostasis and improved stress tolerance. Among multiple adaptive responses, the production and accumulation of low molecular weight, chemically diverse, bioactive, exogenous, and endogenous secondary metabolites (SMs) are noteworthy. Metabolites are spatio-temporal chemical footprints of the cellular state under particular physiological or developmental conditions that reflect the complex crosstalk between genotype and the environment. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the multi-parametric metabolic responses, analyze reconfigured metabolic networks under diverse stress conditions, and identify the underlying candidate genes in various metabolic biosynthetic pathways. Herein, we discuss the advances in analytical methods and sequencing technologies which offer high-throughput, cutting-edge, and cost-effective techniques for systematic identification of SMs and genetic dissection of commercially important agronomic traits. Integration of metabolomics with transcriptomics allows large-scale metabolite profiling with desirable accuracy and coverage, and mapping of trait-specific markers with high confidence levels, respectively. Inferring from large volumes of multi-omics data facilitates the identification of metabolic biomarkers and enables informed decision-making for crop breeding programs, which aim to develop climate-smart future crops with enhanced fitness, improved productivity, and increased stress tolerance. © 2024 Apple Academic Press, Inc.

	abstract = {Demand for rice labeled as organic is growing globally. Consumers state that foods labeled as organic are nutritionally superior and safer than their conventionally produced equivalent. The research question for this systematic review is as follows: is there a difference between the effects of sustainable agriculture and conventional farming methods on rice grain end-use quality, healthfulness, and safety? The studies (n = 23) examined for this review suggest that organic production practices don’t influence most end-use quality (e.g., chalk, milling yield, pasting properties) and healthfulness (e.g., gamma-oryzanol fraction and tocols) traits studied, or if it does, it will be to a small degree. If differences in end-use quality traits are found, they will be associated with grain protein content, which varies along with the dose of nitrogen applied during rice growth. We conclude that the studies evaluated in this review found that organically produced rice grain was less likely to contain residues of the pesticides (e.g., organochlorine) examined in the study than the rice is grown using conventional methods. There was some evidence that organically grown rice is more likely to be contaminated with mycotoxin-producing fungi and some mycotoxins. Common shortcomings of the studies were that they were poorly designed, with limited to no details of the cultural management practices used to grow the rice studied, the length of time fields was under organic management not stated, cultivars were not named, and the data wasn’t analyzed statistically. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Desiccation-Tolerant vascular plants (DT plants) are able to tolerate the desiccation of their vegetative tissues; as a result, two untested paradigms can be found in the literature, despite contradictions to theoretical premises and empirical findings. First, it is widely accepted that DT plants form a convergent group of specialist plants to water deficit conditions. A derived paradigm is that DT plants are placed at the extreme end of stress tolerance. Here, we tested the hypotheses that DT plants (1) are in fact convergent specialists for water deficit conditions and (2) exhibit ecological strategies related to stress tolerance, conservative resource-use and survival. Methods: We used biogeographical and functional-Traits approaches to address the mentioned paradigms and assess the species' ecological strategies. For this, 27 DT plants were used and compared to 27 phylogenetically related desiccation-sensitive vascular plants (DS plants). Key Results: We could not confirm either of the two hypotheses. We found that despite converging in desiccation tolerance, DT plants differ in relation to the conditions in which they occur and the ecological strategies they use to deal with water deficit. We found that some DT plants exhibit advantageous responses for higher growth and resource acquisition, which are suitable responses to cope with more productive conditions or with higher disturbance. We discuss that the ability to tolerate desiccation could compensate for a drought vulnerability promoted by higher investment in growth and bring advantages to deal with quick and pronounced variation of water, rather than to drought solely. Conclusions: DT plants are not only selected by drought as an environmental constraint. The alternative functional designs could promote the diversity of ecological strategies, which preclude their convergence to the same resources and conditions. Thus, DT plants are a heterogeneous group of plants in how they deal with drought, despite their desiccation tolerance ability. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Introduction: The goal of genome-wide association (GWA) studies of quantitative traits is to identify genomic regions that explain a substantial proportion of the genetic variation for the trait, with the ultimate goal to identify causal mutations underlying the genetic basis of the trait. The standard GWA approach is to genotype a population that has been phenotyped for the trait(s) of interest and genotyped for many genetic markers across the genome and to analyze these data by estimating and testing the effects of marker genotypes on phenotypes using a regression-type of analysis for each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), one at a time. Bayesian methods such as Bayes A and Bayes B assume a heavy tail prior distribution for SNP effects and use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from the posterior distribution. Although the objective of these methods was to predict the breeding value of selection candidates (genomic breeding values), they do that by estimating the effects of all SNPs. The estimated SNP effect, the proportion of variance explained by a SNP, or the number of times the SNP fits in the model with non–zero effect can be used as criteria to identify locations or genomic regions that affect the trait of interest. Results have shown that these Bayesian methods can effectively detect QTL in simulated and real data. Recently, a new methodology has been developed to address this limitation and allow for a better understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits through a gene network analysis. For this purpose, to identify genomic regions and candidate genes associated with egg weight (EW), a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in the present study using Affymetrix 600 K high density SNP array in 1,078 hens of 11th generation of Rhode Island Red. Materials and methods: Data available for 1,078 pedigree-recorded hens were used to collect phenotypic EW-related data. Seven traits, including egg weight at the first laying of hens, and egg weight at 28, 36, 56, 66, 72, and 80 weeks of age were collected for each bird. The analyses were performed using GenSel v4.73R, by fitting covariates for haplotype alleles in BayesA and BayesB models. A single Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain of length 41,000, including burn-in of 1,000 first iterations, was computed for each analysis to obtain posterior estimates of covariate effects. These were used to obtain a direct genetic variance for animals. The primary analysis showed that correlations and regression coefficients had converged at this chain length. Annotation terms and pathway analyses were conducted using protein analysis through evolutionary relationships of PANTHER software version 10.0. Results and discussion: The results showed that the BayesA method performed better in explaining additive genetic variance compared to BayesB method. Nine markers obtained from BayesA with the highest additive genetic variance were located on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, and 20. Genes that overlap in regions of interest were identified with the Ensembl BioMart data mining (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/) based on the Galgal6 assembly and the Ensembl Genes 96 database. The detected SNPs were located close to 35 genes, among which, the candidate genes of BPIFB2, OCX36, CPT1A, TCF15, CECR2, SIAH3, FADS1, FADS2, and SGK1 play important functions in the egg production process through the albumen protein formation, fatty acids metabolism, and eggshell formation. It is noteworthy that the present study has detected an association in regions different from that reported by previous studies. This can be because of flock particularities, such as the extent of linkage disequilibrium, allelic frequencies, and statistical approaches. Conclusions: The results of the present study showed that when the genetic architecture of studied traits follows infinitesimal model assumptions, the BayesA method usually performs better than BayesB. Moreover, considering the identification of new genome regions and the key role of the mentioned genes on the development of egg weight, the efficiency of the BayesA method can be confirmed for GWAS in egg weight traits. © 2022, University of Guilan.

	abstract = {Animal dimensions are essential indicators for monitoring their growth rate, diet efficiency, and health status. A computer vision system is a recently emerging precision livestock farming technology that overcomes the previously unresolved challenges pertaining to labor and cost. Depth sensor cameras can be used to estimate the depth or height of an animal, in addition to two-dimensional information. Collecting top-view depth images is common in evaluating body mass or conformational traits in livestock species. However, in the depth image data acquisition process, manual interventions are involved in controlling a camera from a laptop or where detailed steps for automated data collection are not documented. Furthermore, open-source image data acquisition implementations are rarely available. The objective of this study was to 1) investigate the utility of automated top-view dairy cow depth data collection methods using picture-and video-based methods, 2) evaluate the performance of an infrared cut lens, 3) and make the source code available. Both methods can automatically perform animal detection, trigger recording, capture depth data, and terminate recording for individual animals. The picture-based method takes only a predetermined number of images whereas the video-based method uses a sequence of frames as a video. For the picture-based method, we evaluated 3-and 10-picture approaches. The depth sensor camera was mounted 2.75 m above-The-ground over a walk-Through scale between the milking parlor and the free-stall barn. A total of 150 Holstein and 100 Jersey cows were evaluated. A pixel location where the depth was monitored was set up as a point of interest. More than 89% of cows were successfully captured using both picture-and video-based methods. The success rates of the picture-and video-based methods further improved to 92% and 98%, respectively, when combined with an infrared cut lens. Although both the picture-based method with 10 pictures and the video-based method yielded accurate results for collecting depth data on cows, the former was more efficient in terms of data storage. The current study demonstrates automated depth data collection frameworks and a Python implementation available to the community, which can help facilitate the deployment of computer vision systems for dairy cows.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Among different classes of HSPs, heat shock protein 20 (HSPB6) is a member of the small HSP family protein, the role of which has not been fully characterized in the context of heat stress in cattle. This study identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HSPB6 gene in Sahiwal cattle and their associations with heat tolerance traits (RR, RT and HTC). Three SNPs (SNP 1-3) were reported, which included two transitions, viz. SNP1-g.436G>A (Intron 1) and SNP2-g.2152A>G (3′-UTR) and one transversion, viz. SNP3-g.2417A>T (3′-UTR). The association analysis revealed that SNPs loci, viz. SNP1-g.436G>A and SNP2-g.2152A>G were significantly associated with heat tolerance traits. The GG genotype of SNP2-g.2152A>G was significantly associated with heat tolerance traits in Sahiwal cattle. The association analysis of four available haplotypes, viz. Hap1 (GGA), Hap2 (AAA), Hap3 (GAA), and Hap4 (AAT) of HSPB6 gene with heat tolerance traits did not differ significantly with any haplotype in Sahiwal cattle.

	abstract = {Tetratrichomonasgallinarum and Trichomonas gallinae can colonize the alimentary tract of domestic birds. However, little information is available on the epidemiology of the two trichomonad species in domestic free-range poultry in China. In this study, the occurrence and genetic characteristic of T. gallinarum and T. gallinae among free-range chickens, ducks, and geese in Anhui Province, China, were investigated. The 1910 fecal samples collected from 18 free-range poultry farms throughout Anhui Province were examined for the presence of T. gallinarum and T. gallinae by PCR and sequence analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene of T. gallinarum and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence of T. gallinae. The overall occurrence of T. gallinarum in poultry was 1.2% (22/1910), with infection rates of 2.1% (17/829) in chickens, 0.2% (1/487) in ducks, and 0.7% (4/594) in geese. The constructed phylogeny tree using the concatenated ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region and SSU rRNA indicated the T. gallinarum isolates detected in this study were closely related to previously defined genogroups A, D, and E, respectively. Nine (0.5%) fecal samples were positive for T. gallinae, with infection rates of 0.8% (7/829) in chickens, 0.4% (2/487) in ducks, and 0% (0/594) in geese. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that four T. gallinae ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences obtained from chicken feces and one duck fecal sample belonged to genotype ITS-OBT-Tg-1.

	abstract = {The trophic niche of a species is one of the fundamental traits of species biology. The ideal trophic niche of a species is realized in the absence of interspecific competition, targeting the most profitable and easy-to-handle food resources. However, when a competitor is present, species adopt different strategies to reduce competition and promote coexistence. In this study, we assessed the potential mechanisms that allow the coexistence of two generalist salamanders: the Italian cave salamander (Speleomantes italicus) and the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra). We surveyed, in April 2021, a forested area of Emilia-Romagna (Italy) during rainy nights. Analyzing the stomach contents of the captured individuals, we obtained information on the trophic niche of these two sympatric populations. Comparing our results with those of previous studies, we found that the two species did not modify their trophic niche, but that alternative mechanisms allowed their coexistence. Specifically, different prey preferences and predator metabolisms were likely the major factors allowing reduced competition between these two generalist predators. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Think about where you are for a moment; your country, your city or town, where you work, the place you sleep… All of the places where you spend different parts of your life, through various processes, affect your health. If you live in a poor, rural community in Nigeria, particularly if you spend time in and around local rivers, you might be at risk for contracting onchocerciasis (or “river blindness”), a parasitic nematode that can lead to blindness among its victims as early as age 20. In Mexico City, Mexico, you might occasionally experience extremely high levels of air pollution-so high that the city shuts down industry and restricts traffic for days at a time. In Tokyo, on the other hand, an even larger city which has taken great measures to curb pollution over the last several decades, the air quality is good by comparison. The environment can affect your health through social mechanisms, through how you are treated because of your identity-the way you and society view your race, gender, and other social traits. Being a middle-income African woman in Costa Rica has different implications for health, health care, and health-related behaviours than it does in South Africa or Scotland. This chapter focuses on how the processes around locations affect health and how, by studying these processes, we can gain a more complete understanding of how places and spaces are linked to health. While a central tenet of geographical inquiry is recognition of the deep links between different facets of places, the chapter is organised into sections by the key components of environment examined by geographers: the natural, built, and social environments. The following section will discuss the ways that maps-a basic part of the “language” of the discipline-and modern geospatial technologies can contribute to studies of health. Finally, the chapter concludes with a case study of some of the ways that the recent obesity epidemic is profoundly related to places and the environment. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

	abstract = {The aims of the present study were to assess the effect of an herbal diet (HD; basal diet plus a supplement with chicory herbs) on production traits and lesions scores in post weaning pigs, and to study possible boar x diet and genotype x diet interactions considering the two feeding groups HD and control (CON). In this regard, a cross-classified research design was implemented, aiming on an equal number of boar offspring in both groups HD and CON. Grouping of piglets (993 crossbred piglets from 14 different Piétrain boars sire to German Landrace or German Edelschwein sows) was done after weaning, and the feeding experiment was conducted in post-weaning period up to the pig age of nine weeks. Studied traits included the post-weaning weight (PWW) at the age of nine week 9, average daily gain (ADG) considering the period from weaning until week 9 and a skin lesion score (LS) at week 9. Herbal diet effects and sire x diet effects were inferred via linear models for Gaussian distributed PWW and ADG, and via generalized linear mixed models with a logit link function for categorical LS. Possible genotype x diet interactions were proved in multiple-trait models via Gibbs sampling, by defining same traits recorded either in CON and HD as different traits, i.e., post-weaning weight control (PWWCON) and post-weaning weight herbal diet (PWWHD), average daily gain control (ADGCON) and average daily gain herbal diet (ADGHD), and lesion score control (LSCON) and lesion score herbal diet (LSHD). The dietary treatment had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on PWW and ADG. The dietary treatment significantly (P < 0.05) influenced the behavior of the pigs, with a lower and favorable LS score for the pigs allocated to HD. Significant sire x diet interactions were identified for LS, PWW and ADG. Pearson correlations between estimates for sire effects from both diets CON and HD (i.e., the sire x diet effect) were 0.84 for PWW, 0.71 for ADG and 0.56 for LS. Genetic correlations smaller than 0.80 between PWWCON and PWWHD, ADGCON and ADGHD, and LSCON and LSHD indicate genotype x diet interactions, especially for the functional and low heritability LS. Hence, re-rankings of sires according to their estimated breeding values (EBV) were observed in both environments CON and LD, displaying smaller genetic and EBV variations for LS in the HD group. The HD dietary supplement contributed to fewer skin lesions, probably due to the favorable effect on pig behavior, but a more pronounced genetic differentiation seems to be possible in the more challenging CON environment. Generally, the results from the present study indicate the importance of genotype x feeding interactions for pig breeding, suggesting specific boars for different feeding environments. © 2022},

	abstract = {This chapter addresses in detail the various impacts of climate change on livestock production and welfare. Among all the environmental stressors, heat stress is of major concern as it has the most deleterious impact on livestock production especially in tropical countries which hold a major proportion of the world’s livestock population. One of the primary responses exhibited by animals under stress, especially heat stress, is decline in feed intake. This direct impact results in a series of events that is responsible for significant reduction in the productive potential of animals. The decreased feed intake in animals during heat stress has been proved to explain nearly half of the milk yield reduction in dairy cattle. Meat production is another critical economic trait which again is significantly altered due to heat stress. In dairy cattle, heat stress has been proven to alter the milk composition impairing its quality and ultimately the economic value. Reduction in milk fat and protein content in sheep and goat milk due to heat stress negatively influence the production of high quality cheese. Similarly, the meat quality traits and its governing genes expression patterns are also compromised in heat stressed animals. Further, climate change also induces changes in welfare variables governing behavior, physiological, endocrine, and metabolic as well as immune system related variables. In addition, climate change also affects the animal health particularly the vector borne diseases. Thus, climate change and its impact on animal production, health and welfare are of great relevance that needs to be addressed efficiently to sustain animal production in the changing climate scenario. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

However, the presence of fungal contaminants can influence the culture's performance and compromise the diagnosis. Objective: To verify whether the sample processing time can affect the performance of fungal culture for the diagnosis of Microsporum canis infection in cats. Animals: Forty Persian cats. Methods and materials: Hair and scale samples were collected by combing the coat using a 5 × 5 cm sterile polyester carpet. The carpets were assigned randomly to four groups based on time point of processing samples after collection (i.e. used for culture on a selective agar medium for dermatophytes): Group 1: 8 h (n = 10); Group 2: 24 h (n = 10); Group 3: 48 h (n = 10); and Group 4: 72 h (n = 10). Cultures were compared regarding the degree of fungal invasion by either M. canis or nondermatophytic contaminant moulds (NDM). Results: Processing samples after 24 h of storage resulted in increased isolation rates of NDM and decreased isolation rates of M. canis. Samples processed after 48 h and 72 h presented more than half of the plates with a high degree of fungal contamination (i.e. NDM occupying ≥50% of the total fungal mass). However, samples processed after 8 h and 24 h presented a lower degree (P < 0.05) of NDM plate invasion and higher recovery rates of M. canis when compared to samples processed after 48 h and 72 h. Conclusions and clinical importance: Delayed processing time is closely associated with the overgrowth of contaminants and with lower recovery rates of M. canis. © 2021 ESVD and ACVD},

	abstract = {Objective: Gross, histopathological, and immunohistochemical characteristics of uveal melanocytic neoplasms in dogs and cats were investigated. Samples: Thirty-two enucleated globes with uveal melanocytic neoplasms, 27 from dogs and 5 from cats, were examined. Procedures: Morphological characteristics of uveal melanocytic neoplasms in dogs and cats were evaluated with anti-PNL2, anti-Melan-A, anti-Ki-67, anti-caspase-3, and anti-BAP1 immunomarkers. Statistical analysis was performed to compare canine melanocytomas and melanomas. Results: The 32 uveal neoplasms were classified as melanocytomas (19/27 in dogs) or melanomas (8/27 in dogs, 5/5 in cats). Most tumours (84%) were located in the anterior uvea. Neoplastic cells were classified as epithelioid, spindle-shaped, mixed, or special type (balloon and signet ring cells). The percentage of cells with melanin, melanin concentration within cells, anisocytosis and anisokaryosis, mitotic count, lymphocytic inflammation, necrosis, vascular invasion, and glaucoma were also characterized. Anisocytosis, percentage of neoplastic cells with melanin, mitotic count, and indices (proliferation and apoptotic) varied significantly between canine uveal melanomas and melanocytomas; in general, melanomas had greater cell variability, were less pigmented, and had a higher mitotic count. The melanocytic origin of the neoplasms was confirmed by positive anti-PNL2 immunolabelling (29/32) and positive anti-Melan-A immunolabelling (3/32). In canine uveal melanomas, anisocytosis and anisokaryosis correlated with less pigmentation and minimal pigmentation correlated with a high percentage of immunolabelling for caspase-3. Conclusions: Uveal melanocytomas were more common in dogs, and uveal melanomas were more frequent in cats. Anisocytosis, percentage of neoplastic cells with melanin, and mitotic count are important histologic characteristics of malignancy to evaluate in uveal melanocytic neoplasms. The proliferation and apoptotic indices are relevant when comparing malignant tumours with benign tumours. © 2022 The Authors. Veterinary Medicine and Science published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Urban areas are expected to grow in the next decades, filtering bird species from the regional pool based on their life history traits. Although the impact of urbanization on traits such as diet, habitat and migratory behavior has been analyzed, their joint role with other traits related to plumage color has not yet been analyzed. Urban characteristics such as impervious surfaces, human presence and pollutants may be related to dark and uniform plumages. The objective of this study is to determine different bird species responses to urbanization using ordination analysis, and to characterize their life history traits combining information about diet, habitat and plumage color. Birds were surveyed along urban–rural gradients located in three cities of central Argentina. Species associations with urban characteristics were assessed through principal component analysis. Two axes were obtained: the first related positively to urban exploiters and negatively to urban avoiders, and a second axis related negatively to urban adapters. The scores of each axis were related to species traits through phylogenetic generalized least squares models. Species identified as ‘urban exploiters’ tended to nest in buildings and have uniform plumage, whereas those identified as ‘urban avoiders’ tended to be ground-nesting species with variable plumage. A third type, ‘urban adapters’, tended to be tree-nesting species with a low diet breadth, intermediate plumage lightness, low presence of plumage sexual dimorphism and high presence of iridescence. The results suggest that nest predation and habitat loss may exclude ground nesting birds from urban areas. The high density of pedestrians and domestic animals, such as cats and dogs, in urban centers may favor uniform plumages in birds that enhance camouflage. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Heat stress is becoming a significant problem in dairy farming, especially in tropical countries, making accurate genetic selection for heat tolerance a priority. This study investigated the effect of heat stress manifestation on genetics for milk yield, milk quality, and dairy health traits with and without genomic information using single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction (ssGBLUP) and BLUP in Thai−Holstein crossbred cows. The dataset contained 104,150 test-day records from the first lactation of 15,380 Thai−Holstein crossbred cows. A multiple-trait random regression test-day model on a temperature−humidity index (THI) function was used to estimate the genetic parameters and genetic values. Heat stress started at a THI of 76, and the heritability estimates ranged from moderate to low. The genetic correlation between those traits and heat stress in both BLUP methods was negative. The accuracy of genomic predictions in the ssGBLUP method was higher than the BLUP method. In conclusion, heat stress negatively impacted milk production, increased the somatic cell score, and disrupted the energy balance. Therefore, in dairy cattle genetic improvement programs, heat tolerance is an important trait.

	abstract = {The search for improvements in the poultry production chain and for increased egg productivity have grown significantly. However, intensive production with or by using of confinement systems negatively affect the welfare of animals and is favoring the appearance of harmful ectoparasites in production. Due to differences in the existing management systems, (e.g. Californian and cage-free systems) and given the importance of the poultry industry in the international market, the aim of the present study was: (1) to compare mite community between SIG (Intensive system – cage: Californian) and SIF (Intensive system – free: cage free); (2) egg-laying systems to analyze how the abundances of the ectoparasites Dermanyssus gallinae, Megninia ginlgymura, and Ornithonyssus sylviarum are affected by these egg-laying models; (3) to evaluate the association between the functional diversity found in traps, organic matter, and feathers in both systems; and finally, (4) to analyze how abiotic factors (e.g. humidity, temperature at sampling) affect mite community composition inside each model. A total of 860,571 mites were sampled, belonging to 59 taxa from six functional groups. Mite composition in the SIF system was different from the SIG system, while their variations in dispersion homogeneity were quite similar to each other. Although taxonomic composition is different between them, they are quite similar when clustered according to functional diversity. The variables 'humidity' and 'temperature' were not determining factors for the appearance of species. The species that most contributed for distinguishing the models were: M. ginlgymura, Dermatophagoides farinae, D. gallinae, Tyrophagus putrescentiae, O. sylviarum, Blattisocius keegani, Glycyphagus sp., Acotyledon sp., and Cheyletus malaccensis, respectively. Dermanyssus gallinae was strongly associated with the Californian model. Two taxa were highly correlated with cloaca, neck, dorsum, and inner wings; variations in relative air humidity also affected M. ginlgymura and O. sylviarum populations. Organic matter had a high abundance of predatory mites with potential for controlling mites of sanitary importance in the poultry chain. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of using conventional productivity-enhancing technologies (PETs) with or without other natural PETs on the growth performance, carcass traits, and environmental impacts of feedlot cattle. A total of 768 cross-bred yearling steers (499 ± 28.6 kg; n = 384) and heifers (390 ± 34.9 kg; n = 384) were offered a barley grain-based basal diet and divided into implanted or non-implanted groups. Steers were then allocated to diets that contained either: (i) no additive (control); natural feed additives including (ii) fibrolytic enzymes (Enz), (iii) essential oil (Oleo), (iv) direct-fed microbial (DFM), (v) DFM + Enz + Oleo combination; conventional feed additives including (vi) Conv (monensin, tylosin, and beta-adrenergic agonists [βAA]); or Conv with natural feed additives including (vii) Conv + DFM + Enz; (viii) Conv + DFM + Enz + Oleo. Heifers received one of the first three dietary treatments or the following: (iv) probiotic (Citr); (v) Oleo + Citr; (vi) Melengesterol acetate (MGA) + Oleo + βAA; (vii) Conv (monensin, tylosin, βAA, and MGA); or (viii) Conv + Oleo (ConvOleo). Data were used to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia (NH3) emissions, as well as land and water use. Implant and Conv-treated cattle exhibited improvements in growth and carcass traits as compared to the other treatments (P < 0.05). Improvements in the performance of Conv-cattle illustrated that replacing conventional feed additives with natural feed additives would increase both the land and water required to satisfy the feed demand of steers and heifers by 7.9% and 10.5%, respectively. Further, GHG emission intensity for steers and heifers increased by 5.8% and 6.7%, and NH3 emission intensity by 4.3% and 6.7%, respectively. Eliminating the use of implants in cattle increased both land and water use by 14.6% and 19.5%, GHG emission intensity by 10.5% and 15.8%, and NH3 emission intensity by 3.4% and 11.0% for heifers and steers, respectively. These results demonstrate that the use of conventional PETs increases animal performance while reducing the environmental impacts of beef production. Restricting use would increase the environmental footprint of beef produced for both domestic and international markets.  © 2022 Crown copyright.},

	abstract = {Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is commonly dysregulated in cancer, impacting diverse molecular pathways. CK2 is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase, constitutively active and ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotes. With over 500 known substrates and being estimated to be responsible for up to 10% of the human phosphoproteome, it is of significant importance. A broad spectrum of diverse types of cancer cells has been already shown to rely on disturbed CK2 levels for their survival. The hallmarks of cancer provide a rationale for understanding cancer’s common traits. They constitute the maintenance of proliferative signaling, evasion of growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling of replicative immortality, induction of angiogenesis, the activation of invasion and metastasis, as well as avoidance of immune destruction and dysregulation of cellular energetics. In this work, we have compiled evidence from the literature suggesting that CK2 modulates all hallmarks of cancer, thereby promoting oncogenesis and operating as a cancer driver by creating a cellular environment favorable to neoplasia. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Transition metal oxide NPs have delivered wide applications in various fields. Therefore, in this study, a novel fungus, Alternaria sp. (NCBI Accession No: MT982648) was isolated and characterized from the vicinity of medicinal plants. Eventually, in this method extracted proteins from isolated fungus were utilized to synthesize highly biocompatible zinc nanoparticles (ZnO NPs). The various physical techniques including UV-visible spectroscopy, TEM, HR-TEM, XRD, DLS, zeta potential, and FTIR were used to characterize particles. The UV-visible absorption (λMax) and binding energy for the as-synthesized particles were found to be 329 nm and 3.91 eV, respectively. Further, the polydispersed particles were revealed to have regular crystallinity with hexagonal wurtzite phase of ZnO with the spacing of ~2.46 Å under XRD and HR-TEM. The average size of a particle under TEM was found to be ~18 nm. The evaluation of various surface functional groups of particles was done by FTIR. The average hydrodynamic diameter of particles was found to be ~57 d. nm with 0.44 particle distribution index whereas the nanoemulsion stability was explained by Zeta potential (-9.47 mV). These particles were found to exhibit potential antibacterial and anticancer activities. They were found to be bactericidal against S. abony (MIC 5.73 μg/mL); B. pumilis (MIC 6.64 μg/mL); K. pneumonia (MIC 14.4 μg/mL); E. coli (MIC 8.7 μg/mL); B. subtilis (MIC 5.63 μg/mL) and S. aureus (MIC 12.04 μg/mL). Further, they are also found to be concentration-dependent anticancer and inhibited the growth of A549 cells (IC50-65.3 μg/mL) whereas they were found to demonstrate no any cytotoxicity against NRK normal kidney cell line. The internalization of particles into the nucleus (i.e., nuclear fragmentation and DNA damage) was confirmed by DAPI staining. The intracellular particles were found to generate excessive ROS. Further, the anticancer potential was also estimated by noticing a hike in oxidative stress parameters, cell viability, cell morphology, and change in mitochondrial membrane potential. We effectively synthesized potentially potent antibacterial and anticancer novel bioengineered ZnO NPs.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In the animal husbandry industry, more than 70% of the production costs are related to nutrition. Among the nutrients consumed by livestock, protein is one of the most important and expensive nutrients. Due to Iran's limitations in the production of oilseeds and consequently the production of protein meals, providing the protein needs of livestock has been associated with many problems. The use of new and especially local protein sources in ruminant feeding is one of the main solutions to cover the lack of protein sources and reduce the import of these sources, and it also reduces production costs in the livestock and poultry industry. Camelina sativa medicinal-oil plant has attracted a lot of attention, especially in recent years, and its most important advantage is extreme resistance to drought and cold conditions. The presence of high amounts of crude protein (CP), energy, and essential amino acids in camelina meal makes it a useful and potential option for use in the livestock and poultry feed industry. It was shown that the CP content of camelina meal was 41.9% of dry matter. Also, camelina meal has higher CP content and similar rumen undegradable protein compared to canola meal. In terms of lysine and methionine amino acids, which are important in muscle growth, camelina meal is considered a rich source. Camelina is a plant with a short growth period of 85-100 days and recently in Iran at the beginning of the camelina development project, the DH1025 line was produced, which is cultivated under the name of Soheil variety on a wide scale. Various studies have been conducted on the use of camelina meal for different purposes in ruminant nutrition. This is while there is little information about the nutrition of camelina meal and especially Soheil variety in the nutrition of ruminants in Iran. Therefore, this research aimed to investigate the effects of different levels of camelina meal on growth performance, rumen fermentation parameters, blood metabolites, and nutritional behavior of Lori-Bakhtiari lambs. Materials and methods: Thirteen Lori-Bakhtiari male lambs of four to five months of age with a mean live weight of 34.5±5 kg were used for 70 days of the experimental fattening period. Lambs were assigned to three experimental treatments (10 lambs per treatment) in a completely randomized design. Three experimental diets contained camelina meal at levels of zero (control), five, and 10% of dry matter (DM). Experimental diets were formulated according to nutritional requirement tables for small ruminants and were similar in terms of energy and protein. Also, the ratio of forage to concentrate in the diets was considered to be 30 to 70. From the first day, the animals were kept and reared in individual stalls. Two weeks before the start of the experiment (adaptation period), the lambs were vaccinated against enterotoxemia and the amount of 20 mL of anti-parasitic syrup (5% Clozantel) per 10 kg of body weight and niclosamide anti-parasitic syrup (seven to 10 mL per lamb) was fed to the lambs. Camelina meal used in this project was a genetically modified and localized variety. Experimental rations were provided in a completely mixed form (TMR) to the lambs daily at 8:00 am and 4:00 pm. Results and discussion: Results showed that increasing the level of camelina meal in the diet increased linearly the concentration of ruminal ammonia, propionate, and blood urea nitrogen (P<0.05), while ruminal pH and other individual volatile fatty acids, and blood parameters were not affected by the experimental diets (P>0.05). The activity of carboxymethyl cellulase enzymes decreased linearly with increasing the level of camelina meal in the diet (P<0.05). However, the activity of other rumen microbial enzymes was not affected by the experimental diets (P>0.05). In terms of behavioral traits, diets had no effect on DM and NDF intake, and also final body weight and average daily gain (P>0.05). Except for the amount of rumination and the ratio of rumination to DM intake, which increased linearly with increasing the level of camelina meal in the diet (P<0.05), other nutritional behaviors were not affected by the experimental diets (P>0.05). Conclusions: In general, the results of the present study showed that the use of camelina meal, as a new source of protein, instead of soybean meal up to 10% of dietary DM of fattening lambs is recommended. © 2022, University of Guilan.

	abstract = {Pure human and canine mammary invasive micropapillary carcinoma is a rare malignant epithelial tumor accounting for 0.9 to 2% of all invasive mammary carcinomas and present a high rate of lymphatic invasion and metastasis, with unfavorable prognosis. Surgery and chemotherapy are standard treatments for almost all mammary cancer in both species, as well as hormonal and target therapies available for human patients. However, depending on the patient's clinical staging, satisfactory therapeutic results for invasive micropapillary carcinoma are a challenge due to its high capacity of invasion and metastasis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoform is an important enzyme stimulated by cytokines, growth factors and oncogenes activation to synthetizes prostaglandins in inflammatory process. COX-2 overexpression is associated with angiogenesis and invasion and contributes to cancer development, disease progression, tumor recurrence and regional lymph node metastasis in human and canine mammary carcinomas. This enzyme can be targeted by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and its inhibition can reduce tumor growth and metastasis in several cancer types. Given the similarity between both species, the present study aims to elucidate the involvement of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression in canine (cIMPC) and human (hIMPC) pure invasive mammary micropapillary carcinoma, with clinicopathological and survival data. Twenty-nine cases of cIMPC and 17 cases of hIMPC were analyzed regarding histologic type, grade, age, tumor size, lymph node condition, extracapsular extension, inflammatory infiltrate and immunophenotype. When available, information on adjuvant treatment, recurrence, metastasis and overall survival were collected. The present study demonstrated COX-2 protein expression in 65.5% of cIMPC and 92.3% of hIMPC, and an association with more advanced histological grades in bitches and higher Ki67 in women. COX-2 mRNA expression was significantly higher in cIMPC than in hIMPC, and its expression was not associated with COX-2 protein expression in both species. COX-2 mRNA expression was associated with negative-ER hIMPC as well as higher Ki67. cIMPC demonstrated proportional early development, more regional metastasis, and a prevalence of negative estrogen receptor, than hIMPC. This is the first time COX-2 expression is associated with negative prognostic factors in both cIMPC and hIMPC, besides the overexpression of COX-2 protein in such unfavorable histological type, which suggests that COX-2 can act as a potential target in IMPC.

	abstract = {Enteric methane production from beef cattle contributes to anthropogenic climate change and represents inefficiency in the ruminant digestive system by allowing energy to escape into the atmosphere. Methane production is a heritable trait; therefore, it can be altered through selection. However, methane production is both phenotypically and genetically correlated to several economically important traits. Methane production is highly positively associated with dry matter intake, liveweight, and average daily gain. In addition, methane production also has low to moderate positive associations with carcass composition traits such as rib fat, rump fat, intramuscular fat, and ribeye area. Any reduction in methane production would reduce performance in these traits, and perhaps reduce profits. This review reports current estimates of phenotypic and genetic correlations between economically important traits and methane production, identifies research gaps, and provides a foundation for understanding the ramifications of using selection to mitigate enteric methane production in beef cattle. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Twenty barrows (10 CS and 10 LWxCS) were reared outdoor in a rotational pasture system according to the farm forage chain; pigs were supplemented with concentrate when needed (P); twenty barrows (10 CS and 10 LWxCS) were placed into outdoor fence as control and feed only concentrate (F). All pigs were slaughtered at 154 kg of live weight, on average. Carcass was dissected into anatomical cuts; tissue composition of lumbar sample joint was assessed and physical and chemical analysis on the Longissimus lumborum were carried out. Growth rate was similar among genotypes and feeding management, despite the differences in concentrate administered between P and F animals (488 vs 750 kg/head, respectively). As regard carcass and meat quality traits, rearing system showed almost no significant differences. CS showed a higher carcass yield (82.17 vs 79.63%), lower percentage of lean cuts (55.20 vs 60.40%) and a higher percentage of fat cuts (40.20 vs 34.47%) than crossbreed. As regards sample joint composition, CS showed higher percentage of fat. In chemical-physical analysis, few differences emerged for drip loss comparing CS and LWxCS (1.99 vs 2.77%) and for the moisture percentage comparing P and F (69.84 vs 68.57%). © 2022},

	abstract = {Mycorrhizae are associations between plants and beneficial fungi. They are the most active components of the plant’s nutrient absorption organs. On the other hand, soil microorganisms are fundamental for their functioning and dynamics as a living system. This research aimed to evaluate the effects of applying arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to the abundance of functional groups associated with the nitrogen cycle of soils with coffee plantations in Sasaima, Cundinamarca, Colombia. The soil samples were collected from four study plots during months 0, 2, and 8 and handled as follows: Plot 1. Application of liquid AMF (75-80 spores/gram of dry powder); Plot 2. Application of AMF in solid formulation (300 spores/gram); Plot 3. Application of native AMF, extracted from the soil under study (25 spores/gram); and Plot 4. Control, no application of AMF. The abundance of soil microorganisms associated with the nitrogen cycle was estimated using the most probable number technique to quantify ammonifying, proteolytic, ammonium-oxidizing, nitrite-oxidizing, and denitrifying microorganisms. The standard physicochemical parameters of the soil were measured. Afterward, univariate and multivariate analyses of the data were performed. The results showed a positive correlation between the application of AMF, organic carbon, and phosphorus, higher in the plots with native AMF. However, the abundance of functional groups of the nitrogen cycle did not show significant differences among the treatments; still, the principal components analysis showed a correlation between the plots with liquid and solid AMF, ammonifying microorganisms, and ammonium-oxidizing bacteria. © 2022, Facultad de Salud de la Universidad del Valle.

	abstract = {Hypothermia is one factor associated with mortality in newborn ruminants due to the drastic temperature change upon exposure to the extrauterine environment in the first hours after birth. Ruminants are precocial whose mechanisms for generating heat or preventing heat loss involve genetic characteristics, the degree of neurodevelopment at birth and environmental aspects. These elements combine to form a more efficient mechanism than those found in altricial species. Although the degree of neurodevelopment is an important advantage for these species, their greater mobility helps them to search for the udder and consume colostrum after birth. However, anatomical differences such as the distribution of adipose tissue or the presence of type II muscle fibers could lead to the understanding that these species use their energy resources more efficiently for heat production. The introduction of unconventional ruminant species, such as the water buffalo, has led to rethinking other characteristics like the skin thickness or the coat type that could intervene in the thermoregulation capacity of the newborn. Implementing tools to analyze species-specific characteristics that help prevent a critical decline in temperature is deemed a fundamental strategy for avoiding the adverse effects of a compromised thermoregulatory function. Although thermography is a non-invasive method to assess superficial temperature in several non-human animal species, in newborn ruminants there is limited information about its application, making it necessary to discuss the usefulness of this tool. This review aims to analyze the effects of hypothermia in newborn ruminants, their thermoregulation mechanisms that compensate for this condition, and the application of infrared thermography (IRT) to identify cases with hypothermia.

	abstract = {Depression, also known as major depressive disorder (MDD), is characterized by significant and persistent MDD. The pathogenesis of MDD is complex; some molecular markers have been repeatedly reported in MDD studies, hopefully making them reliable indicators of MDD. This study aimed to explore the correlation between each subtype of MDD. MDD data sets and the corresponding clinical data were collected using GEO database. Consensus cluster analysis was used to classify the MDD cases, using the WGCNA (Weighted gene co-expression network analysis) modules were identified using the dynamic tree cutting segmentation module and clinical traits, respectively. Based on the relationship between the color differentiation module and clinical characteristics, GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) was used to screen the genes with a higher degree of enrichment in the differentially expressed upregulated genes between each subgroup and the normal control, and to analyze their molecular biological function and the related pathways. We divided the MDD cases into three subgroups, the WGCNA analysis based on the subtype-specific characteristics showed that six WGCNA modules were correlated with the clinical characteristics. GSEA was used to screen the expression of MARCKS, TAAR1, and ITGB1, among other molecular markers. The main metabolic pathways in which these molecular markers participate include axon guidance, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, prion infection, and pyrimidine metabolism. Cases from different subgroups may have their specific or dominant gene expression patterns, and that the biomarker levels can help assess the severity of MDD, predict outcomes, or guide clinical treatment.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Thirty-three percent of the world's farmland is subject to drought, making it the most difficult abiotic stress on rice production. Ten different M4-rice mutants were tested, along with three check varieties (Giza 179, Sakha 107, and IET1444-International check variety for drought stress), to see how well they fared in drought conditions. These genotypes were tested in well-watered (WW: irrigation every 4 days), water-stressed (WS1: irrigation every 8 days), and severe water-stressed (WS2: irrigation every 12 days) conditions across generations M5 to M8. Drought stress was measured regarding its effect on agronomic traits and drought tolerance indices. Of the ten tested mutants, seven high-tillering mutants had higher yields under normal and stress conditions than the check varieties did in the field. The STI, MP, YI, and GMP indices show that, compared to IET444 (DT check variety), the mutant EN25 performed best under drought stress, followed by the mutant EN27. According to the data analysis of SCoT markers, only 34 of the 46 primers used amplified 377 bands (alleles) across 53 different markers. There was a wide range of genetic similarities among mutants, parents, and the check varieties, and it ranged from 17% to 78%. These seven mutants shared 13 common bands with the most drought-tolerant check variety (IET444) using SCoT markers, which indicates that these mutants carried some drought-tolerant genes. Hence, these mutants hold great potential for use in drought-stressed rice breeding programs. © 2022, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

	abstract = {The Convention on Biological Diversity classifies “Invasive Alien Species” as those whose introduction and spread represents a threat for biodiversity. Introduction of alien pathogens, including parasites, is one of the main consequences of the introduction of invasive alien species. The objective of this work was to assess the parasite community composition in native lagomorphs (Lepus europaeus and Lepus timidus varronis) in sympatric and non-sympatric conditions with an alien lagomorph (Sylvilagus floridanus), and to evaluate the phenotypic traits of exotic parasites in such conditions. We firstly describe the characteristics of the parasite community in the different host species (richness, prevalence, abundance and intensity), and, secondly, the phenotypic traits of the observed parasite species in each host. Nine helminths were reported on: eight nematodes (Obeliscoides cuniculi, Trichostrongylus calcaratus, Trichostrongylus retortaeformis, Trichostrongylus affinis, Trichuris leporis, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Passalurus ambiguus, and Nematodirus sp.) and one unidentified cestode. In addition, exotic parasites showed significantly different phenotypic plasticity after spillover from S. floridanus to L. europaeus, whereas endemic parasite species were not isolated in the alien S. floridanus. Our results highlight that the community of autochthonous and allochthonous Lagomorpha in northwestern Italy represents an extremely interesting system for modelling ecological and evolutionary interactions between parasites and their hosts. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The objectives of the study were to estimate the repeatability of health and welfare traits and investigate their association with performance in three breeds of dairy goats reared under low-input farming systems in Greece. A total of 1210 goats of Eghoria (n = 418), Skopelos (n = 429), and Damascus (n = 363) breeds were assessed. Udder health, parasitic resistance, welfare, milk yield and quality, and body condition score were recorded monthly for two milking periods. Udder health records included somatic cell count (SCC) and total viable count (TVC). Based on combinations of SCC and TVC and thresholds set at >106 cells/mL and >2 × 104 cfu/mL, respectively, additional udder health phenotypes were defined. Parasitism included myiasis, tick infestation, gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) and cestode faecal egg count (FEC), and lungworm faecal larval count (FLC). Infection with each of the endoparasites was defined based on FEC/FLC. Welfare assessment parameters included the presence of ear and horn injuries, ocular and nasal discharge, body and udder abscesses, injury and lesions on the skin of different regions, diarrhoea, hernias, overgrown hooves, arthritis, lameness, and udder asymmetry. Trait repeatability and animal correlations were estimated. Significant (p < 0.05) repeatability was reported for all udder health and most welfare traits in all breeds, GIN and cestode FEC, and GIN and lungworm infection in Eghoria, and myiasis in Skopelos. Correlations of health and most of welfare traits with performance were non-significant or favourable.

	abstract = {Chronic nausea and vomiting syndromes (NVSs) are prevalent and debilitating disorders. Putative mechanisms include gastric neuromuscular disease and dysregulation of brain-gut interaction, but clinical tests for objectively defining gastric motor function are lacking. A medical device enabling noninvasive body surface gastric mapping (BSGM) was developed and applied to evaluate NVS pathophysiology. BSGM was performed in 43 patients with NVS and 43 matched controls using Gastric Alimetry (Alimetry), a conformable high-resolution array (8 × 8 electrodes; 20-mm interelectrode spacing), wearable reader, and validated symptom-logging app. Continuous measurement encompassed a fasting baseline (30 minutes), 482-kilocalorie meal, and 4-hour postprandial recording, followed by spectral and spatial biomarker analyses. Meal responses were impaired in NVS, with reduced amplitudes compared to controls (median, 23.3 microvolts versus 38.0 microvolts, P < 0.001), impaired fed-fasting power ratios (1.1 versus 1.6, P = 0.02), and disorganized slow waves (spatial frequency stability, 13.6 versus 49.5; P < 0.001). Two distinct NVS subgroups were evident with indistinguishable symptoms (all P > 0.05). Most patients (62%) had normal BSGM studies with increased psychological comorbidities (43.5% versus 7.7%; P = 0.03) and anxiety scores (median, 16.5 versus 13.0; P = 0.035). A smaller subgroup (31%) had markedly abnormal BSGM, with biomarkers correlating with symptoms (nausea, pain, excessive fullness, early satiety, and bloating; all r > 0.35, P < 0.05).

	abstract = {Introduction: The importance of androgen-estrogen balance has been postulated to be more than complete levels of estrogen or androgen for an optimum reproductive function in males. In aged broiler breeder males, the low fertility is influenced by greater plasma and testicular estradiol as well as a low synthesis of plasma and testicular testosterone concentrations. Since aromatase is the main enzyme that converts the androgens into estrogens; therefore, it has been hypothesized that using the aromatase inhibitors could increase endogenous testosterone production without an associated increase in circulating estrogens. It is hypothesized that these steroid hormone changes that occur during post-peak fertility can affect the expression of several genes whose activity may be associated with steroid hormone changes, including Foxj1, PVRL3, and LPR2 genes. Estradiol plays a vital role in the proliferation and differentiation of the epithelial cells, which cause activation of the Foxj1 gene in these cells. The knocked-out mice for the Fox j1 gene (epithelium lacked ciliated cells) informing the importance of Foxj1 in estradiol-dependent epithelial cell differentiation. In this study, the effects of an aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, were evaluated on reproductive indices of broiler breeder roosters at short-term (three weeks) and during an interval (three days of use and two days of a stop). Materials and methods: Eighteen 55-weeks-old roosters were randomly divided into three groups receiving letrozole T0, T1, and T2 (0, 0.015, and 0.03 mg/kg of body weight, respectively). Deranged semen was collected via a syringe from the distal cauda of the vas deferens from each rooster as a single sample (n=6). Seminal traits, steroid hormone concentrations, the relative abundance of Pvrl3, Foxj1, and Lpr2 mRNA, and in vitro fertility were assessed at the end of the trial. Testes were carefully removed and the epididymal region was dissected free of extraneous tissues and weighed to determine the gonadal/somatic index [testis weight (g)/body weight (kg)]. Total RNA was extracted from the tissues using the TRI® reagent (Ambion, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The nucleotide sequences of all candidate genes of the roosters (Gallus gallus) were obtained from the GenBank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The primer was designed using Primer3Plus online software and assessed using OligoCalc and PrimerBLAST. Beta-actin was considered an internal control. Quantification of all transcripts was performed using QuantiFast Eva Green PCR Kit (HOT FIRE Pol® EvaGreen ® qPCR Mix Plus) in a 20 μL reaction volume containing 3 μL single-strand cDNA, 7 μL of the master mix, 0.75 μL of either forward and reverse primers, and 8.5 μL of distilled H2O in 20 μL by a Rotor-Gene 6000 Real-Time PCR software (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). The data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Single and repeated measurement data were analyzed with the GLM and Mixed procedures of SAS software. Rooster's testicular data and body weight were considered as covariates in the statistical models. Duncan’s multiple range test was used to compare means. Sperm quality characteristics and in vivo fertility were analyzed with the same models. Results and discussion: The results showed that gonadal somatic index (GSI), sperm total and forward motility, viability, membrane integrity, semen concentration, and fertility rate were improved for letrozole groups compared with the control group (P<0.001). Lipid peroxidation and sperm abnormalities measurements in the T1 and T2 groups were lower compared to the control group. The epithelium thickness and tubular diameter of seminiferous, and the epididymal and testes sperm count increased in the T1 and T2 groups. A concentration of testosterone was statistically increased in T2 group and testicular concentration testosterone was lower in both letrozole groups compared to the control group. FSH concentration was significantly influenced by letrozole (P<0.05). Plasma concentration of estrogen decreased in the T1 and T2 groups and the lowest one was in T2 group, also testicular concentration was lower compared with the control group. The ratio of estrogen to testosterone was significantly influenced by T1 group. An increase in relative mRNA levels was observed for a PVRL3 gene (related to spermiation) in testes, and a decrease of Foxj1 gene (related to ciliogenesis) and LPR2 in epididymal (related to endocytosis) in the T1 and T2 groups. Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, using aromatase inhibitor improved reproductive indices in aged broiler breeder roosters. It is suggested that increasing testosterone alone cannot improve reproductive performance and a balance in the estradiol/testosterone ratio is necessary to achieve optimal fertility. © 2022, University of Guilan.

With the development of genome sequencing technologies, new opportunities are opening up for more accurate identification of areas associated with these traits. This article aims to develop a novel approach to the lifetime evaluation of cattle by 3-D visualization of economic-biological and genetic features. The purpose of this study was to identify significant variants underlying differences in the qualitative characteristics of meat, using imputed data on the sequence of the entire genome. Samples of biomaterial of young Aberdeen-Angus breed cattle (n = 96) were the material for carrying out genome-wide SNP genotyping. Genotyping was performed using a high-density DNA chip Bovine GPU HD BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), containing ~150 thousand SNPs. The following indicators were selected as phenotypic features: chest width and chest girth retrieved by 3-D model and meat output on the bones. Correlation analysis showed a reliable positive relationship between chest width and meat output on the bones, which can potentially be used for lifetime evaluation of meat productivity of animals. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Levant Basin is in many ways the world’s most invaded marine ecosystem owing to the existence of the man-made Suez Canal. The invasion of free-living organisms through this pathway is increasingly documented and monitored in the past two decades, and their ecological impact recognized. Nonetheless, while tremendous scientific effort is invested in documenting introduced fishes, co-introduction events of these fishes and their parasites have drawn relatively little interest. In our research, we examined the presence of gill parasites (Monogenea) on the invasive narrow barred Spanish mackerel Scomberomorus commerson which has been known in the Mediterranean Sea for 80 years. The gills of S. commerson supported numerous, relatively large monogeneans (Monogenea: Gastrocotylinea), reaching prevalence levels of 100% with a mean intensity of ~ 80 worms per host. Using an integrated molecular and morphological approach, four gastrocotylinean species were identified: Gotocotyla acanthura, Cathucotyle cathuaui, Pricea multae, and Pseudothoracocotyla ovalis. Two species, C. cathuaui and P. ovalis, are reported here for the first time from the Mediterranean. Sequences of the 28S rRNA gene of G. acanthura from native hosts, Pomatomus saltatrix and Trachinotus ovatus, differed from individuals collected from S. commerson by 1.8%. We therefore suggest that the taxonomic status and distribution of G. acanthura should be revisited, and we recommend an integrated approach as essential to accurately detect co-introductions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The molecular and genetic effects of heat stress are not as well understood as physiological effects. Heat Stress response should be considered one component of gene network coordinated across various cells, tissues and systems. Its action seeks to minimize the effects of the environment on cellular functions. The detection of selection signatures can identify genes and mutations associated with phenotypic traits even if they are no longer segregating within the populations of interest. This paper looked at 48 sheep breeds (1988 animals), of which 649 animals are from 6 Brazilian breeds reared in a tropical environment. These animals were genotyped using the 50 K SNP Chip. We applied different detection methods (HapFLK and PCAdapt) to identify genomic regions with selection signals (selection signatures). Three groups of breeds were defined, and the first component showed a clear separation between Hair_Warm and Wool_Cold groups. The second component showed some divergence between Wool_Cold and Wool_Warm, with some Hair_Warm breeds located together with Wool_Warm. Hair Brazilian breeds were separated from the others in the first breed component, while the second component segregated European breeds from African and Asian breeds. The four genomic regions identified in chromosomes 2, 7, 11 and 16 harbor several genes related to a wide range of functions. These include production traits (such as milk, growth and reproduction), metabolism (fat and energy), stress response (including immune and inflammation), as well as cell cycle functions. These genomic regions can be a starting point for identifying gene mutations and selecting adapted animals, mainly in a climate change scenario. The locally adapted tropical sheep breeds can be an important genetic reservoir of these thermotolerance genes. © 2022},

	abstract = {Increases in temperature and extreme weather events due to global warming can create an environment that is beneficial to mosquito populations, changing and possibly increasing the suitable geographical range for many vector-borne diseases. West Nile Virus (WNV) is a flavivirus, maintained in a mosquito–avian host cycle that is usually asymptomatic but can cause primarily flu-like symptoms in human and equid accidental hosts. In rare circumstances, serious disease and death are possible outcomes for both humans and horses. The main European vector of WNV is the Culex pipiens mosquito. This study examines the effect of environmental temperature on WNV establishment in Europe via Culex pipiens populations through use of a basic reproduction number ((Formula presented.)) model. A metric of thermal suitability derived from (Formula presented.) was developed by collating thermal responses of different Culex pipiens traits and combining them through use of a next-generation matrix. WNV establishment was determined to be possible between 14°C and 34.3°C, with the optimal temperature at 23.7°C. The suitability measure was plotted against monthly average temperatures in 2020 and the number of months with high suitability mapped across Europe. The average number of suitable months for each year from 2013 to 2019 was also calculated and validated with reported equine West Nile fever cases from 2013 to 2019. The widespread thermal suitability for WNV establishment highlights the importance of European surveillance for this disease and the need for increased research into mosquito and bird distribution. © 2022 Crown copyright.

	abstract = {Tenderness is one of the most important meat quality traits. It has been suggested that a short-term dietary protein restriction prior to slaughter could change muscle protein turnover and improve meat tenderness without affecting animal performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a short-term dietary protein restriction in the end of the finishing phase on skeletal muscle metabolome and meat quality traits of culled ewes. Fourteen crossbred ewes (3 years of age) averaging 39.3 ± 9.4 kg of body weight (BW) were enrolled in this study. Culled ewes were grouped (n = 7) and randomly assigned to one of the following treatments, consisting of: continuously fed the control diet with 13.3% of crude protein (CTRL); fed the control diet to reach the target body weight (45 kg) followed by 14 days feeding a low protein diet (4.33% crude protein; STR). The experiment lasted 46 days. Short-term dietary protein restriction increased meat shear-force at 1 day postmortem (3.67 vs. 3.02 kgf; P = 0.04), which could be partially explained by the higher total collagen content (P = 0.02) in STR compared to CTRL group (2.35 vs. 2.05 mg/g). The protein restriction did not affect final body weight nor carcass weight (P > 0.05), but decreased backfat thickness (3.19 vs. 5.10 mm; P = 0.04). Excreted and retained nitrogen were respectively 80.4% and 70% lower in STR (P < 0.01) than in the CTRL group. A lower abundance of valine (P = 0.02) and asparagine (P = 0.01) was observed in skeletal muscle of STR ewes compared to the CTRL group. Of the muscle metabolites identified, progesterone, succinic acid, and tartronic acid were positively correlated with meat shear-force (toughness), while lysine was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with the same trait. Collectively, our data shows that despite the changes observed in the skeletal muscle for the abundance of metabolites involved in energy and protein metabolism, the short-term dietary protein restriction near maintenance level prior to slaughter did not improve quality of ewes’ meat quality traits. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Objective: Luxi Black Head sheep (LBH) is the first crossbreed specialized for meat production and was developed by crossbreeding Black Head Dorper sheep (DP) and Small Tailed Han sheep (STH) in the farming areas of northern China. Research on the genomic variations and selection signatures of LBH caused by continuous artificial selection is of great significance for identifying the genetic mechanisms of important traits of sheep and for the continuous breeding of LBH. Methods: We explored the genetic relationships of LBH, DP, and several Mongolian sheep breeds by constructing phylogenetic tree, principal component analysis and linkage disequilibrium analysis. In addition, we analysed 29 whole genomes of sheep. The genomewide selection signatures have been scanned with four methods: heterozygosity (HP), fixation index (FST), crosspopulation extended haplotype homozygosity (XPEHH) and the nucleotide diversity (θπ) ratio. Results: The genetic relationships analysis showed that LBH appeared to be an independent cluster closer to DP. The candidate signatures of positive selection in sheep genome revealed candidate genes for developmental process (HoxA gene cluster, BCL2L11, TSHR), immunity (CXCL6, CXCL1, SKAP2, PTK6, MST1R), growth (PDGFD, FGF18, SRF, SOCS2), and reproduction (BCAS3, TRIM24, ASTL, FNDC3A). Moreover, two signalling pathways closely related to reproduction, the thyroid hormone signalling pathway and the oxytocin signalling pathway, were detected. Conclusion: The selective sweep analysis of LBH genome revealed candidate genes and signalling pathways associated with developmental process, immunity, growth, and reproduction. Our findings provide a valuable resource for sheep breeding and insight into the mechanisms of artificial selection. Copyright © 2022 by Animal Bioscience.},

	abstract = {Trypanosomiasis is a disease caused by unicellular protozoan parasites. Small ruminants succumb to trypanosomiasis in areas of high tsetse fly challenge, resulting in serious economic loss often to farmers in low-input smallholder systems. At present, trypanosomiasis is treated with trypanocidal drugs, but access to these can be limited, and increasing parasite resistance raises questions about their efficacy. The development of trypanotolerance in small ruminant flocks through targeted breeding strategies is considered a sustainable and economical option for controlling African trypanosomiasis. Recently, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with trypanotolerance traits in sheep have been reported. The results of these studies form the basis for more studies to identify QTLs associated with trypanosomiasis resistance, particularly in African livestock species. For example, signatures of positive selection for trypanotolerance have been identified using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data. However, there are several challenges in performing genetic analyses using data from low-input smallholder systems, including a lack of recorded pedigree and production records and the need for large sample sizes when flock sizes are often fewer than 50 animals. Breeding strategies to improve trypanotolerance should also preserve existing genetic diversity as well as minimize excessive genetic introgression by trypanosusceptible breeds. This review discusses the possibilities of breeding for trypanosome tolerance/resistance in low-input/low-output small ruminant production systems. Potential challenges are outlined, and potential available genetic resources are described as a foundation for future work. © 2022 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.},

We developed a database using the most up-to-date information from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (4958 virus species) and identified 1479 vertebrate virus species and their host ranges. Viral traits and host ranges were then used as predictors in generalized linear mixed models for three host-associated outcomes – confirmed zoonotic, potential zoonotic and disease emergence. We identified significant interactions between host range and viral characteristics, not previously reported, that influence the zoonotic and emergence potential of viruses. Bat- and livestock-adapted viruses posed high risk, and the risk increased substantially if these viruses were also present in other vertebrates or were not reported from invertebrates. Our model predicted 39 viruses of interest that have never been reported to have zoonotic potential (27) or to potentially become emerging human viruses (12). We conclude that nucleic acid type is important in identifying the zoonotic and emerging potential of viruses. We recommend enhanced surveillance and monitoring of these virus species identified with a zoonotic and emerging potential to mitigate disease outbreaks and future epidemics. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Objective. This study aimed to explore the efficacy of preoperative prediction of visceral pleural invasion (VPI) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on enhanced CT radiomics and morphological features before operation. Methods. A total of 220 patients with lung cancer treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College from January 2019 to January 2021 were analyzed retrospectively, including 145 males and 75 females aged 43-89 (62.6±10.0) years old. According to the postoperative pathological examination, 90 cases were diagnosed with VPI, and 130 cases did not have VPI. According to the proportion of 4: 1, the patients were randomly divided into training group (176 cases) and verification group (44 cases). The radiomics features were extracted based on the preoperative enhanced CT images. The LASSO-Logistic regression model was used to select the radiomics features with the highest correlation between arteriovenous phase and venous phase to establish the VPI prediction model. Independent sample t-test and χ2test were used to screen clinical data, CT morphological features, and other related variables, which were combined with the final selection of the most relevant radiomics features to build a joint model. The working characteristic (ROC) curve of the subjects was drawn, and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the prediction efficiency of the model for VPI in the training and verification groups. The Delong test was used to compare the AUC differences between models. Results. Among the 1878 radiomics features extracted, the 10 most relevant radiomics features in the arterial and venous phases were selected and used to establish VPI prediction models. In the training and validation groups, the AUC values of the venous imaging group model were 0.867(95%CI 0.815-0.920) and 0.855(95%CI 0.746-0.964), respectively, which were greater than those of 0.844(95%CI 0.784-0.904) and 0.814(95%CI 0.677-0.951) in the arterial phase, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (Z = 2.20, 2.07, all P values < 0.05). Significant differences were found in three CT morphological features, namely, cavity sign, spiculation sign, and pleural indentation sign, between patients with VPI and those without VPI (χ2= 8.30, 7.87, 10.32, all P values < 0.05). There was no significant difference in baseline data between the training group and the validation group (all P values > 0.05). The combined model was constructed by using the final 10 highest venous phase radiomics features that were correlated and the above three CT morphological signs. The AUCs in the training and validation groups were 0.914(95%CI 0.875-0.953) and 0.884(95%CI 0.785-0.984), respectively, which were greater than those in the venous phase imaging model, and the AUC difference between the two models in the training and validation groups was statistically significant (Z = 3.09, 2.21, all P values < 0.05). The joint model had higher prediction efficiency for VPI. Conclusion. Based on the radiomics features of enhanced CT venous phase images combined with cavity sign, spiculation sign and pleural indentation sign, the joint model of CT morphological signs can predict the occurrence of VPI in patients with non-small cell lung cancer before operation and assist clinical decision-making. © 2022 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

	abstract = {Understanding the genetic status of aquaculture strains is essential for developing management guidelines aimed at sustaining the rates of genetic gain for economically important traits, as well as securing populations that will be robust to climate change. Coho salmon was the first salmonid introduced to Chile for commercial purposes and now comprises an essential component of the country’s aquaculture industry. Several events, such as admixture, genetic bottlenecks, and rapid domestication, appear to be determinants in shaping the genome of commercial strains representing this species. To determine the impact of such events on the genetic diversity of these strains, we sought to estimate the effective population size (Ne) of several of these strains using genome-wide approaches. We compared these estimates to commercial strains from North America and Japan, as well as a hatchery strain used for supportive breeding of wild populations. The estimates of Ne were based on a method robust to assumptions about changes in population history, and ranged from low (Ne = 34) to relatively high (Ne = 80) in the Chilean strains. These estimates were higher than those obtained from the commercial North American strain but lower than those observed in the hatchery population and the Japanese strain (with Ne over 150). Our results suggest that some populations require measures to control the rates of inbreeding, possibly by using genomic information and incorporating new genetic material to ensure the long-term sustainability of these populations. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Porcine Circovirus-like (PCL) virus, a new emerging virus, has been widely detected in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Anhui provinces in China, which may be a novel agent causing severe diarrhea in newborn piglets and tending to spread widely. Evidence suggests that the virus is related to hemorrhagic enteritis and diarrhea, and many newborn piglets were emaciated to death after infection. Therefore, a sensitive, quick, and accurate detection system for virus detection and epidemiological investigation is necessary. In this study, we developed a real-time quantitative PCR assay based on SYBR green for the detection of PCL virus. The ORF4 conserved region of PCL virus was found by the alignment of the uploaded genome sequences to design specific primers, and the primers were tested and showed good specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. Approximately, 138 fecal samples were obtained from diarrheal pigs in South China from June to December 2021. Approximately, 22.46% (31/138) of the samples and 40% (8/20) of the pig farms were positive for PCL virus, respectively, by using this method. Moreover, it is worth noting that the virus was first detected in Hainan and Jiangxi Provinces of China, which means that the virus may spread widely in China. Through evolutionary tree analysis and partial sequence comparison, there are some differences of virus genes in each province, suggesting that there is a risk of variation, and the four PCL virus strains showed a sequence similarity of 86.7%–87.8% for the rep gene and 92.2%–92.9% for the Rep protein, respectively, with Bo-Circo-like virus that is detected in bovine, which further demonstrates a close relationship between the two viruses that originated from different animals. In conclusion, our study provides a useful diagnostic approach to PCL virus detection and epidemiological inquiry. Meanwhile, the epidemic data using this real-time qPCR assay provide evidence for the widespread variations and epidemic of the virus in South China, and warn the appropriate measures for prevention, and control of porcine circovirus-like virus infection should be under consideration in pig production.

	abstract = {In the semi-arid regions of the Algerian highlands, demand for irrigation water has increased due to population growth, and climate change. Irrigation and the selection of durum wheat genotypes play an essential role in the payer economy and require comparative and identification studies of new durum wheat varieties. To understand the current situation, we compared two new durum wheat genotypes with old ones on morphological, biochemical, physiological parameters, and yield components; in addition, we examined the response of the genotypes to the components of water use efficiency. In a pilot farm in a semi-ar-id environment in the Algerian highlands, we compared two new durum wheat genotypes with two pregnancies on different morphological, biochemical, physiological parameters and Statgraphics centurion 18 and JMP Pro 13 test yield components for two-water treatment based on cropwat software, the results obtained. The results show that the new genotypes have similar and sometimes better traits than the old ones. Boutaleb (BT), new genotype it showed better reactions on all the parameters studied, it decreased leaf area for a resistance reaction, higher bio-mass in rainfall as an index of sensitivity to water stress, better yield to present a production trait, as well as Boutaleb (BT) and the variety with the highest water value for both treatments. The new varieties Boutaleb (BT) and Oued el bared (OEB) reveal the existence of a great variability for most of the parameters measured, there are still other parameters to be studied for the well classified in the future. © 2022, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

	abstract = {One of the potential consequences of global climate change is that forage resources may become more limited at certain times of the year. In this study, 340 primiparous Charolais cows from two experimental farms participated in a feed restriction challenge in order to better understand how lactating beef cattle can adapt to this limitation. Therefore, half of the animals were fed 3 forage units (FU) less than their expected needs (around 30% reduction) from 10 days after calving until they were turned out on grass in April (average duration of 85 days). All animals were then kept together until mid-July (recovery period, average duration of 89 days). Regular measurements were taken of dam weight, body condition score (BCS), and calf weight; three estimates were made of dam milk production during lactation; and the date of each cow's resumption of cyclicity was recorded. On one of the farms, the experiment was extended for two more lactations, for a total of 592 lactations among all the animals examined. The effects of dietary restriction were analyzed using generalized linear models of the phenotyped traits. We found that winter feed restriction in early-lactation Charolais cows affected all traits, with generally similar impacts on the mobilization of body reserves and limitation of milk production. At the end of the winter period, diet-restricted dams were an average of 55 kg lighter than their unrestricted counterparts (corresponding to 0.66 standard deviations, s.d.) and had BCS values that were 0.81 points lower (0.55 s.d.). Similarly, calves from restricted dams were also lighter (20 kg difference, corresponding to 0.68 s.d.), reflecting the reduced milk production of their mothers (-1.7 L at 90 days in milk, corresponding to 0.77 s.d.). On average, feed-restricted primiparous cows resumed cyclicity almost an entire cycle later than their control counterparts (difference of 17 days, corresponding to 0.48 s.d.). For cow traits, the differences between groups remained significant but decreased in magnitude as spring went on, especially for milk production; by the start of the next calving period, the effects of restriction were no longer visible. For calves, however, the differences in weight between groups remained steady, suggesting that the feed restriction occurred too early in their lives for them to be able to experience compensatory growth at refeeding. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Climate change and rising global temperature are expected to exacerbate further the problem of heat stress which is very well known to affect livestock production, reproduction, and welfare negatively. Despite the tremendous advances in strategies to alleviate the impact of heat stress on livestock production, heat stress remains a substantial challenge for sustainability of global livestock production causing substantial economic losses to livestock industries in the warmer parts of the world. Physical modification of the environment, nutritional interventions, and genetic selection for heat tolerance are strategies that could be used to attenuate some of the negative impacts of heat stress. While genetic selection for heat tolerance would be the best long-term strategy to produce heat resilient future animals, identification of heat-tolerant animals is a big challenge due to the negative association between production traits and heat tolerance. Due to this unfavorable correlation between production traits and heat tolerance, a sustained reduction in heat tolerance has occurred due to continuous selection for increased production over the last 50 years. More work is thus needed to find phenotypes that are more convenient and economically viable to measure and identify heat-tolerant animals under farm conditions. Similarly, more advancements and cost reduction in data collection and genotyping are needed to develop genomic breeding values for heat tolerance. Genomic selection for heat tolerance in high-producing dairy cattle breeds such as Holsteins and Jerseys may be useful for the developed nations with more advanced data collection, efficient management systems, and genomic technologies. However, less developed countries with adapted local breeds may have better crossbreeding options between local stock and high producing exotic breeds. Nevertheless, selection for heat tolerance will improve the heat resilience of future animals and play an important role in supporting sustainable livestock production under changing climates. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

	abstract = {The subtropical climatic conditions in the winter season characterized by low temperature may enable to induce cold stress in pregnancy and transition periods which results in the production of reactive oxygen species. However, flavonoid enriched impact on pregnancy and lactation of Beetal goats remains unclear in a subtropical cold environment. Forty-eight multiparous pregnant Beetal goats were randomly assigned into two groups, mid-pregnancy (n = 24), late pregnancy to early lactation (n = 24). Mid-pregnancy and late pregnancy were further sub-grouped into control and supplemented with an equal number of animals. Both groups of animals were offered concentrates while the supplemented group was provided additional flavonoid-rich supplementation (Loxidan) at 120 mg/kg/head during the experimental period of 45 days in each phase of pregnancy plus 33 days of kids suckling period only in late pregnancy to early lactation group. Fractional biochemical analysis of Loxidan feed revealed it contained a rich source of total flavonoids (8268 ± 92.1 μg/g) with total antioxidant capacity (14.6 ± 1.7 μM/g DW). Blood was collected fifteen days apart during mid-pregnancy (60 to 105 days) and late pregnancy plus early lactation (120 to 165 days) for the assessment of serum biochemical parameters. Results revealed that serum profile of total flavonoids, total antioxidant activity, total oxidant status, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, total phenolic, total proteins, and progesterone level showed significant values as compared to the control group in both phases of pregnancy (P < 0.05). Moreover, flavonoid enriched supplementation increased the initial kid's weight and total average weight gain as compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Overall, results illustrate that supplementation increased kid's birth weight, average daily weight gain, and fetal survival. Therefore, flavonoids could be used as an antioxidant regimen to mitigate cold stress of subtropical environment on pregnancy and lactation to improve reproductive traits. © 2022},

	abstract = {Sheep farming in Greece is focused on milk production. Meat is considered a by-product and consists mainly light carcasses of undefined quality. The main challenge of the sector is to ensure sustainability, and hence efforts are towards efficient use of available resources, including undervalued carcasses of local fat-tailed sheep. The objective here was twofold: (i) to assess the carcass quality of fat-tailed sheep slaughtered at different live weights and (ii) to compare them with carcasses from thin-tailed sheep. In total, 146 fat-tailed and 97 thin-tailed dairy sheep were used. They belonged to five live-weight categories (LWC), representing 25%, 35%, 50%, 70% and 100% of mature body weight. Carcass length/weight/yield/pH and wither height were recorded. Muscle fiber minimum Feret’s diameter and meat color/tenderness/moisture/lipid and protein content were determined. Sex and LWC differences in fat-tailed sheep were assessed. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to compare with thin-tailed sheep, considering the effects of LWC, sex and their interactions with sheep population (fat-tailed/thin-tailed). Most traits were significantly different (p < 0.05) between groups of fat-tailed sheep. Carcass yield of fat-tailed sheep was significantly higher compared to thin-tailed (p < 0.01). Interactions of sheep population with LWC or sex affected wither height, carcass pH, meat color and tenderness (p < 0.05). Fat-tailed sheep meat quality is equal or higher compared to thin-tailed. Finishing weights corresponding to 50 and 70% LWC may improve capitalization of fat-tailed carcasses. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Productivity and profitability of sheep farming are strongly influenced by the productive performance of ewe during it lifetime. For that, it is relevant to quantify the genetic and non-genetic factors affecting functional longevity in order to consider its inclusion as a trait in a breeding scheme. In this investigation, a Weibull proportional hazard model was applied to study the length of productive live as functional longevity indicator in Latxa dairy sheep breeds. The time from the first calving to the date of culling was individually calculated using records from 28,466 Latxa Cara Rubia (LCR), 26,045 Latxa Cara Negra from Euskadi (LCNEAE) and 10,385 Latxa Cara Negra from Navarre (LCNNAF) from commercial flocks, born between 2000 and 2018. The culling risk associated to the age at first lambing, number of lambs born per lambing and total milk yield produced per lactation was estimated using a likelihood ratio test, and the genetic component of longevity was estimated using a sire-maternal grandsire model. The results concerning the relative culling risk showed that ewes having their first lambing at 2 years of age had around 1.30 times more risk of disposal compared with those of 1 year, regardless of the Latxa population. Similarly, it was found that LCR and LCNEAE having 2 o 3 lambs born per lambing had 1.20 and 1.34 higher risk to be culled in comparison to having 1 lamb, whereas the risk was 1.04 in LCNNAF. In contrast, the probability to be culled was drastically reduced by around 1.50 in all the Latxa populations as the milk yield moved from low to intermediate levels and by around 3.0 times when it moved from low to high. Regarding the genetic parameters of longevity, heritability values ranged from 0.042 to 0.061, which indicates that it is under low additive genetic control. Furthermore, a decreasing genetic was observed, although the decrease rate was smaller during recent years possibly due to the parallel improvement on udder traits. In the light of the results of this first longevity study in Latxa, it is possible to infer that ewes’ on-herd durability is negatively affected by a reproductive delay and a high prolificacy, whereas the higher the milk production, the lower the risk. Moreover, given the genetic findings, it can also be deduced that although selection on longevity is viable, the genetic progress may be a long process. © 2022},

This warrants research efforts to screen the available breeds to identify climate resilient breeds. Further, comparing the crossbred animals with indigenous breeds can help to understand the real differences in livestock adaption in addition to identifying quantifiable biomarkers covering productive and adaptive traits. This chapter is an attempt to project to the readers the differences in adaptation between crossbreds and indigenous cattle. Indigenous cattle possess various unique characteristics which imparts them the potential to survive in tropical climate. However, the crossbred cattle which are well known for their production struggles in harsh climatic condition which ultimately culminates in reduced production and welfare. Crossbred cattle shows higher physiological and biochemical reactions, as well as a lower total antioxidant capacity, as compared to native breeds, indicating that they were more susceptible to heat stress. Further, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 which is considered as potential markers for temperature adaptation in livestock was highly expressed in less adapted crossbred than indigenous breed. More such efforts are needed to identify more thermo-tolerant breeds to propagate them in specific agro-ecological zones. Such efforts can ensure the livelihood of poor and marginal farmers in the changing climate scenario. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

An ANOVA model was applied to the six components to investigate the effects of the province, investment levels, grazing type, milk production, and profitability. Differences in milk productivity, roughage management, concentrate supply, and fodder management were significant according to the province and grazing type, which indicated a difference in intensification levels among the cities. Economic efficiency and dual-purpose farming differed significantly for milk production levels as well as milk productivity, and economic efficiency differed for profitability levels. We found a tendency regarding the impact of roughage management on profitability.

	abstract = {Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a heterogeneous group of disorders, of which many have the potential to lead to progressive pulmonary fibrosis. A distinction is usually made between primarily inflammatory ILD and primarily fibrotic ILD. As recent studies show that anti-fibrotic drugs can be beneficial in patients with primarily inflammatory ILD that is characterized by progressive pulmonary fibrosis, treatment decisions have become more complicated. In this perspective, we propose that the ‘treatable trait’ concept, which is based on the recognition of relevant exposures, various treatable phenotypes (disease manifestations) or endotypes (shared molecular mechanisms) within a group of diseases, can be applied to progressive pulmonary fibrosis. These targets for medical intervention can be identified through validated biomarkers and are not necessarily related to specific diagnostic labels. Proposed treatable traits are: cigarette smoking, occupational, allergen or drug exposures, excessive (profibrotic) auto- or alloimmunity, progressive pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, tuberculosis, exercise intolerance, exertional hypoxia, and anxiety and depression. There are also several potential traits that have not been associated with relevant outcomes or for which no effective treatment is available at present: air pollution, mechanical stress, viral infections, bacterial burden in the lungs, surfactant-related pulmonary fibrosis, telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis, the rs35705950 MUC5B promoter polymorphism, acute exacerbations, gastro-esophageal reflux, dyspnea, and nocturnal hypoxia. The ‘treatable traits’ concept can be applied in new clinical trials for patients with progressive pulmonary fibrosis and could be used for developing new treatment strategies. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Variations in Cytokine inducible SH2-containing protein (CISH) gene influence human susceptibility to common infectious diseases, but little is known about CISH in swine. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine porcine CISH (pCISH) mRNA expression level in different tissues of piglets, 2) predict putative functional genetic variations within pCISH, 3) investigate the association between a identified variation in the 3’UTR and piglets phenotype traits in Min (n = 226) and Landrace (n = 186) population, and explore the function of this variation. Results of quantitative PCR showed pCISH mRNA expressed in all the collected tissues with higher level in lung and ileum than colon (p < 0.05). In-silico analysis indicated none of the functional ns-SNPs existed in pCISH coding region. Results from the characterizing of 3’UTR presented a novel 12-bp insertion/deletion (indel) mutation. Statistical analysis demonstrated that this 12-bp indel associated with piglets diarrhea score in the Landrace population, and animals with AA genotype (12-bp insertion) presented lower diarrhea score when compared with BB (p < 0.05) or AB (p < 0.01) carriers. The in vitro study indicated that the luciferase activity of reconstruct plasmid psiCHECK-2-CISH-AA or psiCHECK-2-CISH-BB was significantly lower than the negative control (p < 0.05), and luciferase activity of psiCHECK-2-CISH-AA was higher than that of the psiCHECK-2-CISH-BB (p < 0.05). Although results herein suggested the 12-bp indel might affect Landrace piglet susceptibility to diarrhea, further association studies in more populations are needed before this preliminary finding could be used for pig breeding. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Environmental stresses, including the salt and heavy metals contaminated sites, signify a threat to sustainable crop production. The existence of these stresses has increased in recent years due to human-induced climate change. In view of this, several remediation strategies including nanotechnology have been studied to find more effective approaches for sustaining the environment. Nanoparticles, due to unique physiochemical properties; i.e. high mobility, reactivity, high surface area, and particle morphology, have shown a promising solution to promote sustainable agriculture. Crop plants easily take up nanoparticles, which can penetrate into the cells to play essential roles in growth and metabolic events. In addition, different iron- and carbon-based nanocompositions enhance the removal of metals from the contaminated sites and water; these nanoparticles activate the functional groups that potentially target specific molecules of the metal pollutants to obtain efficient remediation. This review article emphasises the recent advancement in the application of nanotechnology for the remediation of contaminated soils with metal pollutants and mitigating different abiotic stresses. Different implementation barriers are also discussed. Furthermore, we reported the opportunities and research directions to promote sustainable development based on the application of nanotechnology.  © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

	abstract = {In solid tumours, cancer cells that undergo epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) express characteristic gene expression signatures that promote invasive migration as well as the development of stemness, immunosuppression and drug/radiotherapy resistance, contributing to the formation of currently untreatable metastatic tumours. The cancer traits associated with EMT can be controlled by the signalling nodes at characteristic adhesion sites (focal contacts, invadopodia and microtentacles) where the regulation of cell migration, cell cycle progression and pro-survival signalling converge. In haematological tumours, ample evidence accumulated during the last decade indicates that the development of an EMT-like phenotype is indicative of poor disease prognosis. However, this EMT phenotype has not been directly linked to the assembly of specific forms of adhesions. In the current review we discuss the role of EMT in haematological malignancies and examine its possible link with the progression towards more invasive and aggressive forms of these tumours. We also review the known types of adhesions formed by haematological malignancies and speculate on their possible connection with the EMT phenotype. We postulate that understanding the architecture and regulation of EMT-related adhesions will lead to the discovery of new therapeutic interventions to overcome disease progression and resistance to therapies. © 2022 by the authors.

We analysed direct (DCE) and maternal (MCE) calving ease, direct (DSB) and maternal (MSB) stillbirth, milking speed (MSP), and temperament (TEM) based on a Holstein-Friesian dairy cattle population consisting of 35,203 individuals. The number of animals, depending on the trait, ranged from 22,301 bulls for TEM to 30,603 for DCE. We estimated the SNP effects (based on 46,216 polymorphisms from Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip Version 2) using a multi-SNP mixed model. The SNP positions were mapped to genes and the GO terms/KEGG pathways of the corresponding genes were assigned. The estimation of the GO term/KEGG pathway effects was based on a mixed model using the SNP effects as dependent variables. The number of significant SNPs comprised 59 for DCE, 25 for DSB and MSP, 17 for MCE and MSB, and 7 for TEM. Significant KEGG pathways were found for MSB (2), TEM (2), and MSP (1) and 11 GO terms were significant for MSP, 10 for DCE, 8 for DSB and TEM, 5 for MCE, and 3 for MSB. From the perspective of a better understanding of the genomic background of the phenotypes, traits with low heritabilities suggest that the focus should be moved from single genes to the metabolic pathways or gene ontologies significant for the phenotype. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) has been considered a promising new flatfish species for Mediterranean marine fish farming. Accurate prediction of fillet traits in live animals may allow for more efficient control of muscle deposition in fish. In this sense, this study was undertaken to develop a non-invasive method to predict in vivo fish fillet volume and yield using real-time ultrasonography (RTU). The trial was conducted with 44 market weight Senegalese sole (298.54 ± 87.30 g). Fish were scanned with an Aloka SSD 500V with a 7.5 MHz probe. Ten RTU cross-sectional images were taken from the operculum to the caudal fin at regular intervals. These images were analyzed using Fiji software. These data were then used to estimate the partial volumes of the fillet. Actual fillet volume was determined using Archimedes’ principle. Simple and stepwise multiple regression analyses were then used to develop prediction models of fillet volume and yield. The most cranial RTU sections of the fish fillet were the best single predictors of both fillet volume and fillet yield and were the ones included in the best stepwise models. The best RTU slice area explained 82% of the variation observed in fillet volume, but the other RTU slice areas used as predictors of fillet volume showed poor to moderate accuracy (0.035 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.615). Single RTU partial volumes showed poor to very high accuracy (0.395 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.970) as predictors of fillet volume. The best stepwise model based on the RTU slice areas included three independent variables and explained 88.3% of the observed variation. The best stepwise models based on RTU partial volumes (single volumes and/or combinations of single volumes) explained about 97% of the variation observed in fillet volume. Two RTU volume traits, V1–5 + V6–9, and V1+()+9, showed to be practically direct predictors of the actual fillet volume, explaining, respectively, 97% and 96% of the variation observed in the actual fillet volume. The fillet yields show lower correlations with slice areas (r between 0.044 and 0.601) than with volumes (r between 0.288 and 0.637). While further studies are clearly necessary to better understand the potential of RTU for the estimation of fillet yield in fish in general and Senegalese sole in particular, the present results showed that RTU traits can be very good predictors of Senegalese sole’s fillet volume, either used in regression models or as direct predictors. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an emerging tick-borne human disease in Spain. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics and exposure risk determinants of CCHF virus (CCHFV) in animal models is essential to predict the time and areas of highest transmission risk. With this goal, we designed a longitudinal survey of two wild ungulate species, the red deer (Cervus elaphus) and the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), in Doñana National Park, a protected Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot with high ungulate and CCHFV vector abundance, and which is also one of the main stopover sites for migratory birds between Africa and western Europe. Both ungulates are hosts to the principal CCHFV vector in Spain, Hyalomma lusitanicum. We sampled wild ungulates annually from 2005 to 2020 and analysed the frequency of exposure to CCHFV by a double-antigen ELISA. The annual exposure risk was modelled as a function of environmental traits in an approach to understanding exposure risk determinants that allow us to predict the most likely places and years for CCHFV transmission. The main findings show that H. lusitanicum abundance is a fundamental driver of the fine-scale spatial CCHFV transmission risk, while inter-annual risk variation is conditioned by virus/vector hosts, host community structure and weather variations. The most relevant conclusion of the study is that the emergence of CCHF in Spain might be associated with recent wild ungulate population changes promoting higher vector abundance. This work provides relevant insights into the transmission dynamics of CCHFV in enzootic scenarios that would allow deepening the understanding of the ecology of CCHFV and its major determinants. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Thailand is a tropical country affected by global climate change and has high temperatures and humidity that cause heat stress in livestock. A temperature–humidity index (THI) is required to assess and evaluate heat stress levels in livestock. One of the livestock types in Thailand experi-encing heat stress due to extreme climate change is crossbred dairy cattle. Genetic evaluations of heat tolerance in dairy cattle have been carried out for reproductive traits. Heritability values for reproductive traits are generally low (<0.10) because environmental factors heavily influence them. Consequently, genetic improvement for these traits would be slow compared to production traits. Positive and negative genetic correlations were found between reproductive traits and reproductive traits and yield traits. Several selection methods for reproductive traits have been introduced, i.e., the traditional method, marker-assisted selection (MAS), and genomic selection (GS). GS is the most promising technique and provides accurate results with a high genetic gain. Single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) has higher accuracy than the multi-step equivalent for fertility traits or low-her-itability traits. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Previous studies and efforts to prevent and manage avian influenza (AI) outbreaks have mainly focused on the wintering season. However, outbreaks of AI have been reported in the summer, including the breeding season of waterfowl. Additionally, the spatial distribution of waterfowl can easily change during the annual cycle due to their life-cycle traits and the presence of both migrants and residents in the population. Thus, we assessed the spatiotemporal variation in AI exposure risk in poultry due to spatial distribution changes in three duck species included in both major residents and wintering migrants in South Korea, the mandarin, mallard and spot-billed duck, during wintering (October–March), breeding (April–June) and whole annual seasons. To estimate seasonal ecological niche variations among the three duck species, we applied pairwise ecological niche analysis using the Pianka index. Subsequently, seasonal distribution models were projected by overlaying the monthly ranges estimated by the maximum entropy model. Finally, we overlaid each seasonal distribution range onto a poultry distribution map of South Korea. We found that the mandarin had less niche overlap with the mallard and spot-billed duck during the wintering season than during the breeding season, whereas the mallard had less niche overlap with the mandarin and spot-billed duck during the breeding season than during the wintering season. Breeding and annual distribution ranges of the mandarin and spot-billed duck, but not the mallard, were similar or even wider than their wintering ranges. Similarly, the mandarin and spot-billed duck showed more extensive overlap proportions between poultry and their distributional ranges during both the breeding and annual seasons than during the wintering season. These results suggest that potential AI exposure in poultry can occur more widely in the summer than in winter, depending on sympatry with the host duck species. Future studies considering the population density and variable pathogenicity of AI are required. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Many animals are highly mobile and have evolved long-distance migrations that make them actors in multiple ecosystems through the year and throughout their life. Most long-distance migrations are adaptations to seasonality and more generally to spatio-temporal patterns in food availability, weather, risk of parasite and pathogen infections, and predation risk. Due to the considerable seasonality in high-latitude environments, with Arctic as extremes, long-distance seasonal migrations are a distinct characteristic of the fauna in these Northern regions. The Arctic is also a seasonal melting pot during the productive summer, when large numbers of organism move in from all over the world. Travelling animals connect ecosystems and serve as spatial vectors, of energy and nutrients and of other organisms that follow (sometimes as active hitchhikers) for parts or the entire route. We provide an overview of central concepts and main spatial and temporal (phenology) patterns of animal migrations, with a focus on migrations to and from as well as within northern regions (i.e. arctic and sub-arctic regions). In particular, we characterize the role of migratory animals as vectors and hosts for infectious agents, and we discuss the concepts of migratory escape, migratory culling, and migratory separation. Understanding drivers and patterns of migrations is essential for understanding the dynamics of diseases and must therefore be considered in veterinary and human medicine and the One Health perspective. We show how climate change and human stressors impact migrations and how these changes may interact with the animals’ capacity to transport parasites and other infectious agents. Throughout, we stress the evolutionary ecology of migrations, a plastic trait under natural selection with complex ecological consequences. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer now outnumber all other health ailments in humans globally due to abrupt changes in lifestyle following the industrial revolution. The industrial revolution has also intensified livestock farming, resulting in an increased demand for productivity and stressed animals. The livestock industry faces significant challenges from a projected sharp increase in global food and high animal protein demand. Nutrition genomics holds great promise for the future as its advances have opened up a whole new world of disease understanding and prevention. Nutrigenomics is the study of the interactions between genes and diet. It investigates molecular relationships between nutrients and genes to identify how even minor modifications could potentially alter animal and human health/performance by using techniques like proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. Dietary modifications mostly studied in livestock focus mainly on health and production traits through protein, fat, mineral, and vitamin supplementation changes. Nutrigenomics meticulously selects nutrients for fine-tuning the expression of genes that match animal/human genotypes for better health, productivity, and the environment. As a step forward, nutrigenomics integrates nutrition, molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, molecular medicine, and epidemiology to better understand the role of food as an epigenetic factor in the occurrence of these diseases. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts, latest advances, and studies in the field of nutrigenomics, emphasizing the interaction of diet with gene expression, and how it relates to human and animal health along with its human-animal interphase. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {As a natural alternative to traditional antimicrobials, phages are being recognised as highly effective control agents for Salmonella and other foodborne bacteria. Due to the high diversity of Salmonella serotypes and the emergence of phage-resistant strains, attempting to isolate more widespread, strictly lytic Salmonella phages is highly warranted. In this study, a lytic phage, LP31, was isolated from poultry faecal samples. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the phage had a polyhedral head and a retraction-free tail, indicative of the Siphoviridae family. Adsorption rate experiments showed that LP31 required the participation of lipopolysaccharides, but not flagella, during phage adsorption. Host profile identification showed that LP31 could lyse most Salmonella Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) (96.15%, N = 104) and Salmonella Pullorum (S. Pullorum) (96.67%, N = 60). Initial applications found that LP31 reduced the concentration of static S. Enteritidis on metal surfaces (0.951 log10 cfu/ml) and in the faeces of chicks (2.14 log10 cfu/g). Notably, LP31 could almost completely remove biofilms formed by S. Enteritidis and S. Pullorum in 1 h. These findings suggest that LP31 has a good prevention and control effect against biofilms and planktonic antibiotic-resistant Salmonella, and is therefore a potentially promising biocontrol agent for controlling the spread of Salmonella in the poultry and food processing industries. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Three muscle cuts (striploin—m. longissimus dorsi et thoracis; bolar blade—m. triceps brachii caput longum; internal flank plate—m. obliquus internus abdominis) were used for consumer eating quality testing and striploin was used for panelist eating quality assessment, and objective measurements [Warner–Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and fatty acid (FA) and antioxidant contents]. Results indicated that the farming system had no impact on carcass characteristics or meat quality, but it tended to affect FA content, which is likely explained by between-system differences in animal maturity (assessed by ossification score). Animal gender had significant effects on three eating quality traits evaluated by untrained consumers, with higher flavor liking, overall liking, and overall meat eating quality (MQ4) scores in females than in males. Additionally, FA contents were correlated with sensory quality traits to varying extents: consumer-scored tenderness, flavor, and overall liking were mainly positively correlated with ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents, and panelist-evaluated tenderness and abnormal flavor were more positively correlated with total lipids, saturated fatty acid (SFA), and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) contents. Overall, this study showed that specific grass-fed crossbred Angus x Salers cattle can produce lean meat rich in ω-3 PUFAs with a low ω-6/ω-3 ratio and with “better than average” beef eating quality. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Chickpea is a pulse crop that is rich in proteins and helps in fulfilling the requirement of protein for vegetarian people thus yield maximization needed. This study aimed to determine the effects of spacing, nitrogen rates, and their interactive effects on the growth and productivity of the selected chickpea varieties. Field experiments were conducted at Mwea, Kenya between 2017 and 2018 involving four varieties (Saina K, Mwanza 2, Chaina I and Chaina III) at a spacing of 50x10cm, 50x20cm, and 50x30cm, and starter nitrogen-fertilizer application rates 0kg, 30kg, 60kg, and 90kg ha-1. A split-split plot design arranged in a 4x3x4 layout was used in the current study. Data related to plant height, biomass, grain yield, and harvest index were collected and subjected to statistical analysis by GLM in SAS 9.4 computer software. Variations occurred in measured traits like the height of crops (34.81-38.00cm), biomass yield (3.31-8.08t ha-1), seed yield (0.14 to 1.9t ha-1), and percent harvest index (5-45%) was reported. Mwanza 2 expressed the highest plant height, biomass, and grain yield. The highest plant biomass was obtained under 50x10cm spacing, while the highest grain yield weight was reported under 50x30cm spacing x 60kg N ha-1. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the highest enhanced growth and productivity of chickpea were realized at interactions of Mwanza 2x50x10cmx90kg ha-1 nitrogen rate in the study area. © 2022, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

	abstract = {Abortion in dairy cattle causes great economic losses due to reduced animal health, increase in culling rates, reduction in calf production, and milk yield, among others. Although the etiology of abortions can be of various origins, previous research has shown a genetic component. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe the development of the genomic prediction for cow abortions in lactating Holstein dairy cattle based on producer-recorded data and ssGBLUP methodology and (2) evaluate the efficacy of genomic predictions for cow abortions in commercial herds of US Holstein cows using data from herds that do not contribute phenotypic information to the evaluation. We hypothesized that cows with greater genomic predictions for cow abortions (Z_Abort STA) would have a reduced incidence of abortion. Phenotypic data on abortions, pedigree, and genotypes were collected directly from commercial dairy producers upon obtaining their permission. Abortion was defined as the loss of a confirmed pregnancy after 42 and prior to 260 days of gestation, treated as a binary outcome (0, 1), and analyzed using a threshold model. Data from a different subset of animals were used to test the efficacy of the prediction. The additive genetic variance for the cow abortion trait (Z_Abort) was 0.1235 and heritability was 0.0773. For all animals with genotypes (n = 1,662,251), mean reliability was 42%, and genomic predicted transmitting abilities (gPTAs) ranged from −8.8 to 12.4. Z_Abort had a positive correlation with cow and calf health traits and reproductive traits, and a negative correlation with production traits. Z_Abort effectively identified cows with a greater or lesser risk of abortion (16.6% vs. 11.0% for the worst and best genomics groups, respectively; p < 0.0001). The inclusion of cow abortion genomic predictions in a multi-trait selection index would allow dairy producers and consultants to reduce the incidence of abortion and to select high-producing, healthier, and more profitable cows. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this study, we evaluated the impact of two planting positions of cassava cuttings, cv. ‘Vassourinha’, combined with different times and doses of nitrogen application, on productivity and other agronomic traits. In the experiment, the treatment was completely randomized using a 2 × 3 × 4 factorial scheme with two positions of the cuttings [horizontal (PH) and vertical (PV)], three instances of N application (45, 90, and 135 days after planting), and four doses of N (0, 80, 160, and 240 kg ha–1), with six repetitions. We recorded and evaluated the plant height, number of shoots, stem diameter, biomass of the aerial part, number of commercial roots, the total production, and the collection index. The addition of 240 kg ha–1 N and PH increased plant height and stem diameter but did not affect the number of commercial roots, total production, or the collection index. The treatment involving the addition of nitrogen fertilizer 135 days after planting with 240 kg ha–1 N and planting in the PV provided the highest amount of shoot biomass without influencing crop productivity. © 2022, Federal University of Lavras.

	abstract = {Chitin and chitosan are well-known natural polymers that have been considered a sustainable feedstock for the production of high-value biomaterials. In particular, the wide availability of the main sources of chitin, e.g., squid pens, shrimp, crab shells, insects, and fungal cell walls, is associated to different methodologies for its extraction, namely, classical methods based on strong acids, alkali, and enzymes, or alternative ones like the use of ionic liquids and/or natural deep eutectic solvents. The latter method offers opportunities to extract and process chitin directly from the raw materials, preserving the chitin qualities. The global market of chitin is continuously increasing across different fields, namely, the textile industry, packaging, technology, and biomedical field. In the biomedical field, many chitin and chitosan-based matrices, namely, membranes, hydrogels, nano/microfibers, and scaffolds have been produced using various methodologies such as blending chitin and chitosan with other natural/synthetic polymers (such as alginate, gelatin, polycaprolactone), metals and/or ceramics (such as HAp, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2). Besides, the functional groups of chitin and chitosan can be modified for the development of a broad range of derivatives with a wide range of applications. The achieved architectures have the suitable physicochemical and biological performance for applications in wound repair, bone regeneration, cartilage repair, and infectious diseases. In this chapter is performed an overview of the recent research on the extraction, production, and applications of chitin and chitosan-based matrices envisaging their biomedical potential. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

These species orginated from the Fertile Cresent between 12,000 and 10,000 BP before migrating into surrounding continents. In view of limited information on the reproductive status of indigenous breeds, it is important to examine their semen characteristics in order to select males to improve livestock production. We have largely relied on existing literature but also our published and ongoing research on sperm quality assessment of several indigenous breeds. The sperm quality of these breeds is similar to current commercial breeds and has been quantified using cutting-edge methods. In this context, we have presented sperm functional tests which provide a better estimate of semen quality than just a standard semen analysis. Initial results suggest that the indigenous breeds have a high sperm quality and sperm functionality similar to currently farmed exotic or crossbreeds. In the long-term, the importance of preserving the favorable traits of these breeds is a priority in view of crossbreeding with existing good meat and milk producers. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Some reef-building corals form symbioses with multiple algal partners that differ in ecologically important traits like heat tolerance. Coral bleaching and recovery can drive symbiont community turnover toward more heat-tolerant partners, and this 'adaptive bleaching' response can increase future bleaching thresholds by 1-2°C, aiding survival in warming oceans. However, this mechanism of rapid acclimatization only occurs in corals that are compatible with multiple symbionts, and only when the disturbance regime and competitive dynamics among symbionts are sufficient to bring about community turnover. The full scope of coral taxa and ecological scenarios in which symbiont shuffling occurs remains poorly understood, though its prevalence is likely to increase as warming oceans boost the competitive advantage of heat-tolerant symbionts, increase the frequency of bleaching events, and strengthen metacommunity feedbacks. Still, the constraints, limitations, and potential tradeoffs of symbiont shuffling suggest it will not save coral reef ecosystems; however, it may significantly improve the survival trajectories of some, or perhaps many, coral species. Interventions to manipulate coral symbionts and symbiont communities may expand the scope of their adaptive potential, which may boost coral survival until climate change is addressed.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Fodder beet is a valuable source of fodder in livestock diets due to favorable agronomic characteristics such as resistance to salinity and drought, less water requirement, and proper nutritional characteristics such as forage production and silage with high nutritional value, good taste, and good resistance to environmental changes. Despite the long history of using fodder beet in animal rations, its nutritional issues and physicochemical properties of it are not fully understood and further research is needed. Silage of fodder beet can be used well in the diet of all ruminants, but studying the proper ways of silage and controlling the physical and chemical properties of silage is one of the important issues that should be addressed. In addition to the stated benefits for fodder beet, such as low dry matter content, fiber, and fat, disruption of ion exchange and change in silo buffering capacity, as well as the difficulty of processing it for permanent consumption of livestock and also important restrictions such as high sugar and moisture in the roots and excess leachate and lack of production of quality silage are the most important obstacles to the consumption of this silage. Harvest time of fodder beet coincides with the heat of the summer season and the occurrence of numerous problems, so it is necessary to silo it to prevent spoilage with the correct method. Today with the introduction of new improved cultivars and the growth of processing technology, these limitations have been almost removed. This study aimed to evaluate some of the physicochemical parameters of ensiled fodder beet with and without Lactobacillus buchneri as a microbial additive. Materials and methods: Some physicochemical parameters of ensiled fodder beet with and without Lactobacillus buchneri as a microbial additive in combination with 10 and 15% dry beet pulp were investigated through a 3×2 factorial arrangement in four replicates. Different silages included: 1) 100% pure fodder beet without additive (control), 2) control + 10% dry beet pulp, and 3) control + 15% dry beet pulp. The microbial additive was added at the level of 6×1010 CFU/g of dry matter. 24 plastic bags containing 25 kg of different material were compacted, sealed, and stored at room temperature. After 75 days, four bags of each group were opened and pH, temperature, and quality were immediately determined. Also, a sample from each bag was used to measure the chemical compositions. Measurements of temperature and pH were performed. Two samples of silage, one for extraction and determination of ammonia nitrogen (using selective ion absorption electrode) by AFIA recommendations and the other sample for measurement of dry matter, crude protein, and ash according to the AOAC method were used. Measurement of NDF and ADF were done according to the Van Soest method. To evaluate the aerobic stability of silages when opening plastic bags, the characteristics of color, odor, and texture of silage in the range of 1 to 10 for high to poor quality were determined using the modified Konigsberg Scores method. Data were analyzed using a completely randomized design in a 3×2 factorial arrangement in four replicates using the mixed model procedure of the SAS program. Results and discussion: Experimental groups with 10 and 15% of dry beet pulp with microbial additive had a better quality (score: 6.5±0.16 vs. 9.4±0.21; pH: 4.04±0.06 vs. 4.59±0.08) than the control group (P<0.01). The type of ensiled materials had a significant effect on chemical compositions (DM, CP, NDF, and ADF) and the aerobic stability of silages at opening time (P<0.01). But microbial additives almost had no significant effect on the traits. Watery loss of silage for the control group was higher and its quality was lower than that in other groups (P<0.01). The best quality and more stability of silage were observed in the group with fodder beet+15% of dry beet pulp which is advisable. Conclusions: According to the results of this study, adding 10 and 15% of dry beet pulp to fodder beet silage improved the appearance and aerobic stability of the resulting silages compared to the control group. Evaluation of appearance traits and pH of the samples showed that the treatments with dry pulp and the microbial additive had better quality than the control group. The type of mixture used had a significant effect on the chemical composition of silage and its aerobic stability when opened, but the microbial additive did not show a significant effect in most cases. The watery loss in the control group was higher than the other treatments and had a worse appearance quality than other silages. Overall, the most suitable silage composition in this experiment was a mixture of the control group+15% sugar beet pulp, which had better appearance quality, longer shelf life, higher dry matter level, and lower ammonia nitrogen than the other two groups. © 2022, University of Guilan.

Thus, this study aimed to assess the use of thermolysis pathways by buffaloes reared in a hot and humid environment so as to understand the relationships between environment, skin morphological characteristics, and heat storage, as well as the intensity and proportionality of use of its ways of dissipating heat to maintain homeothermy. The heat tolerance test, associated with the evaluations via infrared thermography, was applied to 10 female Murrah buffaloes and tegument histomorphometry was carried out. The animals exhibited very high heat tolerance with an average of 9.66 ± 0.21 and used thermal polypnea as the main heat dissipation pathway. Their mean skin thickness was 6.03 ± 1.16 mm and the active sweat and sebaceous gland tissue were 1.57 ± 0.38% and 1.08 ± 0.39%, respectively. The buffaloes exhibited a positive correlation between eyeball temperature and internal body temperature (r = 0.84523, p < 0.0001) and a negative correlation between respiratory rate and skin thickness (r = −0.73371, p = 0.0157). The high thermolytic capacity in shade conditions confirms the importance of access to shade in buffalo rearing systems in tropical regions.

In northern Australia, the beef production system is largely extensive and relies heavily on tropical cattle grazing low quality, phosphorus-deficient pastures with seasonal variations in nutritive value. The existing feedlots are predominantly grain-based; providing high-energy rations, faster turn-off and finishing of backgrounded cattle to meet market specifications. This review focusses on the beef cattle production cycle components of maternal nutrition, foetal development, bull fertility, post-natal to weaning, backgrounding, feedlotting, rumen microbes and carcass quality as influenced by genetics and nutrition. This student-driven review identified the following knowledge gaps in the published literature on northern Australian beef cattle production cycle: 1. Long-term benefits and effects of maternal supplementation to alter foetal enzymes on the performance and productivity of beef cattle; 2. Exogenous fibrolytic enzymes to increase nutrient availability from the cell wall and better utilisation of fibrous and phosphorus deficient pasture feedbase during backgrounding; 3. Supplementation with novel encapsulated calcium butyrate and probiotics to stimulate the early development of rumen papillae and enhance early weaning of calves; 4. The use of single nucleotide polymorphisms as genetic markers for the early selection of tropical beef cattle for carcass and meat eating quality traits prior to feedlotting; The review concludes by recommending future research in whole genome sequencing to target specific genes associated with meat quality characteristics in order to explore the development of breeds with superior genes more suited to the North Australian beef industry. Further research into diverse nutritional strategies of phosphorus supplementation and fortifying tropically adapted grasses with protein-rich legumes and forages for backgrounding and supplementing lot-fed beef cattle with omega-3 oil of plant origin will ensure sustainable production of beef with a healthy composition, tenderness, taste and eating quality. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {As environments become urbanized, tolerant species become more prevalent. The physiological, behavioral and life-history mechanisms associated with the success of such species in urbanized habitats are not well understood, especially in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we examined the glucocorticoid (GC) profiles, life-history traits, and behavior of two species of fish across a gradient of urbanization to understand coping capacity and associated trade-offs. We studied the tolerant live-bearing Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) for two years and the slightly less tolerant, egg-laying, Blacktail Shiner (Cyprinella venusta) for one year. We used a water-borne hormone method to examine baseline, stress-induced, and recovery cortisol release rates across six streams with differing degrees of urbanization. We also measured life-history traits related to reproduction, and for G. affinis, we measured shoaling behavior and individual activity in a novel arena. Both species showed a trend for reduced stress responsiveness in more urbanized streams, accompanied by higher reproductive output. Although not all populations fit this trend, these results suggest that GC suppression may be adaptive for coping with urban habitats. In G. affinis, GC recovery increased with urbanization, and individuals with the lowest stress response and highest recovery had the greatest reproductive allotment, suggesting that rapid return to baseline GC levels is also an important coping mechanism. In G. affinis, urban populations showed altered life-history trade-offs whereas behavioral traits did not vary systematically with urbanization. Thus, these tolerant species of fish may cope with anthropogenically modified streams by altering their GC profiles and life-history trade-offs. These results contribute to understanding the mechanisms driving species-specific adaptations and thereby community structure in freshwater systems associated with land-use converted areas.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Shifts in the timing of cyclic seasonal life-history events are among the most commonly reported responses to climate change,with differences in response rates among interacting species leading to phenological mismatches. Within a species, however, males and females can also exhibit differential sensitivity to environmental cues and may, therefore, differ in their responsiveness to climate change, potentially leading to phenological mismatches between the sexes. This occurs because males differ from females in when and how energy is allocated to reproduction, resulting in marked sex-differences in life-history timing across the annual cycle. In this review, we take a Tinbergian perspective and examine sex-differences in timing of vertebrates from adaptive, ontogenetic, mechanistic, and phylogenetic viewpoints with the goal of informing and motivating more integrative research on sexually dimorphic phenologies. We argue that sexual and natural selection lead to sex-differences in life-history timing and that understanding the ecological and evolutionary drivers of these differences is critical for connecting climate-driven phenological shifts to population resilience. Ontogeny may influence how and when sex-differences in lifehistory timing arise because the early-life environment can profoundly affect developmental trajectory, rates of reproductive maturation, and seasonal timing. The molecular mechanisms underlying these organismal traits are relevant to identifying the diversity and genetic basis of population- and species-level responses to climate change, and promisingly, the molecular basis of phenology is becoming increasingly well-understood. However, because most studies focus on a single sex, the causes of sexdifferences in phenology critical to population resilience often remain unclear. New sequencing tools and analyses informed by phylogeny may help generate hypotheses about mechanism as well as insight into the general "evolvability"of sex-differences across phylogenetic scales, especially as trait and genome resources grow. We recommend that greater attention be placed on determining sex-differences in timingmechanisms and monitoring climate change responses in both sexes, and we discuss how new tools may provide key insights into sex-differences in phenology from all four Tinbergian domains.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

Two sections from the loin were taken from each animal and the following were analyzed: dry matter, crude protein, lipids, ash, fatty acids, pH, color, water-holding capacity, and lipid oxidation.

	abstract = {Morocco has a great diversity of reptiles; more than 26% of the herpetofauna species are considered to be endemic. Nevertheless, there is little information available on helminth parasites of Moroccan lizards. The purpose of this article is to establish a helminth list using non-invasive methods for natural populations of seven lizard species: Acanthodactylus maculatus, Chalcides mionecton, Chalcides montanus, Chalcides polylepis, Quedenfeldtia moerens, Quedenfeldtia trachyblepharus, and Tarentola mauritanica. For each species, prevalence and intensity of infection were given as well as their relationship to some determinant parameters (sex, age class, size, altitude, and seasons). Four species of nematodes, Parapharyngodon micipsae, Pharyngodon mamillatus, Spauligodon auziensis, Thelandros alatus, and unassigned Spauligodon were found. Mean helminth intensity for the seven lizard species was 7.3 ± 16.2 SD (range = 1–92 in infected lizards), with total infection prevalence of 5.6%. Mixed infections were observed in Chalcides montanus and Chalcides polylepis co-infected by Pharyngodon mamillatus and Spauligodon sp. Furthermore, the intensity of infection by nematodes were significantly different among the seven studied species. The nematode infection in Chalcides mionecton were related to sex, host size, and altitude; in Chalcides polylepis to the host age; in Quedenfeldtia trachyblepharus to elevation, age, and host size; and in Tarentola Mauritanica to age, body size, seasons, and altitude. In conclusion, our study provides data about nine new host and locality records and the effect of some determinant factors on host parasitism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {A prominent feature of the modern era is the increasing spread of invasive species, particularly within island and urban ecosystems, and these occurrences provide valuable natural experiments by which evolutionary and invasion hypotheses can be tested. In this study, we used the invasion route of guttural toads (Sclerophrys gutturalis) from natural-native and urban-native populations (Durban, South Africa) to their urban-invasive and natural-invasive populations (Mauritius and Réunion) to determine whether phenotypic changes that arose once the toads became urbanized in their native range have increased their invasive potential before they were transported (i.e., prior adaptation) or whether the observed changes are unique to the invasive populations. This urban/natural by native/invasive gradient allowed us to examine differences in guttural toad morphology (i.e., body size, hindlimb, and hindfoot length) and performance capacity (i.e., escape speed, endurance, and climbing ability) along their invasion route. Our findings indicate that invasive island populations have reduced body sizes, shorter limbs in relation to snout-vent length, decreased escape speeds, and decreased endurance capacities that are distinct from the native mainland populations (i.e., invasion-derived change). Thus, these characteristics did not likely arise directly from a pre-transport anthropogenic “filter” (i.e., urban-derived change). Climbing ability, however, did appear to originate within the urban-native range and was maintained within the invasive populations, thereby suggesting it may have been a prior adaptation that provided this species with an advantage during its establishment in urban areas and spread into natural forests. We discuss how this shift in climbing performance may be ecologically related to the success of urban and invasive guttural toad populations, as well as how it may have impacted other island-derived morphological and performance phenotypes. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This chapter, titled Principles of Crop Breeding and Productivity and authored by Elizabeth “Izzie” Gall, explores the possibilities and limitations of selective breeding from an evolutionary perspective. While many limits on plant growth can be overcome with artificial inputs, plants will always need to devote a certain amount of their energy to primary metabolism and growth. Human selection can act on the traits that utilize the remaining photosynthesized energy, creating artificial evolutionary pressure, a type of genetic modification. Plants that devote energy to the trait(s) most desired by the humans cultivating them have a major fitness advantage. However, photosynthetic efficiency is limited by the amount of light a leaf can physically capture as well as the erroneous action of Rubisco during photorespiration. Natural selection has created two alternatives to C3 photosynthesis, C4 and CAM photosynthesis, revealing that C3 plants possess the genetic material to develop greater photosynthetic efficiency. Intercropping, crop rotation, and genome-based genetic modification are introduced as additional methods to improve harvest index and other favorable traits in crop species. Finally, the chapter explores the possibility of mutating and breeding fungi to be co-cropped with plant species. © 2023 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Melophagus ovinus (Diptera: Hippoboscidae) is considered one of the main ectoparasites that attack sheep, however, in Ecuador information about this parasite is limited. In this study, the prevalence of M. ovinus in sheep was examined in Tungurahua province, Ecuador. For this purpose, sampling was performed in some semi-intensive and backyard sheep farming systems in different locations in Tungurahua. Significant differences were detected in the prevalence of M. ovinus between different locations, being higher in Ambato (39.3%), followed by Quero (33.5%), Mocha (32, 3%), Pelileo (30.7%), and Tisaleo (28%). Meanwhile, a significant decrease in prevalence was observed in Patate, Cevallos, and Píllaro ranging from 7.5% to 18%, and no M. ovinus was detected in Baños. No relationship was observed between the number of ectoparasites and the gender or age of the host sheep. A higher incidence was observed in males (58.45%) than in females (41.55%), even though it was not statistically significant according to Pearson's Chi-squared (p = 0.492). Similarly, when considering the effect of the age of an animal on the incidence of M. ovinus, no significant association was found based on Pearson's Chi-squared (p = 0.314). However, the animals aged 1-3 and older than 5 years showed a higher prevalence. This study highlights the need for further studies on the prevalence of M. ovinus in producing areas. © 2022 The author(s).},

	abstract = {Wooden breast (WB) is a widely prevalent myopathy in broiler chickens. However, the role of the gut microbiota in this myopathy remains largely unknown, in particular the regulatory effect of gut microbiota in the modulation of muscle metabolism. Totally, 300 1-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were raised until 49 days and euthanized, and the breast filets were classified as normal (NORM), mild (MILD), or severe wooden breast (SEV). Birds with WB comprised 27.02% of the individuals. Severe WB filets had a greater L* value, a* value, and dripping loss but a lower pH (P < 0.05). WB filets had abundant myofiber fragmentation, with a lower average myofiber caliber and more fibers with a diameter of <20 μm (P < 0.05). The diversity of the intestinal microflora was decreased in birds with severe WB, with decreases in Chao 1, and observed species indices. At the phylum level, birds with severe WB had a lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (P = 0.098) and a decreased abundance of Verrucomicrobia (P < 0.05). At the species level, gut microbiota were positively correlated with 131 digesta metabolites in pathways of glutamine and glutamate metabolism and arginine biosynthesis but were negatively correlated with 30 metabolites in the pathway of tyrosine metabolism. In plasma, WB induced five differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs), including anserine and choline, which were related to the severity of the WB lesion. The microbial-derived metabolites, including guanidoacetic acid, antiarol, and (2E)-decenoyl-ACP, which entered into plasma were related to meat quality traits and myofiber traits. In summary, WB filets differed in gut microbiota, digesta, and plasma metabolites. Gut microbiota respond to the wooden breast myopathy by driving dynamic changes in digesta metabolites that eventually enter the plasma.

	abstract = {Background: Organic trace minerals can improve the improve the bioavailability and reduce the environmental pollution, but the effect of organic trace minerals on meat quality of pigs are still unclear. Methods: Adult healthy 33.68 kg pigs (n=253) were randomly allotted to six dietary treatments, with 6 pens per treatment and 7-8 pigs per pen in a completely randomized design: 1) ITM: inorganic trace minerals with 20, 100, 40 and 60 mg/kg of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn in sulfate form; 2) T1: ITM was replaced with 20% mineral methionine hydroxy analog chelate (MMHAC); 3) T2: ITM was replaced with 40% MMHAC; 4) T3: ITM was replaced with 60% MMHAC; 5) T4: ITM was replaced with 80% MMHAC; 6) T5: ITM was replaced with 100% MMHAC. Result: In the present study, shoulder fat thickness, the 6th to 7th rib fat thickness (P<0.05), the 10th rib fat thickness, the last rib fat thickness and lumbosacral fat thickness tended to decrease with the increase of the MMHAC. In addition, MMHAC increased pH by 1.05∼3.68% and reduced drip loss by 5.08∼19.77% and cooking loss by 2.67∼7.67% compared with the ITM group. Furthermore, MMHAC reduced methionine by 3.51∼7.02%, phenylalanine by 1.14∼3.41%, arginine by 1.52∼3.79% compared with ITM group. Our results showed that MMHAC improved carcass traits, meat quality and meat flavor partly compared with the ITM group. © 2022 Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Acquisition of acquired chemoresistance during treatment cycles in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) is the major cause of death through enhancing the risk of cancer progression and metastasis. Elevated glucose flux through the abnormal upregulation of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase (OGT) controls key signaling and metabolic pathways regulating diverse cancer cell phenotypes. This study showed that OGT expression levels in two human UCB cell models with acquired resistance to gemcitabine and paclitaxel were significantly upregulated compared with those in parental cells. Reducing hyper-O-GlcNAcylation by OGT knockdown (KD) markedly facilitated chemosensitivity to the corresponding chemotherapeutics in both cells, and combination treatment with OGT-KD showed more severe growth defects in chemoresistant sublines. We subsequently verified the suppressive effects of OGT-KD monotherapy on cell migration/invasion in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo in chemoresistant UCB cells. Transcriptome analysis of these cells revealed 97 upregulated genes, which were enriched in multiple oncogenic pathways. Our final choice of suspected OGT glycosylation substrate was VCAN, S1PR3, PDGFRB, and PRKCG, the knockdown of which induced cell growth defects. These findings demonstrate the vital role of dysregulated OGT activity and hyper-O-GlcNAcylation in modulating treatment failure and tumor aggression in chemoresistant UCB. © 2022 by the authors.

Agave microfibers were obtained by a non-abrasive chemical method. Three formulations based on gelatin with glycerol were reinforced with microfiber, bentonite and both materials with 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5% w/w solids content. Physicochemical properties were determined using SEM and FTIR, thickness, soluble matter and moisture. The XRD, barrier, mechanical and thermal properties were measured. The films’ micrographs showed agglomerations on the surface. Interactions between its functional groups were found. The solubility increased when the MF concentration increased. The thickness of the films was between 60 and 110 µm. The crystallinity ranged from 23 to 86%. The films with both MF and BN and 3.5% w/w solids had the lowest barrier properties, while the film with 5.5% w/w solids showed the highest mechanical properties, being thermally resistant. Overall, Agave microfibers together with bentonite were able to improve some of the films’ properties, but optimized mixing conditions had to be used to achieve good particle dispersion within the gelatin matrix to improve its final properties. Such materials might have the potential to be used as food packaging. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Sarcoptic mange, a skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, is an emerging disease for some species of wildlife, potentially jeopardizing their welfare and conservation. Sarcoptes scabiei has a near-global distribution facilitated by its forms of transmission and use of a large diversity of host species (many of those with broad geographic distribution). In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge concerning the geographic and host taxonomic distribution of mange in wildlife, the epidemiological connections between species, and the potential threat of sarcoptic mange for wildlife conservation. Recent sarcoptic mange outbreaks in wildlife appear to demonstrate ongoing geographic spread, increase in the number of hosts and increased virulence. Sarcoptic mange has been reported in at least 12 orders, 39 families and 148 species of domestic and wild mammals, making it one of the most generalist ectoparasites of mammals. Taxonomically, the orders with most species found infested so far include Perissodactyla (67% species from the entire order), Artiodactyla (47%), and Diprotodontia (67% from this order). This suggests that new species from these mammal orders are likely to suffer cross-species transmission and be reported positive to sarcoptic mange as surveillance improves. We propose a new agenda for the study of sarcoptic mange in wildlife, including the study of the global phylogeography of S. scabiei, linkages between ecological host traits and sarcoptic mange susceptibility, immunology of individuals and species, development of control strategies in wildlife outbreaks and the effects of global environmental change in the sarcoptic mange system. The ongoing transmission globally and sustained spread among areas and wildlife species make sarcoptic mange an emerging panzootic in wildlife. A better understanding of sarcoptic mange could illuminate the aspects of ecological and evolutionary drivers in cross-species transmission for many emerging diseases. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Chitosan is among the most abundant and studied biopolymers. This is due to the versatile applications of chitosan and the ease of modifications of its functional groups to impart desired binding and physical properties. There is exhaustive literature on chitosan covering its wide applications, varying from medical devices and pharma applications to pollution control, which is driven by the abundance and the special properties (such as biocompatibility) of chitosan. Nuclear industry, due to its necessity to deal with both radioactive and nonradioactive metal ions during various waste processing needs, is on constant lookout for efficient and selective metal ion removal agents. This chapter attempts to document the various reports that have been published on the potential applications of chitosan in the nuclear industry. Though limited, the published literature on the radioactive nuclide removal by chitosan in the last two to three decades is very encouraging and deserves stock-taking. The review gives special emphasis on the various studies our research group has carried out toward bringing chitosan closer to the application side for targeted applications in the nuclear industry. The general characteristics, metal ion binding properties, and relevant modifications attempted in modifying the physical and chemical properties of the chitosan are also discussed. © 2022 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},

	abstract = {Sulla is a tanniferous legume species largely used as fresh or preserved forage in the ruminants’ diets. Due to its content in polyphenols with antioxidant activity, especially condensed tannins (CT), fresh sulla forage (FSF), when eaten by ruminants, is able to enrich animal products with antioxidant molecules and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that are beneficial for consumers’ health. Dehydration represents a valid alternative to haymaking to preserve these properties also in periods when FSF is unavailable. In this research, the effects of ewes’ diets based on sulla hay (SH), pelleted dehydrated sulla forage (DSF) or FSF were evaluated on cheese physico-chemical traits, including fatty acid (FA) profile, vitamins A and E, polyphenols, antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability. The individual daily milk from 10 first lambing (FL) and 10 third lambing (TL) Valle del Belìce ewes at about 60 days in milk, divided homogeneously into 5 groups fed different diets in a partial 5 × 2 Latin square design with 2 phases, and the bulk milk of farming ewes fed only on natural pasture, were used in 2 sessions of micro cheese-making to manufacture cheeses, sampled at 48 h of ripening. The experimental diets were: SHL = SH ad libitum; DSF2 = 2 kg/day DSF per head plus SH ad libitum; FSF2 = 2 kg/day FSF per head plus SH ad libitum; FSF4 = 4 kg/day FSF per head plus SH ad libitum; FSFL = FSF ad libitum. Concentrate was supplied at the amount of 0.8 or 1.2 kg/day per head for FL and TL, respectively. Cheese health properties greatly improved with FSFL diet, based on the exclusive use of fresh forage, that induced the increase in the content of molecules with antioxidant activity, as vitamin A, vitamin E and polyphenols, enhancing the oxidative stability, and the level of PUFA as rumenic acid (C18:2 c9t11) and α-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3n-3). Cheeses from the DSF2 group showed levels of vitamin A, vitamin E and PUFA higher than SHL cheeses and comparable to those of FSF4 cheeses, whereas their ALA content was not different from that of FSFL cheeses. Evaluating those molecules affected by the level of fresh forage in the diet for their ability to trace the animals’ feeding regime, ALA and its ratio with linoleic acid (LA, C18:2n-6) (LA/ALA) exhibited an effective role as biomarker in discriminating cheese from animals fed fresh forage-based diets. The results showed how dehydrated sulla pellets, as an alternative to hay in periods of limited availability of fresh forage, can preserve the nutritional and health properties of dairy products with regards to their antioxidant capacity and FA profile. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Camelina sativa, belonging to the Brassicaceae family, has been grown since 4000 B.C. as an oilseed crop that is more drought-and cold-resistant. Increased demand for its oil, meal, and other derivatives has increased researchers’ interest in this crop. Its anti-nutritional factors can be reduced by solvent, enzyme and heat treatments, and genetic engineering. Inclusion of camelina by-products increases branched-chain volatile fatty acids, decreases neutral detergent fiber digestibility, has no effect on acid detergent fiber digestibility, and lowers acetate levels in dairy cows. Feeding camelina meal reduces ruminal methane, an environmental benefit of using camelina by-products in ruminant diets. The addition of camelina to dairy cow diets decreases ruminal cellulolytic bacteria and bio-hydrogenation. This reduced bio-hydrogenation results in an increase in desirable fatty acids and a decrease in saturated fatty acids in milk obtained from cows fed diets with camelina seeds or its by-products. Studies suggest that by-products of C. sativa can be used safely in dairy cows at appropriate inclusion levels. However, suppression in fat milk percentage and an increase in trans fatty acid isomers should be considered when increasing the inclusion rate of camelina by-products, due to health concerns. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The plant genus Bidens (Asteraceae or Compositae; Coreopsidae) is a species-rich and circumglobally distributed taxon. The 19 hexaploid species endemic to the Hawaiian Islands are considered an iconic example of adaptive radiation, of which many are imperiled and of high conservation concern. Until now, no genomic resources were available for this genus, which may serve as a model system for understanding the evolutionary genomics of explosive plant diversification. Here, we present a high-quality reference genome for the Hawai'i Island endemic species B. hawaiensis A. Gray reconstructed from long-read, high-fidelity sequences generated on a Pacific Biosciences Sequel II System. The haplotype-aware, draft genome assembly consisted of ~6.67 Giga bases (Gb), close to the holoploid genome size estimate of 7.56 Gb (±0.44 SD) determined by flow cytometry. After removal of alternate haplotigs and contaminant filtering, the consensus haploid reference genome was comprised of 15 904 contigs containing ~3.48 Gb, with a contig N50 value of 422 594. The high interspersed repeat content of the genome, approximately 74%, along with hexaploid status, contributed to assembly fragmentation. Both the haplotype-aware and consensus haploid assemblies recovered >96% of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs. Yet, the removal of alternate haplotigs did not substantially reduce the proportion of duplicated benchmarking genes (~79% vs. ~68%). This reference genome will support future work on the speciation process during adaptive radiation, including resolving evolutionary relationships, determining the genomic basis of trait evolution, and supporting ongoing conservation efforts. © 2022 The American Genetic Association. 2022.},

	abstract = {Two main theories have been put forward to explain the origin of mitochondria in eukaryotes: phagotrophic engulfment (undigested food) and microbial symbiosis (physiological interactions). The two theories generate mutually exclusive predictions about the order in which mitochondria and phagocytosis arose. To discriminate the alternatives, we have employed ancestral state reconstructions (ASR) for phagocytosis as a trait, phagotrophy as a feeding habit, the presence of mitochondria, the presence of plastids, and the multinucleated organization across major eukaryotic lineages. To mitigate the bias introduced by assuming a particular eukaryotic phylogeny, we reconstructed the appearance of these traits across 1789 different rooted gene trees, each having species from opisthokonts, mycetozoa, hacrobia, excavate, archeplastida, and Stramenopiles, Alveolates and Rhizaria. The trees reflect conflicting relationships and different positions of the root. We employed a novel phylogenomic test that summarizes ASR across trees which reconstructs a last eukaryotic common ancestor that possessed mitochondria, was multinucleated, lacked plastids, and was non-phagotrophic as well as non-phagocytic. This indicates that both phagocytosis and phagotrophy arose subsequent to the origin of mitochondria, consistent with findings from comparative physiology. Furthermore, our ASRs uncovered multiple origins of phagocytosis and of phagotrophy across eukaryotes, indicating that, like wings in animals, these traits are useful but neither ancestral nor homologous across groups. The data indicate that mitochondria preceded the origin of phagocytosis, such that phagocytosis cannot have been the mechanism by which mitochondria were acquired.  © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Given the stochastic complexity of cancer diseases, the development of chemotherapeutic drugs is almost limited by problems of selectivity and side effects. Furthermore, an increasing number of protective approaches have been recently considered as the main way to limit these pathologies. Natural bioactive compounds, and particularly dietary phenolic compounds, showed major protective and therapeutic effects against different types of human cancers. Indeed, phenolic substances have functional groups that allow them to exert several anti-cancer mechanisms, such as the induction of apoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle arrest at different stages, and the inhibition of telomerase. In addition, in vivo studies show that these phenolic compounds also have anti-angiogenic effects via the inhibition of invasion and angiogenesis. Moreover, clinical studies have already highlighted certain phenolic compounds producing clinical effects alone, or in combination with drugs used in chemotherapy. In the present work, we present a major advance in research concerning the mechanisms of action of the different phenolic compounds that are contained in food medicinal plants, as well as evidence from the clinical trials that focus on them. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The foodborne transfer of resistant genes from enterococci to humans and their tolerance to several commonly used antimicrobials are of growing concern worldwide. Linezolid is a last-line drug for managing complicated illnesses resulting from multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria. The optrA gene has been reported in enterococci as one of the acquired linezolid resistance mechanisms. The present study uses whole-genome sequencing analysis to characterize the first reported isolates of linezolid-resistant E. faecium (n = 6) and E. faecalis (n = 10) harboring the optrA gene isolated from samples of supermarket broiler meat (n = 165) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The sequenced genomes were used to appraise the study isolates’ genetic relatedness, antimicrobial resistance determinants, and virulence traits. All 16 isolates carrying the optrA gene demonstrated multidrug-resistance profiles. Genome-based relatedness classified the isolates into five clusters that were independent of the isolate sources. The most frequently known genotype among the isolates was the sequence type ST476 among E. faecalis (50% (5/10)). The study isolates revealed five novel sequence types. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ranging from 5 to 13) were found among all isolates that conferred resistance against 6 to 11 different classes of antimicrobials. Sixteen different virulence genes were found distributed across the optrA-carrying E. faecalis isolates. The virulence genes in E. faecalis included genes encoding invasion, cell adhesion, sex pheromones, aggregation, toxins production, the formation of biofilms, immunity, antiphagocytic activity, proteases, and the production of cytolysin. This study presented the first description and in-depth genomic characterization of the optrA-gene-carrying linezolid-resistant enterococci from retail broiler meat in the UAE and the Middle East. Our results call for further monitoring of the emergence of linezolid resistance at the retail and farm levels. These findings elaborate on the importance of adopting a One Health surveillance approach involving enterococci as a prospective bacterial indicator for antimicrobial resistance spread at the human–food interface. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Temperature challenges are one of the leading abiotic causes of success or failure of non-native species in a novel environment, and this is particularly true for low temperatures. Establishing and reproducing in a novel thermal environment can alter survival, behavior, and traits related to fitness. It has been proposed that plasticity or adaptation of thermal tolerance may allow an introduced species to thrive, or that successful invaders may be those with a thermal breadth in their native habitat that encompasses their new environment. Here, we tested these hypotheses using native and invasive populations of Australian redback spiders (Latrodectus hasselti). We measured how exposure to temperatures common to invasive and native range habitats (exposure to 15 and 25°C, respectively) affected behavioral and life-history traits and trade-offs that may underlie fitness in an invasive population detected in 1995 in Japan and a native population from Australia. We found that the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) was higher in the invasive population from Japan than in the native population, but critical thermal maximum (CTmax) did not differ between populations. Compared to the invasive population, eggs from the native population had a longer development time and lower hatching success at 15°C. Both populations performed equally well at 25°C, as measured by egg development time and hatching success. Invasive juveniles tested at 15°C were faster to explore a novel environment and bolder compared to those tested at 25°C. In comparison, the native population showed faster average exploration, with no differences in boldness or exploration at the two development or testing temperatures. Overall, L. hasselti from Japan maintained hatching success and development across a wider temperature range than the native population, indicating greater thermal breadth and higher behavioral plasticity. These results support the importance of plasticity in thermal tolerance and behavior for a successful invasion under novel environmental temperatures. © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Dermatitis linearis is a toxic skin lesion caused by contact with certain beetles of the genus Paederus (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae). Dermatitis linearis outbreaks have been described mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, but so far not in Central Europe, and are considered an emerging public health concern potentially associated with climate change. Material and methods: Following diagnosis of dermatitis linearis in a cluster of six adults and one child with reported exposure to beetles with morphological characteristics of Paederus species at a recreational public open-air bath at Lake Neusiedl (Illmitz, Burgenland, Austria), we performed on-site inspection and installed light and pitfall traps. Collected beetle specimens of the genus Paederus were classified using morphological characteristics and DNA barcoding. Results: A total of 32 Paederus beetles were collected using an aspirator (n = 2) and light traps (n = 30). No individuals of the genus Paederus were captured with the pitfall traps. Morphological analyses identified them as members of the Paederus balcanicus species, which was confirmed by genetic specification of four arbitrarily chosen individuals. Dermatitis linearis lesions were treated with topical steroids and healed but partly leaving scars and hyperpigmentation, over the course of a few weeks in all affected persons. Conclusion: We report for the first time (a) an outbreak of dermatitis linearis associated with exposure to autochthonous Paederus species in Austria, and (b) that contact to the species Paederus balcanicus may cause dermatitis linearis in humans. Adequate measures should be taken to prevent dermatitis linearis outbreaks in areas with resident Paederus occurrence. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Heat stress is reported to have deleterious effects on rabbit physiology by impairing reproductive performances arising from free radical production due to oxidative stress. Plant extracts have been listed among efficient and healthy strategies for alleviating the effects of free radicals in the body of an animal. Numerous studies have documented the medicinal value of Moringa oleifera on various body functional systems although most of these data have not been scientifically validated. The growing concern of heat stress owing to the effects of global warming has affected animal productivity and even reproductive health, yet mitigation measures are still scanty. To this end, we investigated the efficacy of Moringa oleifera aqueous seed extract on selected in the alleviation of morphofunctional impairments on functional systems of the body. Here, we quantified the effects of Moringa oleifera seed extracts on reproductive performances, hormonal profile, and ovarian histology in the management of heat stress in female rabbits. We were particularly interested in testing the hypothesis that Moringa oleifera seed extracts do not have medicinal value in the mitigation of oxidative stress accompanying heat-stressed animals and, therefore, affecting growth performance and reproductive value. Twenty-eight female rabbits aged 6 months and weighing between 2015.6 and 2322.7 g were randomly assigned to four treatment groups of temperature, relative humidity, temperature humidity index, and M. oleifera seed extracts as follows: T0: ambient temperature (18–24°C), 59 ± 0.48%, 23.6 ± 1.52; T1, T2, and T3: 35–36°C, 64 ± 0.6%, 32.5 ± 0.7, followed by 100, 200, and 0 mg/kg b.w of M. oleifera seed extracts. Artificial heat was introduced in each rabbit cage from 08:00 h to 16:00 h. Reproductive performances related to female rabbits and relevant biodata of their young ones were recorded. All animals were sacrificed at the end of 80 days of experiments, and blood was collected for hormonal assays and ovary tissues for histology. Data on hormones and reproductive parameters of adult females as well as parameters related to kid performance and milk yield were subjected to one-way ANOVA, and significant differences among treatment subjects were analyzed using Tukey's post-hoc test at 5% significance level. The results revealed a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in food consumption, body weight, and body weight gain in pregnant and lactating female rabbits exposed to heat stress. A decrease in fur removal by mothers, litter size from birth to weaning, litter weight, kid body weight, and body weight gain in adult rabbits submitted to heat stress was observed. The findings were also reflected on weekly milk yield and daily milk efficiency as well as serum hormone levels. Following administration of M. oleifera seed extracts at 200 mg/kg b.w., there was significant increase (P < 0.05) in these parameters. On the contrary, an increase (P < 0.05) in the number of services per conception, milk intake, and serum progesterone level was initially observed in the same subjects, but upon administration of M. oleifera seed extracts, there was a significant decrease (P < 0.05) on these measures. Ovarian histology of animals at T0 and T2 treatments showed structural features comparable to those of controls. Overall, our results show that administration of M. oleifera seed extracts at 200 mg/kg b.w possesses therapeutic value to the effects of oxidative stress associated with heat stress. Further pharmacological evaluation on seed extracts of M. oleifera may yield the much-needed medicine in the treatment and management of poor animal productivity and reproductive health arising from severe weather associated with global warming.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to review the existing literature on some important morphological traits associated with reproductive and productive performance in Bangladeshi indigenous and exotic cross sheep. Sheep as small ruminants are essential parts of the crop-livestock of the mixed agricultural farming system playing a crucial role in the livelihood of smallholders in Bangladesh. They are considered risk averters for farmers in a family crisis and seasonal needs through quick sale by direct cash income. Furthermore, their physical products have socio-economic, cultural, and nutritional values: meat, milk, skin, manure, etc. In the past, a number of researchers investigated the relationship between morphometric features and reproductive and productive performance of the referred sheep. Any compilation report is yet not available. Therefore, an update database on Bangladeshi indigenous and exotic cross-breed sheep is required to identify for management and production strategy program.

Undoubtedly this will lead to a higher protein requirement, consequently more meat. Therefore, producers, animal researchers and feed manufacturers will need to enhance animal nutrition and productivity, for instance. Growth Promoters (GPs) are widely used to accomplish these needs, and minimize economic losses. Thereby, this review aims to report the current scientific data on the use of GPs in cattle and pig production, their effect on meat quality and carcass traits, and possible impacts on animal health. It was noted that GPs have relevant benefits on carcass composition, although there are some minor negative effects on meat quality. Risks to animal health are low, given that the correct GPs dosages must be administered. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Cadmium (Cd) is amongst the most toxic heavy metals that severely affects crop growth, whereas application of nanoparticles (NPs) to negate the toxic effects of heavy metals could be an effective management approach. In the present study, the seeds of two fragrant rice varieties i.e., Yuxiangyouzhan and Xiangyaxiangzhan under normal and Cd stress conditions i.e., 0 and 100 mg L− 1 applied with four levels of ZnO NPs i.e., 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg L− 1. Results: Seed priming with ZnO NPs had no significant effect on the seed germination (p > 0.05) however, it substantially improved the seedling growth and other related physiological attributes under the Cd stress. The mean fresh weight of the shoot, and whole seedling was increased by 16.92–27.88% and by 16.92–27.88% after ZnO NPs application. The root fresh weight, root-shoot length was also substantially improved under ZnO NPs treatment. Moreover, application of ZnO NPs induced modulations in physiological and biochemical attributes e.g., the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in root and shoot, the peroxidase (POD) activity and metallothionein contents in root were increased under low levels of ZnO NPs. The α-amylase and total amylase activity were improved by ZnO NPs application under Cd Stress. Besides, modulation in Zn concentration and ZnO NPs uptake in the seedling were detected. The metabolomic analysis indicated that various pathways such as alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism were possibly important for rice response to ZnO NPs and Cd. Conclusion: Overall, application of ZnO NPs substantially improved the early growth and related physio-biochemical attributes in rice. Our findings provide new insights regarding the effects of ZnO NPs on seed germination, and early growth of rice, and its potential applications in developing crop resilience against Cd contaminated soils.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Fire is one of the most common disasters threatening public safety and social development; arson, a typical violent crime, is a serious threat to people ' s lives and property. Suspects are likely to use accelerants to commit effective and rapid arson. Therefore, the identification of accelerants is of crucial importance in determining the nature of a fire. Fires are commonly complex and intricate, leading to remarkable interference in accelerant identification. During the development of a fire, thermal environment influences the preformed accelerant combustion residues, causing the characteristic components of the accelerant to volatilize/ pyrolyze to different degrees, thus interfering with accelerant identification. There are numerous petrochemicals with characteristic components similar to those of accelerants in fire scenes, also contributing to the interference in the determination of the presence of accelerants. After the fire is extinguished, the combustion residues of the accelerant in the fire scene are influenced by the combined effects of heat, light, and pressure in the ambient environment, resulting in the loss of the mass fraction of characteristic components, mainly in the form of volatilization. In particular, with countless microorganisms in the soil, the characteristic components of the present accelerants are degraded, resulting in the reduction or absence of some components, which seriously influences the accuracy of accelerant identification. This study describes the progress of research on the interference in accelerant identification induced by various factors at fire scenes from four aspects: thermal environment, matrix interference, weathering effect, and microbial degradation, with emphasis on the interference from the first aspect. Based on the correlation between the matrix chemical composition/structure and interference degree, new results pertaining to the interference source in accelerant identification are also considered. The shortcomings of current research and the prospects for future research are put forward to provide a reference for accelerant identification at fire scenes. Many studies have been conducted on the above four types of interference in recent years, which provide important reference for accelerant identification regarding the arson caused by ignitable liquids. However, with the application of new materials and techniques, fire scenes have become increasingly complex, which demands higher requirements for accelerant identification in forensic science. Research on thermal environment interference is still in its infancy, and it is of great practical significance to conduct this research on other types of accelerants coupled with other interference factors. In addition, the principle of most of the current research on selecting objects is based on common appearance at fire scenes, rather than the functional group of the chemical structure of the matrix. Systematic and in-depth research on the interference law and mechanism is urgently required, and it is vital to further explore the interference law of the fire background from the perspective of the chemical composition and chemical structure of the substrate. Compared to foreign countries, there is less research on the interference of weathering and microbial effects on ignitable liquid identification in China. Most importantly, there is a lack of unified provisions, such as standard experimental methods to carry out such research, making it urgent to establish relevant standards and specifications. Additionally, while weathering is caused by multiple factors, the existing research on the interference of the weathering effect with ignitable liquid identification focuses merely on volatilization. Therefore, a more accurate experimental design is necessary. Improving the database of interferents under fire conditions, and combining the application of the chemometrics method for the artificial intelligence identification of the combustion residue spectrum, is an effective way to further improve the identification efficiency and accuracy. © 2022.

This review aims to investigate the effect of hematology parameters and hemoglobin types on the adaptation and reproductive performance of sheep. Hematological parameters are useful tools for the detection of adaptation and physiological traits of these animals. The reproduction of sheep has depended on the ability of each type and breed to acclimate to different environmental conditions. In addition, hemoglobin types have also been correlated with the environmental adaptability and physiological traits of sheep. Thus, the present review provides useful information on the association of hematology parameters and hemoglobin types in sheep with adaptation and reproductive performance, and could be used as vital tools that help in determining the species or breed of sheep that are more adapted to certain environments or have more reproductive potential. © 2021, University of Mosul - College of Veterinary Medicine.

	abstract = {Eating quality is one of the most important traits by which consumers evaluate satisfaction and make decisions on future beef purchases. Unfortunately, the beef on the market is of inconsistent quality. Therefore, meat producers supplying beef of good and consistent quality would be more competitive in the beef market. The main attributes of eating quality are flavor, juiciness, tenderness, and overall liking. Beef eating quality is an intrinsic quality trait, which depends on both pre- and post-slaughter factors. In this review, we attempt to describe the impact of the major factors determining beef eating quality throughout the production chain such as: breed, farming systems, animal welfare, electrical stimulation, carcass suspension methods, chilling process associated with pH drop and aging methods. As part of this review, some the effects were extracted and summarized to give an overview of the magnitude of the effects and to understand which effects have the greatest impact. © 2021},

	abstract = {The domestication and subsequent development of sheep are crucial events in the history of human civilization and the agricultural revolution. However, the impact of interspecific introgression on the genomic regions under domestication and subsequent selection remains unclear. Here, we analyze the whole genomes of domestic sheep and their wild relative species. We found introgression from wild sheep such as the snow sheep and its American relatives (bighorn and thinhorn sheep) into urial, Asiatic and European mouflons. We observed independent events of adaptive introgression from wild sheep into the Asiatic and European mouflons, as well as shared introgressed regions from both snow sheep and argali into Asiatic mouflon before or during the domestication process. We revealed European mouflons might arise through hybridization events between a now extinct sheep in Europe and feral domesticated sheep around 6000–5000 years BP. We also unveiled later introgressions from wild sheep to their sympatric domestic sheep after domestication. Several of the introgression events contain loci with candidate domestication genes (e.g., PAPPA2, NR6A1, SH3GL3, RFX3 and CAMK4), associated with morphological, immune, reproduction or production traits (wool/meat/milk). We also detected introgression events that introduced genes related to nervous response (NEURL1), neurogenesis (PRUNE2), hearing ability (USH2A), and placental viability (PAG11 and PAG3) into domestic sheep and their ancestral wild species from other wild species. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Cultivated carrot is one of the most important vegetable plants in the world and favored by consumers for its typically sweet flavor. Unfortunately, the attractive sensory quality is hindered by a sporadic bitter off-taste. To evaluate the influence of the abiotic stress conditions, waterlogging and drought, on the bitter sensometabolome as well as agronomical traits of six genotypes of Daucus carota, a field trial was performed. Enabling the accurate tracing of carrots’ bitter compounds and therefore their metabolic changes, a fast and robust high-throughput UHPLC-MS/MS was developed and validated. Remarkably, the genotypes are the driving source for the biological fate of the bitter metabolites that are reflected in concentrations, dose-over-threshold factors, and fold changes. A certain influence of the irrigation level is observable but is overruled by its cultivar. Therefore, metabolic stress response in carrots seems to be genotype dependent. Hence, this study might help to plant specific carrot genotypes that are adapted to stress conditions evoked by future climatic changes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

However, we know little about how microbial communities respond to phytohormones, or how these responses are shaped by chronic (long-term) drought. Here, we added three phytohormones (abscisic acid, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and jasmonic acid) to soils from long-term (25-year), field-based climate treatments to test the hypothesis that chronic drought alters soil microbial community responses to plant stress signalling. Phytohormone addition increased soil respiration, but this effect was stronger in irrigated than in droughted soils and increased soil respiration at low phytohormone concentrations could not be explained by their use as substrate. Thus, we show that drought adaptation within soil microbial communities modifies their responses to phytohormone inputs. Furthermore, distinct phytohormone-induced shifts in microbial functional groups in droughted vs. irrigated soils might suggest that drought-adapted soil microorganisms perceive phytohormones as stress-signals, allowing them to anticipate impending drought. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In most species, several factors like time of emergence, age at maturation, reproductive life span, survival of males and females, mating behavior, differential resource use, and migration patterns may affect the adult sex ratio. Anthropogenic landscape transformation is known to change diversity, favoring colonization by exotic species but other populational parameters, such as the sex ratio, have not been assessed. The aim of the present study was to describe the sex-ratio patterns of adult necrophagous blow flies captured using carrion-baited traps along habitats representing different levels of human impact. We describe the sex bias for four species: the exotic Chrysomya albiceps, Chrysomya megacephala, Chrysomya putoria, and the native Cochliomyia macellaria. Three types of habitats were selected: highly anthropized (urbanized), moderately anthropized (rural), and native forest (natural) within a humid subtropical ecoregion in Northeastern Argentina. We found an overall trend to female bias among the four species when considering the total number of each sex. However, our study showed a changing sex-ratio pattern along the gradient of human influence. Our results indicate that a higher likelihood of trapping more males in unsuitable habitats seems to be widespread among blow flies. Urban exploiters, such as Ch. megacephala and Ch. putoria, locally shifted their trends, becoming male-biased in natural habitats. The opposite trend was detected in the urban avoider Co. macellaria (which shifted to male-biased in urban habitats). The exception was Ch. albiceps, whose sex proportion did not shift to a male-biased sex ratio. The results of this study highlight the changing sex-ratio patterns displayed by Calliphoridae in response to different conditions along a human-influence gradient. The biological traits and underlying mechanisms promoting the intraspecific changes of the sex ratio are discussed. © 2021},

The results showed that drought stress significantly increased the malt protein and α-amino nitrogen contents, and the Kolbach index, and reduced malt extract rate and viscosity, with ZU9 being more largely affected than XZ166. Drought treatment at the early grain-filling stage (7 d after anthesis) caused much larger changes of all the examined malt qualities in ZU9 than in XZ166, while for the drought treatment at the middle grain-filling stage (14 d after anthesis), the changes of these quality traits were much larger in XZ166 than in ZU9. It may be concluded that drought stress occurred during the grain-filling stage had a great impact on malt quality, which should be addressed in breeding and agronomic management of malt. In the actual production, appropriate varieties should be selected according to the occurrence time of the drought, so as to avoid the drought stress during the critical period of quality formation. © 2022 Zhejiang University Press},

In the present study, an attempt was made for the first time in India to assess the relationship among morphological traits and to explain the body conformation of Aseel and Kadaknath breeds under backyard poultry farming using principal component analysis (PCA). Eleven different morphological traits viz., 24-week body weight, comb length, keel length, body length, back length, breast girth, breast angle, radius-ulna length, shank length, shank circumference, and tail length were measured in both breeds. In both breeds, the correlations between all morphological characteristics were found to be positive and significant (p < 0.01) and varied from 0.245 (tail length and breast girth) to 0.797 (shank circumference and shank length) in Aseel and 0.247 (shank length and 24-week body weight) to 0.768 (back length and body length) in Kadaknath. All morphological traits had a high correlation with 24-week body weight in both chicken breeds suggesting the probable use of morphometric traits in predicting body weight. The extracted two components accounted for 64.822% and 68.286% of the total variability present in the original traits in Aseel and Kadaknath, respectively. It was concluded that PCA is an interesting tool for evaluation and effective to reduce the number of variables required to explain the body conformation in Aseel and Kadaknath breeds. © 2022 TUBITAK.

	abstract = {Transitional zones, such as edge habitat, are key landscapes for investigating biodiversity. “Soft edges” are permeable corridors that hosts can cross, while “hard edges” are impermeable borders that hosts cannot pass. Although pathogen transmission in the context of edges is vital to species conservation, drivers of host-parasite relationships in ecological edges remain poorly understood. Thus, we defined a framework for testing hypotheses of host-parasite interactions in hard and soft edges by (1) characterizing hard and soft edges from both the host and parasite perspectives, (2) predicting the types of parasites that would be successful in each type of edge, and (3) applying our framework to species invasion fronts as an example of host-parasite relationships in a soft edge. Generally, we posited that parasites in soft edges are more likely to be negatively affected by habitat fragmentation than their hosts because they occupy higher trophic levels but parasite transmission would benefit from increased host connectivity. Parasites along hard edges, however, are at higher risk of local extinction due to host population perturbations with limited opportunity for parasite recolonization. We then used these characteristics to predict functional traits that would lead to parasite success along soft and hard edges. Finally, we applied our framework to invasive species fronts to highlight predictions regarding host connectivity and parasite traits in soft edges. We anticipate that our work will promote a more complete discussion of habitat connectivity using a common framework and stimulate empirical research into host-parasite relationships within ecological edges and transitional zones. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Objective — to reveal and analyze clinical characteristics, knee joint histopathology, and quality of life in patients at late stages of knee osteoarthritis (OA) triggered by age, trauma, metabolic syndrome, or their combination. Material and methods — We studied 120 subjects with knee OA (sensu Altman R.D., 1991) of Kellgren-Lawrence Grades 3-4. They were distributed among 4 groups (30 participants in each) based on the presence of age-related, post-traumatic, metabolic, or combined phenotypes. Clinical examination of patients with pain and their functional status evaluation (via Visual Analogue Scale, WOMAC, Lequesne index), quality of life assessment (MOS SF-36 questionnaire), along with histopathological study of medial tibial plateau cartilage and synovial membrane, were caried out, followed by statistical data processing. Results — Age-related OA phenotype was characterized by the latest clinical onset [59.5 (54-68) years of age] with the largest average patient age [72.5 (63-77) years], moderate to severe pain and knee dysfunction [total WOMAC score of 160 (127-190) points and Lequesne index of 20 (8-21) points], severe degenerative cartilage lesions [8.5 (6-10) points sensu Mankin] with high-grade synovitis [5 (3-8) points sensu Krenn]. Post-traumatic OA phenotype was distinguished by the lowest pain, stiffness and knee functional limitations [total WOMAC score of 129 (100-166), Lequesne index of 15 (14-19)], the highest quality of life in patients [physical component summary of 34.1 (30.5-36.1) points, mental component summary of 40.4 (32.9-43.8) points] against the background of local severe cartilage lesions [8 (6-8) sensu Mankin] with reparative pattern and synovial fibrosis. For metabolic OA phenotype, the typical traits included female-biased sex ratio (87%), high prevalence of clinical synovitis (77%), severe pain and functional knee disorders [total WOMAC score of 188 (162-207) points, Lequesne index of 20 (19-23) points], the worst quality of life [physical component summary of 28.0 (24.3-31.9) points, mental component summary of 30.9 (26.9-35.9) points], vascular invasion of cartilage, and high-grade synovitis [4 (3-5) points sensu Krenn]. Combined OA phenotype was characterized by variable clinical and histopathological features. Conclusion — Comprehensive comparative clinical and morphological analysis of late-stage knee OA of various origin was completed, and age-related, post-traumatic, metabolic and combined OA phenotypes were studied. The methodological basis for differential approach to treating different categories of OA patients was developed. © 2020, Russian Open Medical Journal},

	abstract = {Feed efficiency (FE) is an important measure of productivity in the layer industry; however, little is known about how FE differs between individual hens during the egg-laying cycle and the implications for egg quality parameters. Individual 25-week-old ISA Brown hens were observed for 42 days, ranked into three FE groups (n = 48 per High (HFE), Medium (MFE) and Low (LFE) FE groups and then monitored later in the laying cycle from 35–40 weeks. The groups exhibited different feed to egg conversion ratios (p < 0.001) from 35–40 weeks. Average daily feed intake and body weight were highest (p < 0.001) in the LFE group compared to the MFE and HFE groups, while albumen height, Haugh unit and amino acid concentrations of the albumen were significantly higher in the HFE groups compared to the LFE cohort (p < 0.001). This study concludes that FE status established in early lay is a stable variable until at least 40 weeks of age, and overweight, mid-laying hens that had poor FE produced inferior egg albumen quality measurements and composition. The distinct traits of the highly efficient hens and the poor feed efficient hens may provide important information to improving productivity in egg production. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The drive to withstand environmental stresses and defend against invasion is a universal trait extant in all forms of life. While numerous canonical signaling cascades have been characterized in detail, it remains unclear how these pathways interface to generate coordinated responses to diverse stimuli. To dissect these connections, we followed heparanase (HPSE), a protein best known for its endoglycosidic activity at the extracellular matrix but recently recognized to drive various forms of late-stage disease through unknown mechanisms. Using herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection as a model cellular perturbation, we demonstrate that HPSE acts beyond its established enzymatic role to restrict multiple forms of cell-intrinsic defense and facilitate host cell reprogramming by the invading pathogen. We reveal that cells devoid of HPSE are innately resistant to infection and counteract viral takeover through multiple amplified defense mechanisms. With a unique grasp of the fundamental processes of transcriptional regulation and cell death, HPSE represents a potent cellular intersection with broad therapeutic potential. © 2021, Agelidis et al.},

	abstract = {Food legumes are at the crossroads of many societal challenges that involve agriculture, such as climate change and food sustainability and security. In this context, pulses have a crucial role in the development of plant-based diets, as they represent a very good source of nutritional components and improve soil fertility, such as by nitrogen fixation through symbiosis with rhizobia. The main contribution to promotion of food legumes in agroecosystems will come from plant breeding, which is guaranteed by the availability of well-characterized genetic resources. Here, we analyze seeds of 25 American and European common bean purified accessions (i.e., lines of single seed descent) for different morphological and compositional quality traits. Significant differences among the accessions and superior genotypes for important nutritional traits are identified, with some lines showing extreme values for more than one trait. Heritability estimates indicate the importance of considering the effects of environmental growth conditions on seed compositional traits. They suggest the need for more phenotypic characterization in different environments over different years to better characterize combined effects of environment and genotype on nutritional trait variations. Finally, adaptation following the introduction and spread of common bean in Europe seems to have affected its nutritional profile. This finding further suggests the relevance of evolutionary studies to guide breeders in the choice of plant genetic resources. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Firefighters' performance of their occupational duties is associated with significant psycho-emotional stress, as well as the complex influence of harmful and dangerous factors that are a source of risk to their health and life. One of the most important modern tasks of vocational training of employees in the EMERCOM of Russia is the problem of assessing psychophysiological reserves. Currently, traditional methods of psychological and psychophysiological testing do not allow a full assessment of psychophysiological reserves because the degree of adaptation to extreme loads is determined by hereditary traits. AIM: To study the features of cognitive mental processes and neurodynamic properties of the central nervous system in firefighters that depend on the polymorphisms of the regulators genes of the monoamine system of the brain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Methodologically, 453 people were examined, of which 234 were the main group (firefight-ers), and 219 were the control group. Assessment was conducted using the following methods: "Correction test with Landolt rings", "Münsterberg test", "Schulte tables", "Reaction to a moving object", "Simple visual-motor reaction", and KR-3-85 test batteries. Genotyping was performed using five candidate genes of 5-HTTLPR or 5HTT, 5HT2A, COMT, DRD1, and DRD2/ANKK1. RESULTS: The results of indicators of attention, neurodynamic properties of the central nervous system, and cognitive mental processes, depending on the nature of the occupational tasks performed and employment duration, indicates the strain of the functional systems of the body during long-term work (more than five years) in the main study group (firefighters). Firefighters carrying 5HTT L/L, 5HT2A C/C, COMT Val/Val, and DRD2/ANKK1 Glu/Glu genotypes have significantly higher rates than those of 5HTT S/S, 5HT2A Т/Т genotypes, COMT Met/Met, and DRD2/ANKK1 Lis/Lis, and at the same time lower indicators compared to individuals with similar genotypes from the control group. CONCLUSION: The data obtained indicate the feasibility of practical application of studies of the 5HTT, 5HT2A, and DRD2/ ANKK1 genes. Changes in the level of attention and neurodynamic properties of the central nervous system depending on the polymorphic variants of the DRD1 gene were not observed. The indicators of cognitive mental processes in the control and main groups differed depending on the polymorphic variants of the COMT gene. © Authors, 2022.},

Animal welfare is a major concern and polled animals do not need to be subjected to painful dehorning; additional advantages include lower injury risks during transport and improved safety during handling of the animals. The polled condition has been studied over many decades suggesting various modes of inheritance for polled and scur. Since the completion of the bovine reference genome and the advancement of bovine genomics, developments in molecular technology provided additional tools for investigating the genetic basis of the polled and scurs phenotypes. Even though four causal mutations of the POLLED locus have been identified, the molecular basis governing polled/horned condition and the underlying genetics for scurs remains unclear. In this review, a brief overview is provided on the growth and development of horns followed by a discussion on the molecular advancements made over the past two decades in identifying the POLLED gene and associated variants. The identification of the SCURS locus is complicated by the lack of accurate recording of phenotypes for scurs on-farm. © 2021},

	abstract = {Background: Digital transcriptomics is rapidly emerging as a powerful new technology for modelling the environmental dynamics of the adaptive landscape in diverse lineages. This is particularly valuable in taxa such as turtles and tortoises (order Testudines) which contain a large fraction of endangered species at risk due to anthropogenic impacts on the environment, including pollution, overharvest, habitat degradation, and climate change. Sea turtles (family Cheloniidae) in particular invite a genomics-enabled approach to investigating their remarkable portfolio of adaptive evolution. The sex of the endangered loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is subject to temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), a mechanism by which exposure to temperatures during embryonic development irreversibly determines sex. Higher temperatures produce mainly female turtles and lower temperatures produce mainly male turtles. Incubation temperature can have long term effects on the immunity, migratory ability, and ultimately longevity of hatchlings. We perform RNA-seq differential expression analysis to investigate tissue-and temperature-specific gene expression within brain (n = 7) and gonadal (n = 4) tissue of male and female loggerhead hatchlings. Results: We assemble tissue-and temperature-specific transcriptomes and identify differentially expressed genes relevant to sexual development and life history traits of broad adaptive interest to turtles and other amniotic species. We summarize interactions among differentially expressed genes by producing network visualizations, and highlight shared biological pathways related to migration, immunity, and longevity reported in the avian and reptile literature. Conclusions: The measurement of tissue-and temperature-specific global gene expression of an endangered, flagship species such as the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) reveals the genomic basis for potential resiliency and is crucial to future management and conservation strategies with attention to changing climates. Brain and gonadal tissue collected from experimentally reared loggerhead male and female hatchlings comprise an exceedingly rare dataset that permits the identification of genes enriched in functions related to sexual development, immunity, longevity, and migratory behavior and will serve as a large, new genomic resource for the investigation of genotype–phenotype relationships in amniotes. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This study aimed to assess the effects of thermogenic oils (safflower and coconut oils) as a replacement for ractopamine in heavy pig diets. A total of 24 mix-breed barrows with an average weight of 98.70 ± 1.63 kg were distributed in a randomized block design with four treatments and six replicates. Treatments were as follows: basal diet, modified basal diet + 10 ppm ractopamine, basal diet + safflower oil, and basal diet + coconut oil. Animal performance, organ weights, meat quality, carcass traits, and economic viability were determined. Data were analyzed using Duncan's test at the 5% significance level. The safflower oil diet resulted in the highest carcass meat and ham weights, whereas the coconut oil diet provided the highest loin eye area and the lowest fat area, resulting in the highest meat/fat ratio. Analysis of economic viability indicators revealed that vegetable oil treatments differed significantly from other treatments in feed cost, feed cost per kilogram of live weight, economic viability index, and cost index, given that oil inclusion increased the price of diets. Supplementation of heavy pig diets with thermogenic oils is a viable alternative to enhance lean meat production, but its use depends on market availability and product price. © 2022 Universidade Federal Rural do Semi-Arido.

Even at extreme survival conditions, this cattle provides around 2–5 kg of milk. This highly evolved germplasm might possess unique alleles or combinations of alleles, hence attempt was made to study the frequency of allelic variants at important candidate gene loci affecting dairy traits. The observed distribution pattern of allele frequencies were different from taurine but in accordance with other Indian native cattle breeds indicating maintenance of indicine characteristics and near absence of taurine influence/introgression effect on this naturally evolved germplasm. Further, variant E at κ-CN locus and two novel variants at BTN-3 loci were also observed. The present findings helped to understand the unique Ladakhi cattle population with respect to polymorphism and distribution of various alleles in candidate genes related to milk traits. © 2021 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

	abstract = {Late season nitrogen (N) applications may serve as cultural practices to increase soybean yield and grain protein concentration in modern high-yielding cultivars. A study to evaluate the response of soybean cultivars to late N application in supplementation to Bradyrhizobium spp. inoculation was conducted in two Brazilian Cerrado agricultural soils with medium and high fertility during the 2019/2020 growing season. Treatments were arranged in a randomized block design in a 2×2×5 factorial scheme: two agricultural production environments [UFMS 1 (medium fertility) and UFMS 2 (high fertility)], two soybean cultivars (TMG 7067 IPRO and BMX Bônus IPRO), and five late N application rates (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg N ha–1), with four replicates. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was used to investigate the interrelationships between the groups of independent (agricultural production environments, soybean cultivars, and N application rates) and dependent (soybean agronomic traits) variables. Nitrogen rates were applied in topdressing at the R5.3 soybean growth stage. Late N applications did not affect soybean agronomic traits (plant height, first pod height, pod number per plant, grain number per pod, and 1,000-grain mass) and did not increase the grain protein concentration or yield of the soybean cultivars, regardless of the fertility level of the agricultural area. We conclude that when efficient strains of Bradyrhizobium spp. are used in soybean cropping in medium-and high-fertility Cerrado soils, there is no need to apply late rates of N fertilizer. © 2022, Federal University of Lavras.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters of somatic cell count (SCC) and its relationship with production traits in the first three parities in Iranian Holstein dairy cows. Data were 1,891,559 test-day records of SCC, milk yield, and milk compositions on 276,217 lactations on 147,278 cows distributed in 134 herds. The number of test-day records in the first, second and third parities were 995,788 (on 147,278 cows), 593,848 (on 85,153 cows), and 301,923 (on 43,786 cows), respectively. Test-day SCCs were transformed to somatic cell scores (SCS). A random regression test-day animal model through four-trait three-lactation was used to estimate variance components for test-day records of SCS and lactation traits were included. Gibbs sampling was used to obtain marginal posterior distributions for the various parameters using a single chain of 200,000 iterates in which the first 50,000 iterates of each chain were regarded as a burn-in period. The mean heritability estimates for SCS (0.15 to 0.18) were lower than those for milk yield (0.36 to 0.38), fat yield (0.30 to 0.31), protein yield (0.31 to 0.32), fat percentage (0.21 to 0.25), and protein percentage (0.21 to 0.22). Low negative genetic correlations ranging from −0.05 to −0.30 were found between SCS and yield traits (milk, fat, and protein yields). The genetic correlation found between SCS and fat percentage was close to zero, however, a low positive genetic correlation ranging from 0.12 to 0.17 was found between SCS and protein percentage. Based on the results, it can be concluded that genetic selection for decreasing SCS would also increase lactation yield. The estimates found in this study can be used to perform breeding value estimations for national genetic evaluations in Iranian Holsteins using a multiple-trait, multiple-lactation random regression model. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are relevant means for transferring signals across cells and facilitate propagation of oncogenic stimuli promoting disease evolution and metastatic spread in cancer patients. Here, we investigated the release of miR-424 in circulating small EVs or exosomes from prostate cancer patients and assessed the functional implications in multiple experimental models. We found higher frequency of circulating miR-424 positive EVs in patients with metastatic prostate cancer compared to patients with primary tumors and BPH. Release of miR-424 in small EVs was enhanced in cell lines (LNCaPabl), transgenic mice (Pb-Cre4;Ptenflox/flox;Rosa26ERG/ERG) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of aggressive disease. EVs containing miR-424 promoted stem-like traits and tumor-initiating properties in normal prostate epithelial cells while enhanced tumorigenesis in transformed prostate epithelial cells. Intravenous administration of miR-424 positive EVs to mice, mimicking blood circulation, promoted miR-424 transfer and tumor growth in xenograft models. Circulating miR-424 positive EVs from patients with aggressive primary and metastatic tumors induced stem-like features when supplemented to prostate epithelial cells. This study establishes that EVs-mediated transfer of miR-424 across heterogeneous cell populations is an important mechanism of tumor self-sustenance, disease recurrence and progression. These findings might indicate novel approaches for the management and therapy of prostate cancer. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Ten significant correlations between echotextural attributes and various meat characteristics were recorded in Group C, one in Group Exp1, and eight in Group Exp2. When data were pooled for all birds studied, there were twelve significant correlations (p < 0.05); all but one correlation (between MPH and moisture) were for physical and sensory characteristics of meat samples.

	abstract = {Family Flaviviridae, which encompasses several small dreadful viruses under its canopy has been a big challenge for human health globally.. With four genera and 89 species the family has drawn attention due to its genus Flavivirus known for its significant pathogenic members such as yellow fever virus (YFV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis Virus (JEV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV).These viruses are lipid enveloped and have small (+) ssRNA genome of approximately 11 Kb with a single Open Reading Frame (ORF), coding for three structural and seven non-structural proteins. The members of this genus exhibit receptor mediated endocytosis for accessing the host cells and upon successful entry, they undergo replication using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a trait possessed by all riboviruses. Their high mutation rate leads to significant genetic diversity within the species; therefore designing specific antiviral drug(s) remains a challenge. Complexity also arises due to the spread of these viruses using vectors in their transmission cycles; arthropods being on the top notch among the vectors. Majority of them exploit mosquitos as their carriers and humans as their hosts, therefore global warming and human travel across the continents have aggravated their spread to other parts of the world, shifting their status from epidemic to pandemic. Although effective vaccine development is the need of the hour for the control of this group of viruses, but vector control seems to be the only plausible solution in current scenario so that their human transmissions can be controlled. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {Several precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies, conceived for optimizing farming processes, are developed to detect the physical and behavioral changes of animals continuously and in real-time. The aim of this review was to explore the capacity of existing PLF technologies to contribute to the assessment of pig welfare. In a web search for commercially available PLF for pigs, 83 technologies were identified. A literature search was conducted, following systematic review guidelines (PRISMA), to identify studies on the validation of sensor technologies for assessing animal-based welfare indicators. Two validation levels were defined: internal (evaluation during system building within the same population that were used for system building) and external (evaluation on a different population than during system building). From 2,463 articles found, 111 were selected, which validated some PLF that could be applied to the assessment of animal-based welfare indicators of pigs (7% classified as external, and 93% as internal validation). From our list of commercially available PLF technologies, only 5% had been externally validated. The more often validated technologies were vision-based solutions (n = 45), followed by load-cells (n = 28; feeders and drinkers, force plates and scales), accelerometers (n = 14) and microphones (n = 14), thermal cameras (n = 10), photoelectric sensors (n = 5), radio-frequency identification (RFID) for tracking (n = 2), infrared thermometers (n = 1), and pyrometer (n = 1). Externally validated technologies were photoelectric sensors (n = 2), thermal cameras (n = 2), microphone (n = 1), load-cells (n = 1), RFID (n = 1), and pyrometer (n = 1). Measured traits included activity and posture-related behavior, feeding and drinking, other behavior, physical condition, and health. In conclusion, existing PLF technologies are potential tools for on-farm animal welfare assessment in pig production. However, validation studies are lacking for an important percentage of market available tools, and in particular research and development need to focus on identifying the feature candidates of the measures (e.g., deviations from diurnal pattern, threshold levels) that are valid signals of either negative or positive animal welfare. An important gap identified are the lack of technologies to assess affective states (both positive and negative states). © Copyright © 2021 Gómez, Stygar, Boumans, Bokkers, Pedersen, Niemi, Pastell, Manteca and Llonch.},

	abstract = {Targeted gene flow (TGF) could bolster the adaptive potential of isolated populations threatened by climate change, but could also lead to outbreeding depression. Here, we explore these possibilities by creating mixed- and within-population crosses in a terrestrial-breeding frog species threatened by a drying climate. We reared embryos of the crawling frog (Pseudophryne guentheri) on wet and dry soils and quantified fitness-related traits upon hatching. TGF produced mixed outcomes in hybrids, which depended on crossing direction (origin of gametes from each sex). North-south crosses led to low embryonic survival if eggs were of a southern origin, and high malformation rates when eggs were from a northern population. Conversely, east-west crosses led to one instance of hybrid vigour, evident by increased fitness and desiccation tolerance of hybrid offspring relative to offspring produced from within-population crosses. These contrasting results highlight the need to experimentally evaluate the outcomes of TGF for focal species across generations prior to implementing management actions. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Heat stress is one of the most detrimental environmental challenges affecting the biological process and the related production performance of farm animals, especially in poultry. Commercial laying hens have been bred (selected) for high egg production, resulting in increased sensitivity to heat stress due to breeding-linked metabolic heat production. In addition, laying hens are prone to heat stress due to their inadequate species-specific cooling mechanisms resulting in low heat tolerance. In addition, hens have no sweat glands and feathering covers almost their entire body to minimize body heat loss. The poultry industry and scientists are developing cooling methods to prevent or reduce heat stress-caused damage to chicken health, welfare, and economic losses. We have designed and tested a cooling system using perches, in which chilled water (10 °C) circulates through a conventional perch passing through the layer cages to offer the cooling potential to improve hen health, welfare, and performance during acute and chronic periods of heat stress (35 °C). This review summarizes the outcomes of a multi-year study using the designed cooled perch system. The results indicate that conducting heat from perching hens directly onto the cooled perch system efficiently reduces heat stress and related damage in laying hens. It provides a novel strategy: perches, one key furnishment in cage-free and enriched colony facilities, could be modified as cooling devices to improve thermal comfort for hens during hot seasons, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe the morphology and means of identification of helminths in native partridges (65) and introduced pheasants (32) in Poland and to determine the level of intestinal infection of these birds by helminths using parasitological and ecological indices. The birds were acquired during the hunting season in the years 2015–2017. Nematodes, Capillaria phasianina, cestodes, Railietina friedbergeri, and one trematode, Brachylaima sp. were recorded for the first time in partridges in Poland. Our findings indicate that parasites are more prevalent in pheasants (prevalence 70.4%) than in partridges (prevalence 50.0%). The component community and infracommunity of parasites of partridges are more diverse (Simpson’s diversity index: 0.63 and mean Brillouin diversity index: 0.10 ± 0.17) and less dominated by a single parasite species (Capillaria sp., Berger-Parker dominance index: 0.53) than the pheasant parasite community (Simpson’s diversity index: 0.07, mean Brillouin diversity index: 0.005 ± 0.02, dominant species Heterakis gallinarum, Berger-Parker dominance index: 0.96). There were statistically significant differences between partridges and pheasants in the Brillouin diversity index and in the prevalence of Heterakis gallinarum (55.6% in pheasants vs. 19.0 in partridges). There were significant differences between wild and farmed partridges in the prevalence of infection by Capillaria sp. (4.3% vs. 37.5%) and H. gallinarum (39.1 vs. 6.2%). In conclusion, the pheasant was shown to be a reservoir, carrier, and shedder of nematodes, which may increase the risk of infection in partridges. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Modelling the invasion and emergence of forest pests and pathogens (PnPs) is necessary to quantify the risk levels for forest health and provide key information for policy makers. Here, we make a short review of the models used to quantify the invasion risk of exotic species and the emergence risk of native species. Regarding the invasion process, models tackle each invasion phase, e.g. pathway models to describe the risk of entry, species distribution models to describe potential establishment, and dispersal models to describe (human-assisted) spread. Concerning the emergence process, models tackle each process: spread or outbreak. Only a few spread models describe jointly dispersal, growth, and establishment capabilities of native species while some mechanistic models describe the population temporal dynamics and inference models describe the probability of outbreak. We also discuss the ways to quantify uncertainty and the role of machine learning. Overall, promising directions are to increase the models' genericity by parameterization based on meta-analysis techniques to combine the effect of species traits and various environmental drivers. Further perspectives consist in considering the models' interconnection, including the assessment of the economic impact and risk mitigation options, as well as the possibility of having multi-risks and the reduction in uncertainty by collecting larger fit-for-purpose datasets.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

Methods: From the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results, there were no difference in functional groups between four chitosan/PCL samples with variations in PCL concentration. They were all non toxic due to cytotoxicity assay. Results: The addition of PCL concentration also decreases the samples degradation rate but increases the sample contact angle. Conclusion: Based on these results, chitosan/PCL composites can be product innovation for skin tissue engineering based on the characteristics of fiber size, tensile strength, degradation rate, and biocompatibility. © 2021 UPM Press.

	abstract = {Long-term population trends are considerable sources of information to set wildlife conservation priorities and to evaluate the performance of management actions. In addition, trends observed in functional groups (e.g., trophic guilds) can provide the foundation to test specific hypotheses about the drivers of the observed population dynamics. The aims of this study were to assess population trends of breeding birds in Lombardy (N Italy) from 1992 to 2019 and to explore the relationships between trends and species sharing similar ecological and life history traits. Trends were quantified and tested for significance by weighted linear regression models and using yearly population indices (median and 95% confidence interval) predicted through generalized additive models. Results showed that 45% of the species increased, 24% decreased, and 31% showed nonsignificant trends. Life history traits analyses revealed a general decrease of migrants, of species with short incubation period and of species with high annual fecundity. Ecological traits analyses showed that plant-eaters and species feeding on invertebrates, farmland birds, and ground-nesters declined, while woodland birds increased. Further studies should focus on investigation of the relationship between long-term trends and species traits at large spatial scales, and on quantifying the effects of specific drivers across multiple functional groups. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Livestock radiated out from domestication centres to most regions of the world, gradually adapting to diverse environments, from very hot to sub‐zero temperatures and from wet and humid conditions to deserts. The climate is changing; generally global temperature is increasing, although there are also more extreme cold periods, storms, and higher solar radiation. These changes impact livestock welfare and productivity. This review describes advances in the methodology for studying livestock genomes and the impact of the environment on animal production, giving examples of discoveries made. Sequencing livestock genomes has facilitated genome‐wide association studies to localize genes controlling many traits, and population genetics has identified genomic regions under selection or introgressed from one breed into another to improve production or facilitate adaptation. Landscape genomics, which combines global positioning and genomics, has identified genomic features that enable animals to adapt to local environments. Combining the advances in genomics and methods for predicting changes in climate is generating an explosion of data which calls for innovations in the way big data sets are treated. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are now being used to study the interactions between the genome and the environment to identify historic effects on the genome and to model future scenarios. © 2021 by the authors.

This study proposed to carry out a meta-analysis to obtain estimates of heritability and genetic correlations for 35 traits, including growth, reproductive, resistance to parasites, wool, and carcass related traits. A total of 191 articles, 505 heritability coefficients, and 356 genetic correlations were evaluated using a random model. The meta-analysis estimated heritability ranging from 0.1213 to 0.3912 for growth traits, from 0.0398 to 0.3047 for reproductive traits, 0.1724 to 0.2582 for resistance to nematodes traits, 0.3616 to 0.5808 for wool traits, and from 0.2063 to 0.3299 for carcass traits. The estimates of genetic correlations were mainly positive and ranged from 0.2500 to 0.9665, except for eggs per gram of feces with body weight (-0.18) and with hematocrit (-0.48). The genetic parameters estimated in the present study can be used in breeding programs under the most different environmental conditions, as they were obtained through many studies with different situations. Thus, these results can support the development of sheep breeding programs, especially in developing and underdeveloped countries, where sheep farming is an important agricultural activity. © 2021},

	abstract = {Gainful livestock farming requires selective breeding of animals with certain heritable desirable traits which gives profitability in terms of farm produce. Modern dairy animals are selected for traits which directly or indirectly contribute to high milk production. The concept of “feed conversion efficiency” in terms of milk production is now vigorously taken up by researchers and farm managers for recognizing and breeding efficient milk-producing animals. The whole concept of economic farming thus requires identification of “elite” animals, meeting above criteria as base population for the farm enterprise. Farmers and animal traders have been selecting best animals based on certain physical characters, which were also accepted by the breeding scientists as phenotypes. Data mining allows uncovering of hidden patterns in the data for better understanding of data relationship for developing suitable models for further improvements. Along with artificial intelligence techniques, data mining has opened new avenues for achieving high resource utilization efficiency and sustainable profitability in livestock production systems. The present review discusses and summarizes various data mining techniques and decision support systems for scientific dairy farming. Copyright: Balhara, et al. Open Access.

	abstract = {Cancer progression involves multiple genetic and epigenetic events, which involve gain-of-functions of oncogenes and loss-of-functions of tumor suppressor genes. Classical tumor suppressor genes are recessive in nature, anti-proliferative, and frequently found inactivated or mutated in cancers. However, extensive research over the last few years have elucidated that certain tumor suppressor genes do not conform to these standard definitions and might act as “double agents”, playing contrasting roles in vivo in cells, where either due to haploinsufficiency, epigenetic hyperme-thylation, or due to involvement with multiple genetic and oncogenic events, they play an enhanced proliferative role and facilitate the pathogenesis of cancer. This review discusses and highlights some of these exceptions; the genetic events, cellular contexts, and mechanisms by which four important tumor suppressors—pRb, PTEN, FOXO, and PML display their oncogenic potentials and pro-survival traits in cancer. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Cow longevity is recognized as an important trait to improve farm economic performance while concurrently reducing environmental and social impacts. However, there is an economic trade-off between longevity and herd genetic improvement, which may influence the dairy farms’ efficiency and productivity growth over time. This study used a panel data of 723 Dutch specialized dairy farms over 2007-2013 to empirically measure the effect of longevity on dynamic productivity change and its components. First, the productivity growth estimates were obtained using the Luenberger dynamic productivity indicator. Then, the estimates were regressed on longevity and other explanatory variables using dynamic panel data model. Results show that the average dynamic productivity growth was 1.1% per year, comprising of technical change (0.5%), scale inefficiency change (0.4%) and technical inefficiency change (0.2%). Longevity is found to have a statistically significant positive association with productivity growth and technical change, implying that farms with more matured cows were also those farms that recorded increased productivity through technical progress. However, it has a negative association with technical inefficiency change, which might follow from the reduced milk productivity of old cows per unit of inputs used. Dutch dairy farms have a potential to raise productivity growth by reducing technical inefficiencies associated with input utilization. © 2021},

	abstract = {The objective of changing the simple exploitation of fish stocks to highly efficient fish farms in lakes and reservoirs is to improve the productivity of inland freshwater fish. The small- and medium-sized lakes can be used to increase the production of farmed fish with lake management. Therefore, this study proposed to investigate the production and economic efficiency of carp in lake commercial fish farms. In this investigation, the results of carp farming experiments in fish farms in small lake commercial fish farms (LCFF) are evaluated using advanced methods and techniques. The research was carried out based on the Voroshilovsky reservoir, which operated in the LCFF mode. The farm had hatchery and carp fry ponds for expanding fingerlings based on the "Scientific and production center of fishery" LLP from 2019 to 2020. This study was performed on different types of common carp and herbivorous fish (grass and silver carp), and sexual products were collected in fried ponds and the Voroshilovsky reservoir. The absolute growth gain of common carp, silver carp, and grass carp were 301.00, 300.40, and 577.00 grams, respectively, and their mean daily weight gain values were 2.50, 2.50, and 4.80 grams. Common carp recorded the highest level of planned fish productivity (169.30 kg/ha), and the lowest level of this trait was grass carp (43.50 kg/ha). Data of mean weight and body length of common carp, grass carp, and silver carp fishes showed a variation of 4.55 kg and 56.25 cm, 6.06 kg and 75.50 cm, as well as 6.30 Kg and 75.05 cm, respectively. This difference can be justified according to the variance of fish length, which on average, 80 grams of weight is obtained per centimeter of fish length. The economic efficiency of carp was calculated, and the net profit was determined at more than 50% of total income. According to the net profit indicator, due to the implementation of a part of the fingerlings, the carp reared in the pond area; as a result, this method is profitable and accounts for 104% of the total planned economic profit. Therefore, fish production from aquaculture can rise to 10 times to maintain high-quality food security and other essential nutrients, provide job opportunities, and cash income to help job-seeking youth. © 2021 Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to detect an impact of age on semen quality was studied in healthy nonsmoking men exposed to traffic air pollution. Methods: Semen samples from 150 Prague City policemen aged 23 to 63 years were examined for standard semen parameters, sperm DNA fragmentation and high DNA stainability. Results: A significant positive correlation was found between age and %DFI (r =.359, P <.001), and negative correlations were found between age and sperm vitality (r = −.247, P <.001), the % acrosome-intact sperm (r = −.202, P =.013) and the % normal sperm heads (r = −.204, P =.012). A weak but significant negative correlation was found for high DNA stainability (% HDS) vs age (r = −.161, P =.050). No significant correlation was detected between male age and the other investigated semen quality parameters. At ages of 23 to 30, 31 to 40, 41 to 50, and 51 to 63 years, the mean %DFI values were 12.7 ± 7.18, 14.7 ± 7.42, 19.6 ± 11.25, and 34.2 ± 15.08, respectively. Conclusion: Our study shows a strong relationship (P <.001) between the age of men and sperm DNA fragmentation in an occupational cohort at risk of exposure to heavy traffic-related air pollution in a large city center. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {Extreme environmental conditions, such as temperature, can lead to meristic trait variation and skeletal deformities, which may have major impacts on individual fitness. As intertidal ecosystems experience rapid temperature and physicochemical fluctuations, intertidal fish living and reproducing in these environmental conditions may have phenotypes influenced by such variable environments. The impact of intertidal variability on fish development, however, has not been previously investigated. Skeletal deformities and meristic traits were assessed for Bathygobius cocosensis, a common intertidal fish living across the Indo-Pacific region, using a clearing and staining method on 72 individuals. Over 87% of individuals presented meristic variation and over 70% exhibited at least one type of skeletal deformity, mostly recorded in the caudal fin area. The unexpected prevalence of skeletal deformities among this intertidal fish population suggests that such deformities may be suitable markers to evaluate an individual's stress exposure during development and the subsequent fitness effects. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Corymbia is grown for timber, pulp and paper, and essential oils in Australia, South Africa, Asia, and Brazil, maintaining a high-growth rate under marginal conditions due to drought, poor-quality soil, and biotic stresses. To dissect the genetic basis of these desirable traits, we sequenced and assembled the 408 Mb genome of Corymbia citriodora, anchored into eleven chromosomes. Comparative analysis with Eucalyptus grandis reveals high synteny, although the two diverged approximately 60 million years ago and have different genome sizes (408 vs 641 Mb), with few large intra-chromosomal rearrangements. C. citriodora shares an ancient whole-genome duplication event with E. grandis but has undergone tandem gene family expansions related to terpene biosynthesis, innate pathogen resistance, and leaf wax formation, enabling their successful adaptation to biotic/abiotic stresses and arid conditions of the Australian continent. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: In diploid organisms, whole-genome haplotype assembly relies on the accurate identification and assignment of heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles to the correct homologous chromosomes. This appropriate phasing of these alleles ensures that combinations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on any chromosome, called haplotypes, can then be used in downstream genetic analysis approaches including determining their potential association with important phenotypic traits. A number of statistical algorithms and complementary computational software tools have been developed for whole-genome haplotype construction from genomic sequence data. However, many algorithms lack the ability to phase long haplotype blocks and simultaneously achieve a competitive accuracy. Results: In this research we present HaploMaker, a novel reference-based haplotype assembly algorithm capable of accurately and efficiently phasing long haplotypes using paired-end short reads and longer Pacific Biosciences reads from diploid genomic sequences. To achieve this we frame the problem as a directed acyclic graph with edges weighted on read evidence and use efficient path traversal and minimization techniques to optimally phase haplotypes. We compared the HaploMaker algorithm with 3 other common reference-based haplotype assembly tools using public haplotype data of human individuals from the Platinum Genome project. With short-read sequences, the HaploMaker algorithm maintained a competitively low switch error rate across all haplotype lengths and was superior in phasing longer genomic regions. For longer Pacific Biosciences reads, the phasing accuracy of HaploMaker remained competitive for all block lengths and generated substantially longer block lengths than the competing algorithms. Conclusions: HaploMaker provides an improved haplotype assembly algorithm for diploid genomic sequences by accurately phasing longer haplotypes. The computationally efficient and portable nature of the Java implementation of the algorithm will ensure that it has maximal impact in reference-sequence-based haplotype assembly applications. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {RNA-Seq technology is widely used to analyze global changes in the transcriptome and investigate the influence on relevant phenotypic traits. Beijing Black pigs show differences in growth rate and meat quality compared to western pig breeds. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for such phenotypic differences remain unknown. In this study, longissimus dorsi muscles from Beijing Black and Yorkshire pigs were used to construct RNA libraries and perform RNA-seq. Significantly different expressions were observed in 1051 mRNAs, 322 lncRNAs, and 82 circRNAs. GO and KEGG pathway annotation showed that differentially expressed mRNAs participated in skeletal muscle development and fatty acid metabolism, which determined the muscle-related traits. To explore the regulatory role of lncRNAs, the cis and trans-target genes were predicted and these lncRNAswere involved in the biological processes related to skeletal muscle development and fatty acid metabolismvia their target genes. CircRNAs play a ceRNA role by binding to miRNAs. Therefore, the potential miRNAs of differentially expressed circRNAs were predicted and interaction networks among circRNAs, miRNAs, and key regulatory mRNAs were constructed to illustrate the function of circRNAs underlying skeletal muscle development and fatty acid metabolism. This study provides new clues for elucidating muscle phenotypic variation in pigs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

To date, the genus includes 28 species distributed worldwide in saline environments, usually salt marshes. Sarcocornia (Scott) is similar to Salicornia (L.), which has a recognized commercial value in morphological and taxonomical traits. Species of both genera are commonly named samphire or glassworts in Europe, and their fleshy shoots are commercialized under their traditional names. Due to their nutritional, organoleptic and medicinal properties, Sarcocornia species have a high economic potential in various biotechnology sectors. Being highly tolerant to salt, they can be cultivated in saline conditions, and dissimilar to Salicornia, they are perennial, i.e., they can be harvested year-round. Therefore, Sarcocornia species are considered promising gourmet vegetables to be explored in the context of climate change, soil and water salinization and eco-sustainability.

The tumor mass is comprised of a heterogeneous population of cells that include recruited host immune cells, stromal cells, matrix components, and endothelial cells. This tumor microenvironment plays a fundamental role in the acquisition of hallmark traits, and has been the intense focus of current research. A key regulatory mechanism triggered by these tumor–stroma interactions includes processes that resemble epithelial–mesenchymal transition, a physiologic program that allows a polarized epithelial cell to undergo biochemical and cellular changes and adopt mesenchymal cell characteristics. These cellular adaptations facilitate enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased production of ECM components. Indeed, it has been postulated that cancer cells undergo epithelial–mesenchymal transition to invade and metastasize. In the following discussion, the physiology of chronic inflammation, wound healing, fibrosis, and tumor invasion will be explored. The key regulatory cytokines, transforming growth factor β and osteopontin, and their roles in cancer metastasis will be highlighted. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The UK dairy herd is predominantly of the Holstein-Friesian (HF) breed, with a major emphasis placed on milk yield. Subsequently, following years of continued single-trait selection, the beef production potential of dairy bred calves has declined. Thus, male HF calves are commonly seen as a by-product of the dairy industry. Limited markets, perceived low economic value and high rearing costs mean that these surplus calves are often euthanised shortly after birth or exported to the EU for further production. Welfare concerns have been raised regarding both euthanasia and long distance transportation of these calves. Furthermore, total UK beef consumption increased by 8.5% from 2009 to 2019. Thus, in light of this growing demand, beef from the dairy herd could be better utilized within the UK. Therefore, the potential for these calves to be used in a sustainable, cost-effective beef production system with high welfare standards within the UK requires investigation. Thus, the aim of this review was to evaluate both steer and bull beef production systems, examining the impact on performance, health, welfare, and economic potential to enable a sustainable farming practice, while meeting UK market requirements. The principal conclusions from this review indicate that there is the potential for these calves to be used in UK based production systems and meet market requirements. Of the steer production systems, a 24 month system appears to achieve a balance between input costs, growth from pasture and carcass output, albeit the literature is undecided on the optimum system. The situation is similar for bull beef production systems, high input systems do achieve the greatest gain in the shortest period of time, however, these systems are not sustainable in volatile markets with fluctuating concentrate prices. Thus, again the inclusion of a grazing period, may increase the resilience of these systems. Furthermore, production systems incorporating a period at pasture are seen to have animal welfare benefits. The main welfare concern for surplus dairy bred calves is often poor colostrum management at birth. While in steer systems, consideration needs to be given to welfare regarding castration, with the negative impacts being minimized by completing this procedure soon after birth. © Copyright © 2021 Rutherford, Lively and Arnott.},

	abstract = {The demand for poultry meat, being cheaper than red meat, will drive worldwide production of this product. Accordingly, an increase in production up to 16% is expected in 2025, most of which will occur in developing countries. Most poultry meat production is realized with intensive production systems, and extensive rearing systems (ERS) of poultry (organic, free-range, and low-input) represent only a small portion of poultry production in the EU (about 5%). However, there is an increasing interest in such rearing systems to maintain the good image of product and environmental sustainability, improved animal welfare, and meat quality with an annual trend of growth of about 10%. The aims of this work were to summarize the activities and the viewpoint of the researchers of the Department of Agricultural, Food, and Environmental Science of the University of Perugia (Italy). One of the most important goals of the research unit was the challenge of identifying the best poultry genotypes for ERS, which are important not only for the food industry but also for the improvement of human nutrition. Only the definition of the best genotypes adapted to ERS through the measurement of a wide panel of traits—genetic, physiologic, and behavior—and not only relying on daily weight gain will allow us to achieve this goal. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Phosphorus (P), in its orthophosphate form (Pi) is an essential macronutrient for oil palm early growth development in which Pi deficiency could later on be reflected in lower biomass production. Application of phosphate rock, a non-renewable resource has been the common practice to increase Pi accessibility and maintain crop productivity in Malaysia. However, high fixation rate of Pi in the native acidic tropical soils has led to excessive utilization of P fertilizers. This has caused serious environmental pollutions and cost increment. Even so, the Pi deficiency response mechanism in oil palm as one of the basic prerequisites for crop improvement remains largely unknown. Results: Using total RNA extracted from young roots as template, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis on oil palm responding to 14d and 28d of Pi deprivation treatment and under adequate Pi supply. By using Illumina HiSeq4000 platform, RNA-Seq analysis was successfully conducted on 12 paired-end RNA-Seq libraries and generated more than 1.2 billion of clean reads in total. Transcript abundance estimated by fragments per kilobase per million fragments (FPKM) and differential expression analysis revealed 36 and 252 genes that are differentially regulated in Pi-starved roots at 14d and 28d, respectively. Genes possibly involved in regulating Pi homeostasis, nutrient uptake and transport, hormonal signaling and gene transcription were found among the differentially expressed genes. Conclusions: Our results showed that the molecular response mechanism underlying Pi starvation in oil palm is complexed and involved multilevel regulation of various sensing and signaling components. This contribution would generate valuable genomic resources in the effort to develop oil palm planting materials that possess Pi-use efficient trait through molecular manipulation and breeding programs. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA) and ocean warming (OW) are predicted to drive changes to the distribution of species and the structure of biological communities globally. Differences in life-history, physical traits, and the phenotypic response of organisms will, however, mean that the effects of OA and OW will differ among species. Geographical differences in environmental characteristics across habitats will also influence the effects of OA and OW, thereby driving inter-population differences in phenotypic response as determined by local adaptations. While is it accepted that the response of species will vary globally, predicting the trends in response of species remains highly uncertain. We undertook a meta-analysis of key biological traits of 47 marine copepod species from 88 studies to identify the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing the effects of OA and OW on copepod population demographics. Data from OA and OW were analysed independently due to insufficient two-stressor studies. We found that the large disparity in the response of species to OA and OW is largely defined by their environmental history. Additionally, the response of copepod species to OW is related to their evolutionary history which has less influence on their response to OA. Therefore, our study identified that the response of copepods to OA is driven by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors in their habitats. Under OA alone, copepods from less variable environments may be more susceptible, but the effects of OA will only be strongly negative at extreme low pH (7). On the other hand, the response to OW is deeply tied to their phylogeny, whereby closely related species share similar costs and trade-offs. However, the effects of near-future OW (+2 to 4°C) seem mainly positive unless these temperatures exceed a species' thermal limit. Finally, our analysis revealed that OW has a greater influence on key copepod traits than OA. Overall, this study shows that attempting to draw global patterns in the response of species to climate change from a single species or habitat without consideration of environmental and evolutionary history could lead to inaccurate and misleading predictions with respect to the future of biological communities. © 2021 CRC Press.

	abstract = {The diet composition of ungulates is important to understand not only their impact on vegetation, but also to understand the consequences of natural and human‐driven environmental changes on the foraging behavior of these mammals. In this work, we evaluated the use of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy analysis (NIRS), a quick, economic and non‐destructive method, to assess the diet composition of the Pyrenean chamois Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica. Fecal samples (n = 192) were collected from two chamois populations in the French and Spanish Pyrenees. Diet composition was initially assessed by fecal cuticle microhistological analysis (CMA) and categorized into four functional groups, namely: woody, herbaceous, graminoid and Fabaceae plants. Regressions of modified partial least squares and several combinations of scattering correction and derivative treatments were tested. The results showed that models based on the second derivative processing obtained the higher determination coefficient for woody, herbaceous and graminoid plants (R2CAL, coefficient of determination in calibration, ranged from 0.86 to 0.91). The Fabaceae group, however, was predicted with lower accuracy (R2CAL = 0.71). Even though an agreement between NIRS and CMA methods was confirmed by a Bland–Altman analysis, confidence limits of agreement differed by up to 25%. Our results support the viability of fecal NIRS analysis to study spatial and temporal variations of the Pyrenean chamois’ diets in summer and winter when differences in the consumption of woody and annual plants are the greatest. This new use for the NIRS technique would be useful to assess the consequences of global change on the feeding behavior of this mountain ungulate and also in other ungulate counterparts. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Introduction ACOSOG-Z0011(Z11) trial showed that axillary node clearance (ANC) may be omitted in women with ≤2 positive nodes undergoing breast conserving surgery (BCS) and whole breast radiotherapy (RT). A confirmatory study is needed to clarify the role of axillary treatment in women with ≤2 macrometastases undergoing BCS and groups that were not included in Z11 for example, mastectomy and those with microscopic extranodal invasion. The primary objective of POsitive Sentinel NOde: adjuvant therapy alone versus adjuvant therapy plus Clearance or axillary radiotherapy (POSNOC) is to evaluate whether for women with breast cancer and 1 or 2 macrometastases, adjuvant therapy alone is non-inferior to adjuvant therapy plus axillary treatment, in terms of 5-year axillary recurrence. Methods and analysis POSNOC is a pragmatic, multicentre, non-inferiority, international trial with participants randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Women are eligible if they have T1/T2, unifocal or multifocal invasive breast cancer, and 1 or 2 macrometastases at sentinel node biopsy, with or without extranodal extension. In the intervention group women receive adjuvant therapy alone, in the standard care group they receive ANC or axillary RT. In both groups women receive adjuvant therapy, according to local guidelines. This includes systemic therapy and, if indicated, RT to breast or chest wall. The UK Radiotherapy Trials Quality Assurance Group manages the in-built radiotherapy quality assurance programme. Primary endpoint is 5-year axillary recurrence. Secondary outcomes are arm morbidity assessed by Lymphoedema and Breast Cancer Questionnaire and QuickDASH questionnaires; quality of life and anxiety as assessed with FACT B+4 and State/Trait Anxiety Inventory questionnaires, respectively; other oncological outcomes; economic evaluation using EQ-5D-5L. Target sample size is 1900. Primary analysis is per protocol. Recruitment started on 1 August 2014 and as of 9 June 2021, 1866 participants have been randomised.

The daily records of milk yield were collected in the south-west of Iran where buffalo experienced a hot climate. The data set was constructed with 8,123 records of 1,430 first lactation buffalo. A univariate random regression model (RR/CF) was applied to data. Regression of additive genetic effect based on Legendre polynomials from the day of lactation was considered in the model. The results showed that maximum residual variance for the milk and fat production was estimated at the beginning of the lactation period. The minimum amount of additive genetic variation of milk and fat traits was seen in the early lactation period and the maximum amount of the component was estimated at the end of the lactation period. The lowest heritability of the mentioned traits was at the beginning of the lactation period. The level of this parameter increased to mid-lactation and was at its maximum during the late months of lactation, then decreased to the end of lactation. The estimated additive genetic correlations between close test-days were higher than faraway test-day records for each milk yield and milk fat content. Based on the results of this study, a random regression model with fitting orders 3 and 4, seems to be suitable for additive covariance functions in order to analyze the milk test-day records of buffaloes. © 2022, Kasetsart University.

The meat quality of cocks and its acceptance by the consumer is important for its propagation as dual purpose variety. The two way cross produced by PD-1 x PD-4 (improved Aseel) was evaluated for growth, carcass and meat quality. Metohds: The growth, carcass and meat quality traits were evaluated in a two way cross developed and propagated for rural poultry farming at ICAR-Directorate of Poultry Research, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad, Telangana. The data collected on 232 birds for growth, 40 birds for carcass and 20 birds for meat quality were utilized for the study. Result: The body weight and shank length significantly (P≤0.05) differed between the sexes from six weeks onwards with higher (P≤0.05) body weights and longer shanks in males. The six week body weight and shank length were 578.23±8.22g and 78.93±6.22 mm in males and 548.28±7.20 g and 76.15±5.28 mm in females, respectively. The Least squares means for body weight at 12 weeks of age in males and females were 1652.61±21.49 and 1367.86 ±14.99 g, respectively. Males had strong legs with significantly (P≤0.05) high proportion of thigh meat. The effect of sex was non-significant on Dressing percentage (DP), neck, back and breast meat proportions. The DP was 71.12±0.22% in males and 72.51±0.43% in females, respectively. The bone proportion was higher (P≤0.05) in males. Abdominal fat proportion was significantly (P≤0.05) higher in pullets. Feather proportion was higher (P≤0.05) in males. Sex did not show any significant variation on the pH, Shear force value (SFV) and Hydroxy Proline (HP) values. The yellowness (b*) differed (P≤0.05) between the sexes and it was lower in males. The fat and moisture content differed significantly (P≤0.05) between the sexes. Fat proportion was higher (P≤0.05) in females (3.57±0.05) than in males (2.97±0.01). Protein and ash proportions were similar in both the sexes. The sensory attributes ranged from 6.55 to 7.15 on an eight point scale in two-way cross meat indicating better consumer acceptability. The study concluded that, two-way cross with ideal growth, carcass and optimum meat quality and reasonable consumer acceptability may be a suitable variety for propagating in rural and tribal areas under free range backyard conditions. © 2021 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Introduction: Although sleep disturbances are well documented in bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs), significantly less research has examined whether these disturbances are present in those at risk for developing BSDs or with subsyndromal symptoms. The present study examined associations between risk for BSDs, as measured by the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS), and sleep assessed using experience sampling. We assessed whether intraindividual variability in sleep was associated with affect, cognition, and behavior in daily life and potential directionality of these relationships. Methods: 233 young adults oversampled for high scores on the HPS completed 14 days of experience sampling assessing total sleep time (TST), bed/rise time, sleep quality, affect (negative and positive affect), cognition (difficulty concentrating, racing thoughts), and behavior (impulsivity) in daily life. We used Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM) to assess within-person links between sleep and bipolar spectrum psychopathology. Results: HPS scores were associated with less TST, later bedtime, and more variable TST and bedtime. Variability in TST was associated with negative affect, difficulty concentrating/racing thoughts, and impulsivity. Within-person decreases in sleep were associated with next day increases in negative affect, stress, difficulty concentrating, and racing thoughts. Limitations: Measurement of sleep was limited. Future studies should examine both objective measures of sleep (e.g., actigraphy) and fragmentation in sleep. Conclusions: Risk for BSD was associated with similar patterns of sleep disruptions as seen in BSDs. Important dynamic links between sleep and bipolar spectrum psychopathology emerged indicating that sleep is an important target for improving symptoms of BSDs in daily life. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Infertility is one of the important problems in the modern world. Male infertility is characterized by several clinical manifestations, including low sperm production (oligozoospermia), reduced sperm motility (asthenozoospermia), and abnormal sperm morphology (teratozoospermia). WDR4, known as Wuho, controls fertility in Drosophila. However, it is unclear whether WDR4 is associated with clinical manifestations of male fertility in human. Here, we attempted to determine the physiological functions of WDR4 gene. Two cohorts were applied to address this question. The first cohort was the general population from Taiwan Biobank. Genomic profiles from 68,948 individuals and 87 common physiological traits were applied for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). The second cohort comprised patients with male infertility from Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University. In total, 81 male participants were recruited for the genetic association study. Clinical records including gender, age, total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), total sperm number, sperm motility, and sperm morphology were collected. In the first cohort, results from PheWAS exhibited no associations between WDR4 genetic variants and 87 common physiological traits. In the second cohort, a total of four tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) from WDR4 gene (rs2298666, rs465663, rs2248490, and rs3746939) were selected for genotyping. We found that SNP rs465663 solely associated with asthenozoospermia. Functional annotations through the GTEx portal revealed the correlation between TT or TC genotype and low expression of WDR4. Furthermore, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts cells from mwdr4 heterozygous (+/-) mice for functional validation by western blotting. Indeed, low expression of WDR4 contributed to ROS-induced DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, our results suggest a critical role of WDR4 gene variant as well as protein expression in asthenozoospermia. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The tropical forests of Central America serve a pivotal role as biodiversity hotspots and provide ecosystem services securing human livelihood. However, climate change is expected to affect the species composition of forest ecosystems, lead to forest type transitions and trigger irrecoverable losses of habitat and biodiversity. Here, we investigate potential impacts of climate change on the environmental suitability of main plant functional types (PFTs) across Central America. Using a large database of occurrence records and physiological data, we classify tree species into trait-based groups and project their suitability under three representative concentration pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5) with an ensemble of state-of-the-art correlative modelling methods. Our results forecast transitions from wet towards generalist or dry forest PFTs for large parts of the study region. Moreover, suitable area for wet-adapted PFTs is projected to latitudinally diverge and lose connectivity, while expected upslope shifts of montane species point to high risks of mountaintop extinction. These findings underline the urgent need to safeguard the connectivity of habitats through biological corridors and extend protected areas in the identified transition hotspots. © 2021, The Author(s).},

As light pollution continues to grow in spatial, spectral, and temporal extent, we recognize the urgent need to understand how this affects circadian physiology, organismal fitness, life history traits and tradeoffs, population trends, and community interactions. Here, we aim to highlight background and foundational evidence of the effects of light pollution to present context and the basis for early light pollution studies. Next, we touch on several understudied topics where research is underway to fill gaps in our knowledge and provide the basis for future research. Last, we focus on questions that are vital to understanding the effects of ALAN on diverse natural systems and discuss the barriers we face conducting research on light pollution. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

	abstract = {Background: Shrimp aquaculture has suffered huge economic losses over the past decade due to the outbreak of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), which is mainly caused by the bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) with the virulence pVA1 plasmid, which encodes a secretory photorhabdus insect-related (Pir) toxin composed of PirA and PirB proteins. The Pir toxin mainly attacks the hepatopancreas, a major metabolic organ in shrimp, thereby causing necrosis and loss of function. The pandemic of antibiotic-resistant strains makes the impact worse. Methods: Mild pyrolysis of a mixture of polysaccharide dextran 70 and the crosslinker 1,8-diaminooctane at 180 ℃ for 3 h to form carbonized nanogels (DAO/DEX-CNGs) through controlled cross-linking and carbonization. The multifunctional therapeutic CNGs inherit nanogel-like structures and functional groups from their precursor molecules. Results: DAO/DEX-CNGs manifest broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Vibrio parahaemolyticus responsible for AHPND and even multiple drug-resistant strains. The polymer-like structures and functional groups on graphitic-carbon within the CNGs exhibit multiple treatment effects, including disruption of bacterial membranes, elevating bacterial oxidative stress, and neutralization of PirAB toxins. The inhibition of Vibrio in the midgut of infected shrimp, protection of hepatopancreas tissue from Pir toxin, and suppressing overstimulation of the immune system in severe V. parahaemolyticus infection, revealing that CNGs can effectively guard shrimp from Vibrio invasion. Moreover, shrimps fed with DAO/DEX-CNGs were carefully examined, such as the expression of the immune-related genes, hepatopancreas biopsy, and intestinal microbiota. Few adverse effects on shrimps were observed. Conclusion: Our work proposes brand-new applications of multifunctional carbon-based nanomaterials as efficient anti-Vibrio agents in the aquatic industry that hold great potential as feed additives to reduce antibiotic overuse in aquaculture.

A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and emergence of metastatic, therapy-resistant breast cancers would help development of novel approaches to better treatment of this disease. The review is dedicated to the role of members of the heat shock protein 70 subfamily (HSP70s or HSPA), mainly inducible HSP70, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78 or HSPA5) and GRP75 (HSPA9 or mortalin), in the development and pathogenesis of breast cancer. Various HSP70-mediated cellular mechanisms and pathways which contribute to the oncogenic transformation of mammary gland epithelium are reviewed, as well as their role in the development of human breast carcinomas with invasive, metastatic traits along with the resistance to host immunity and conventional therapeutics. Additionally, intracellular and cell surface HSP70s are considered as potential targets for therapy or sensitization of breast cancer. We also discuss a clinical implication of Hsp70s and approaches to targeting breast cancer with gene vectors or nanoparticles downregulating HSP70s, natural or synthetic (small molecule) inhibitors of HSP70s, HSP70-binding antibodies, HSP70-derived peptides, and HSP70-based vaccines. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: Emergency department (ED) health care providers had one of the highest incidences of burnout just before the pandemic. Personality type influences the way we communicate and relate to others, as well as our reaction to stress. In evaluating the causes of burnout, we take into account several factors, the most important of which being the conditions of the professional environment, interpersonal relationships and personality traits. This study aims to identify and analyze the relationships between personality traits and burnout syndrome in medical staff in the Emergency Department. Material and Methods: A descriptive, multicenter cross-sectional study project was used to collect data from 60 physicians and nurses from the Emergency Department of the County Emergency Clinical Hospital Galati. The tools used, distributed to participants to collect socio-demographic details, included the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI), and a pilot questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 11 questions, concerning exhaustion level, and focused on stress-generating elements and emotional management in the Emergency Department during the pandemic. Results: A large percentage of doctors in ED (45.8%) (n = 24) indicated a high level of exhaustion, while only 30.6% (n = 36) of nurses indicated a high level of exhaustion. Physicians displayed a higher level of stress than nurses, with 66.6% (n = 24) of physicians indicating an increased level of stress, compared to only 36.1% (n = 36) of nurses. A large percentage of nurses indicated a high level of depression (36.1%), whereas only 25% of Emergency Department physicians indicated a high level of depression. Discussion: The individuals with a melancholic and choleric temperament, as rated by the EPI, appeared more susceptible to developing burnout syndrome. The indication of instability or neuroticism appears to enhance the occurrence of burnout syndrome. There was also a correlation between extraversion and a high level of burnout, with extraverted individuals more easily reaching a high level of burnout. Conclusion: The results indicate a greater occurrence of exhaustion and stress in Emergency Department physicians compared to nurses in the Emergency Department. From the results, we can propose that there is a relationship between the personality traits as measured by the EPI and the occurrence of burnout syndrome. These findings may help to understand the vulnerability of medical staff to burnout, and to pre-emptively support them to deal effectively with stressors in the work environment. © 2022 Moscu et al.},

	abstract = {Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is the emblematic palm of tropical coastal areas all around the globe. It provides vital resources to millions of farmers. In an effort to better understand its evolutionary history and to develop genomic tools for its improvement, a sequence draft was recently released. Here, we present a dense linkage map (8402 SNPs) aiming to assemble the large genome of coconut (2.42 Gbp, 2n = 32) into 16 pseudomolecules. As a result, 47% of the sequences (representing 77% of the genes) were assigned to 16 linkage groups and ordered. We observed segregation distortion in chromosome Cn15, which is a signature of strong selection among pollen grains, favouring the maternal allele. Comparing our results with the genome of the oil palm Elaeis guineensis allowed us to identify major events in the evolutionary history of palms. We find that coconut underwent a massive transposable element invasion in the last million years, which could be related to the fluctuations of sea level during the glaciations at Pleistocene that would have triggered a population bottleneck. Finally, to better understand the facultative halophyte trait of coconut, we conducted an RNA-seq experiment on leaves to identify key players of signaling pathways involved in salt stress response. Altogether, our findings represent a valuable resource for the coconut breeding community. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the present investigation, the Kuzi ducks of Odisha were studied with respect to different phenotypic traits and genetic parameters measured for Juvenile traits from 1,718 ducklings hatched in three hatches using 40 sires and 160 dams reared under standard management conditions. Fertility, hatchability, juvenile traits, body weight gains and plumage characteristics were recorded. Carcass characteristics of the drakes were also measured at 20 weeks of age. The average fertility was 75.42% and hatchability on total egg set and fertile egg set basis were 61.79 and 82.10%, respectively. The body weight between male and female showed sexual dimorphisms with respect to body weight and conformation traits from 4th week onwards in Kuzi ducks. The least square body weight recorded at 8 weeks of age in male, female and pooled over sexes were 1,388, 1,231 and 1,282 g, respectively. Heritability estimates for different juvenile traits were moderate to high in magnitude for the traits studied. Body weight recorded at 20 weeks of age was 1,818 g in male and 1,628 g in female. Total edible carcass yield was 76.48% at 20 weeks of age in male. Multi-colour is found to be dominant plumage colour. The study revealed that Kuzi ducks of Odisha have very good potential for duck farming in the country and the body weight of the duck may be improved by selection of the birds and the drake (male) may be used for meat purpose. The growth of the ducklings was very fast from 2 to 8 weeks of age. © 2022 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.},

The research of alternative protein sources to replace soy use, avoiding negative effects on in vivo performance and on the product’s quality, is an important issue. In this context, cardoon represents a non-OGM resilient crop that can be cultivated in marginal lands for extracting its seed oil (utilized for biodiesel and biodegradable bioplastic production) and whose and the residual meal from its seed oil (utilized for biodiesel and biodegradable bioplastic production) could be a suitable by-product for animal feeding, due to its fairly high protein content. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using cardoon meal as an innovative protein source during the Limousine bulls’ fattening period. Thirty-two bulls were divided into two groups and fed with a diet containing soybean meal (SG) or partially replacing soybean meal with cardoon meal as a protein source (CG), respectively. The feeding trial lasted about 11 months. Growth performances and meat physical–chemical traits were evaluated. No statistical differences in feed efficiency, average daily gain, or in the main meat quality indicators, as well as in fatty acid profiles were found among the groups. Therefore, cardoon meal could be considered as an alternative to soybean meal in fattening Limousine bulls in order to enhance the sustainability of the farming system. © 2021 by the authors.

We focused on specific mastitis pathogens and differential somatic cell fractions from 2198 udder quarters of 537 genotyped Holstein Friesian cows. The farming systems comprised compost-bedded pack and conventional cubicle barns. We developed a computer algorithm for genome-wide association studies allowing the estimation of main SNP effects plus consideration of SNPs by farming system interactions. With regard to the main effect, 35 significant SNPs were detected on 14 different chromosomes for the cell fractions and the pathogens. Six SNPs were significant for the interaction effect with the farming system for most of the udder health traits. We inferred two possible candidate genes based on significant SNP interactions. HEMK1 plays a role in the development of the immune system, depending on environmental stressors. CHL1 is regulated in relation to stress level and influences immune system mechanisms. The significant interactions indicate that gene activity can fluctuate depending on environmental stressors. Phenotypically, the prevalence of mastitis indicators differed between systems, with a notably lower prevalence of minor bacterial indicators in compost systems. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study evaluated the fish quality and the sensory differences of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and pike-perch (Sander lucioperca) from three different feeding groups, which were fed a commercially available industrial (standard) diet, a control diet, and a special microorganism-based feed mix. This feed mainly consisted of a mix made of Rhodotorula glutinis, Crypthecodinium cohnii, and Arthrospira sp. and had 50% less fish meal and fish oil compared to typical control diets. At the beginning, the pike-perch population was six months old, and the rainbow trout population was 15 months old. The feeding study duration was 16 weeks and every four weeks the growth performance and several morphometric parameters were recorded. Afterwards, sensory evaluation took place to identify possible trends. Sensory evaluation revealed that the rainbow trout groups did not show any significant differences to the standard and control fish fillets with regard to odor, texture, and taste. The effects on rainbow trout growth performances and carcass parameters were similar to the standard group. The feed mix was not optimal for pike-perch farming, which was also reflected by significantly adversely affected growth performance and carcass parameters. The sensorial evaluation showed an opposite trend: here, only small differences in the fillets from the feed mix and standard/control diet were observed. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study aimed to examine farm managers´ satisfaction, attitudes, personality traits and analyse the associations with dairy cow culling and longevity in large commercial dairy farms. Farm managers of 116 dairy herds rearing at least 100 cows in freestall barns were included. A questionnaire for the farm managers registered personal background information of respondent and included statements capturing their satisfaction, opinions and attitudes regarding dairy cow culling and longevity, farming in general, and a Ten Item Personality Inventory scoring. For each herd, the last 12 months cow culling rate (CR, excluding dairy sale) and herd mean age of culled cows (MAofCC) was obtained from the Estonian Livestock Performance Recording Ltd. A K-mean clustering algorithm was applied to subgroup farm managers based on their attitudes, opinions and personality traits. The yearly mean herd CR was 33.0% and MAofCC was 60.6 months. Farm managers´ were mostly dissatisfied with cow longevity and culling rates in their farms. Dissatisfaction with culling rates and longevity, priority for producing high milk yields over longevity and production-oriented attitude was associated with high culling rates and poor longevity. Farm managers' personality had an effect on herd culling rates and their attitudes explained one third of the variability of culling rates and longevity. Explaining the economic consequences of high culling rates and decreased longevity, improving the visibility of these parameters together with benchmarking could bring these issues into focus. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Ruminant supply chains contribute 5.7 gigatons of CO2-eq per annum, which represents approximately 80% of the livestock sector emissions. One of the largest sources of emission in the ruminant sector is methane (CH4), accounting for approximately 40% of the sectors total emissions. With climate change being a growing concern, emphasis is being put on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, including those from ruminant production. Various genetic and environmental factors influence cattle CH4 production, such as breed, genetic makeup, diet, management practices, and physiological status of the host. The influence of genetic variability on CH4 yield in ruminants indicates that genomic selection for reduced CH4 emissions is possible. Although the microbiology of CH4 production has been studied, further research is needed to identify key differences in the host and microbiome genomes and how they interact with one another. The advancement of “-omics” technologies, such as metabolomics and metagenomics, may provide valuable information in this regard. Improved understanding of genetic mechanisms associated with CH4 production and the interaction between the microbiome profile and host genetics will increase the rate of genetic progress for reduced CH4 emissions. Through a systems biology approach, various “-omics” technologies can be combined to unravel genomic regions and genetic markers associated with CH4 production, which can then be used in selective breeding programs. This comprehensive review discusses current challenges in applying genomic selection for reduced CH4 emissions, and the potential for “-omics” technologies, especially metabolomics and metagenomics, to minimize such challenges. The integration and evaluation of different levels of biological information using a systems biology approach is also discussed, which can assist in understanding the underlying genetic mechanisms and biology of CH4 production traits in ruminants and aid in reducing agriculture’s overall environmental footprint. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

	abstract = {Pre-slaughter fasting duration affect blood parameters related to stress and metabolism, decrease live and carcass weights and impact beef quality of cattle. In three experiments, 1100 steers and heifers, finished on feedlot or on pasture, were evaluated to assess the influence of the site and duration of fasting before slaughter on physiological, carcass and meat quality traits. Cattle were allocated to one of two fasting duration - long (23–29 h) or short (2–6 h) – and to one of two sites of fasting– farm or abattoir. All animals had access to water ad libitum until slaughter, except during transportation. Cattle were assigned to two (long fasting on abattoir/normal lairage time, short fasting on farm/minimal lairage time) or three (long fasting on abattoir/normal lairage time, short fasting on farm/minimal lairage time, long fasting on farm/minimal lairage time) treatments. Seventeen slaughters were considered in a randomized complete block design. There was no effect of the site of fasting on any variable. Cattle with short fasting duration had higher carcass weights and water consumption than those under long fasting duration. Haematocrit, globulin, total protein, and lactate dehydrogenase at the time of slaughter increased with fasting duration. There was no effect of the duration of fasting on blood ions, meat quality traits, urine pH, liver weight and volume, and skin dry matter. A reduction in the fasting duration returned to farmers and abattoirs 1.2% additional kilograms of carcass, suggesting an improvement in animal welfare according to a better hydration level of cattle at the time of slaughter. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A panel of forty eight future advanced lines with three productive checks was planted in three divergent trials under normal, drought and heat prone settings. The multivariate technique and stability analysis was subjected on drought and heat adaptive/ yield drivers traits. The late phenological traits such as canopy temperature and normalized difference vegetation index at anthesis (CTA and NIA) displayed higher interface proportion with lines as compared to early traits like canopy temperature at booting and normalized difference vegetation index at booting (CTB and NIB). The changes in CTA and NIA effectively represented changes in comparative water gratified (RWG) and yield (YLD) under heat and drought settings, respectively. Dumpy YLD with high RWG and CTA readings, high yield but occurrence of reduced canopy temperature and RWG value demonstrating lines had cooler canopy and water retention were more mutual in normal, drought and then heat settings, corre-spondingly. The cluster two and four delimited lines with high yield but exposed lesser CTB and CTA values and vice versa for RWG, NIB and NIA. Nine lines were common in all three settings. NIA, RWG and NIB had positive correlation with YLD in heat, drought and normal setting, respectively while CTB and CTA were somewhat negatively linked with yield in entire three settings. In heat CTA and CTB, in drought, RWG and YLD and in normal CTB and YLD was highest discerning while NIB in heat and drought and CTA in normal setting were least discriminating. Nine lines in normal, and eight lines each drought and heat three settings established conquests due to stable climax placed on joined equality lines dispersal on polygon. © 2022, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

	abstract = {Conifer-feeding bark beetles are important herbivores and decomposers in forest ecosystems. These species complete their life cycle in nutritionally poor substrates and some can kill enormous numbers of trees during population outbreaks. The Eurasian spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) can destroy >100 million m3 of spruce in a single year. We report a 236.8 Mb I. typographus genome assembly using PacBio long-read sequencing. The final phased assembly has a contig N50 of 6.65 Mb in 272 contigs and is predicted to contain 23,923 protein-coding genes. We reveal expanded gene families associated with plant cell wall degradation, including pectinases, aspartyl proteases, and glycosyl hydrolases. This genome sequence from the genus Ips provides timely resources to address questions about the evolutionary biology of the true weevils (Curculionidae), one of the most species-rich animal families. In forests of today, increasingly stressed by global warming, this draft genome may assist in developing pest control strategies to mitigate outbreaks. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The domestication process has resulted in profound changes in the reproductive physiology of the animals that might have affected the sperm characteristics and thus their sensitivity to handling and cryopreservation procedures. This work assesses the response of the sperm of domestic and wild ungulates to a cooling storage at 15°C for 20 h followed by incubation at 38.5°C, 5% CO2, for 2 h. In addition, this paper examines the most representative sperm traits to assess their responsiveness to these stress conditions. Sperm samples were collected from domestic and their wild ancestor species: ram, mouflon, buck, Iberian ibex, domestic boar, and wild boar. Sperm motility, viability, mitochondrial membrane status, DNA fragmentation, and reactive oxygen species production were evaluated at the beginning of the experiment, after 20 h of refrigeration at 15°C, and, finally, at 2 h of incubation at 38.5°C. Sperm from all domestic species (ram, buck, and domestic boar) suffered more stress than their wild relatives (mouflon, Iberian Ibex, and wild boar). In pigs, the percentage of intact mitochondria was lower in the domestic species compared to wild boar. In sheep, we found a higher reactive oxygen species production in rams, while in goats, the curvilinear velocity was lower in the domestic species. The PCA (principal components analysis) showed that the motility and their kinetic variables were the most represented variables in the principal components of all species, indicating that they are essential biomarkers for evaluating the stress response. Sperm viability was highlighted as a representative variable for evaluating the stress response in domestic boar, mouflon, ram, and ibex. © Copyright © 2021 O'Brien, García-Casado, Castaño, Toledano-Díaz, Bóveda and Santiago-Moreno.},

	abstract = {Currently, large volumes of data are being collected on farms using multimodal sensor technologies. These sensors measure the activity, housing conditions, feed intake, and health of farm animals. With traditional methods, the data from farm animals and their environment can be collected intermittently. However, with the advancement of wearable and non-invasive sensing tools, these measurements can be made in real-time for continuous quantitation relating to clinical bi-omarkers, resilience indicators, and behavioral predictors. The digital phenotyping of humans has drawn enormous attention recently due to its medical significance, but much research is still needed for the digital phenotyping of farm animals. Implications from human studies show great promise for the application of digital phenotyping technology in modern livestock farming, but these technologies must be directly applied to animals to understand their true capacities. Due to species-specific traits, certain technologies required to assess phenotypes need to be tailored efficiently and accurately. Such devices allow for the collection of information that can better inform farmers on aspects of animal welfare and production that need improvement. By explicitly addressing farm animals’ individual physiological and mental (affective states) needs, sensor-based digital pheno-typing has the potential to serve as an effective intervention platform. Future research is warranted for the design and development of digital phenotyping technology platforms that create shared data standards, metrics, and repositories. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Anthropogenically-driven climate warming is a hypothesized driver of animal body size reductions. Less understood are effects of other human-caused disturbances on body size, such as urbanization. We compiled 140,499 body size records of over 100 North American mammals to test how climate and human population density, a proxy for urbanization, and their interactions with species traits, impact body size. We tested three hypotheses of body size variation across urbanization gradients: urban heat island effects, habitat fragmentation, and resource availability. Our results demonstrate that both urbanization and temperature influence mammalian body size variation, most often leading to larger individuals, thus supporting the resource availability hypothesis. In addition, life history and other ecological factors play a critical role in mediating the effects of climate and urbanization on body size. Larger mammals and species that utilize thermal buffering are more sensitive to warmer temperatures, while flexibility in activity time appears to be advantageous in urbanized areas. This work highlights the value of using digitized, natural history data to track how human disturbance drives morphological variation. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Here, we describe the morphological characteristics of D. suzukii hemocytes and evaluate early innate immune responses, including extracellular traps released against the entomopathogen Pseudomonas entomophila and lipopolysaccharides.

	abstract = {The selection of pigs for improved production traits has been, for a long time, the major driver of pig breeding. More recently, because of the increasing concern with the environment, new selection criteria have been explored, such as nitrogen (N) excretion. However, many studies indicate that life cycle assessment (LCA) provides much better indicators of environmental impacts than excretion. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate, using a modeling approach, the relationships between production traits and LCA impacts of individual growing pigs calculated at the farm gate for 1 kg of body weight gain. Performances of pigs were simulated for 2-phase (2P) and precision feeding (PR), using the InraPorc population model (on 1,000 pigs). Nitrogen excretion was positively correlated with feed conversion ratio (FCR; r = +0.96), climate change (CC; r = +0.96), acidification potential (AC; r = +0.97), eutrophication potential (EU; r = +0.97), and land occupation (LO; r = +0.96), whatever the feeding program. However, FCR appeared to be a better indicator of LCA impacts, with very high and positive correlations (r > +0.99) with CC, AC, EU, and LO for both feeding programs. The CC, AC, and EU impacts of pig production for PR feeding were 1.3, 10, and 7.5% lower than for 2P, respectively, but the correlations within each outcome were very similar among feeding programs. It was concluded that the use of FCR as a selection criterion in pig breeding seems to be a promising approach to associate improved performance and low environmental impact of pig fattening. © Copyright © 2021 Monteiro, Brossard, Gilbert and Dourmad.},

Thus, the need for the selection of dairy herds using genetic markers associated with qualitative traits of milk productivity is becoming urgent. This study aimed to determine the preferred and undesirable genotypes of the AluI polymorphism of the growth hormone gene and SnaBI polymorphism of the insulin-like growth factor-1 gene associated with milk productivity and quality indicators of the black-and-white breed. The genotypes of animals were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Materials and Methods: Samples of the black-and-white breed from Kazakhstan served as the research subjects. The polymorphism of the growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 genes was determined by PCR-RFLP. The relationship of bGH-AluI and bIGF-1-SnaBI polymorphisms with productivity was assessed (fat, protein, and milk yield for 305 days of lactation, live weight, somatic cells, and milk production coefficient) by analysis of variance using Statistica 6.0 software. Results: The black-and-white cows with the bGH-AluILV genotype had significantly higher milk yield in 305 days (3174.5±157.2 kg) than those with the bGH-AluILL (2940.0±152.6 kg) and bGH-AluIVV genotypes (2964.0±36.0; p<0.05). The milk fat content of cows with genotypes bGH-AluILV and bGH-AluILL (121.8±6.5 and 120.6±10.2, respectively) was significantly higher than those with bGH-AluIVV genotype (109.8±10.8; p<0.05). The black-and-white cows with the bGHAluILV genotype (96.7±5.3) had significantly more milk protein than those with the bGH-AluILL (90.3±5.6) and bGH-AluIVV (86.9±4.6) genotypes (p<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in the indicators of milk productivity of cows with different genotypes of bIGF-1-SnaBI polymorphism. Conclusion: The results showed that the bGH-AluILV genotype was preferred for the black-and-white breed. The study demonstrated that genotype determined the relevant qualities, while the conditions of feeding, maintenance, and industrial technology provided the manifestation of this genotype. Thus, cows of the same (Wis Burke Ideal) line, having common ancestors in close (IV–V) ranks but living in different farming conditions, had large differences in milk productivity level. The variation was 2046 kg or 67.6% of milk per lactation. © 2021 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.},

However, conventional invasive imaging procedures all require long intraprocedural times and high costs. The rapid development of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) and related image processing technology has facilitated the formulation of noninvasive approaches to perform comprehensive evaluations. Evidence has shown that CCTA has outstanding performance in identifying the degree of stenosis, plaque features, and functional reserve.

The intensification of selection in recent decades has met the expectations of the market chains, at the expenses of functional traits in animals. The issues that the animal breeding industry has to deal with are (i) the preservation of domestic biodiversity; (ii) the breeding goals, in relation to the environmental context and the kinds of livestock farming systems to be promoted, and the limits to be put on the modification of living organisms; (iii) the tools and methods to be used; (iv) the respective role of the different operators.

	abstract = {Irreversible climate change alters the decomposition and sequestration of soil carbon (C). However, the stability of C components in soils with different initial organic matter contents and its relationship with the response of major decomposers to climate warming are still unclear. In this study, we translocated Mollisols with a gradient of organic matter (OM) contents (2%–9%) from in situ cold region to five warmer climatic regions to simulate climate change. Soil C in C-rich soils (OM >5%) was more vulnerable to translocation warming than that in C-poor soils (OM ≤ 5%), with a major loss of functional groups like O-alkyl, O-aryl C and carboxyl C. Variations of microbial β diversity with latitude, temperature and precipitation indicated that C-rich soils contained more resistant bacterial communities and more sensitive fungal communities than C-poor soils, which led to strong C metabolism and high utilization ability of the community in C-rich soils in response to translocation warming. Our results suggest that the higher sensitivity of soils with high organic matter content to climate change is related to the stability and metabolic capacity of major bacterial decomposers, which is important for predicting soil-climate feedback. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The present study aims to address this gap by examining the association between the Dark Triad personality traits, empathy and risk-taking intentions in the five domains – ethical, financial, health/safety, social, and recreational. Method: A sample of 160 young adults residing in Malaysia (Male=69, Female=99, Mage=22.01, SD=2.03) completed the Short Dark Triad Questionnaire, Empathy Scale, and Domain-Specific Risk-Taking Scale through an online survey. Results: Machiavellianism and Psychopathy were positively associated with the five domains of risk-taking, including social, ethical, financial, recreational and health/safety domains, and negatively associated with empathy. Narcissism, on the contrary, was positively correlated to all risk-taking domains except for recreational risk-taking, and showed no significant relationship to empathy. Empathy was a significant predictor in social risk-taking whereas Machiavellianism and Psychopathy were significant predictors in ethical risk-taking intentions. Conclusion: This study expanded existing knowledge on the Dark Triad personalities by demonstrating a link between each Dart Triad trait, potential risk-taking behaviours and empathy. © 2021, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.

	abstract = {The techniques for the production of the environment have received attention because of the increasing air pollution, which results in a negative impact on the living environment of mankind. Over the decades, burgeoning interest in polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) based photocatalysts for heterogeneous catalysis of air pollutants has been witnessed, which is improved by harvesting visible light, layered/defective structures, functional groups, suitable/adjustable band positions, and existing Lewis basic sites. PCN-based photocatalytic air purification can reduce the negative impacts of the emission of air pollutants and convert the undesirable and harmful materials into value-added or nontoxic, or low-toxic chemicals. However, based on previous reports, the systematic summary and analysis of PCN-based photocatalysts in the catalytic elimination of air pollutants have not been reported. The research progress of functional PCN-based composite materials as photocatalysts for the removal of air pollutants is reviewed here. The working mechanisms of each enhancement modification are elucidated and discussed on structures (nanostructure, molecular structue, and composite) regarding their effects on light-absorption/utilization, reactant adsorption, intermediate/product desorption, charge kinetics, and reactive oxygen species production. Perspectives related to further challenges and directions as well as design strategies of PCN-based photocatalysts in the heterogeneous catalysis of air pollutants are also provided. © 2021 The Authors.

Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) was used to identify the SNP (410 bp and 475 bp) in PCR amplified product of intron 4 and exon 10 in WDR41 gene. Both of them were polymorphic with Guanine to Adenine transition, and three genotypes namely AA, AG and GG were observed. In ANKRD31 gene, RFLP was used to identify the SNP in 513 bp PCR amplified product of intron 24 and two SNPs were found. We report for the first time that intron 4 and exon 10 of WDR41 gene is significantly associated with udder depth (UD), udder balance (UB), central ligament (CL), teat circumference (TC), SFF and tear diameter (TD), rear udder width (RUW), and mastitis. SNP rs110012582 in intron 24 of ANKRD31 gene is associated significantly with UD, distance between left and right teat (DLR), SFF, and SNP rs473512406 with udder length (UL), udder width (UW), udder circumference (UC), fore teat length (FTL), rear teat length (RTL), distance between fore and rear teat (DFR), DLR and mastitis. This information can augment future studies to determine the role of WDR41 and ANKRD31 genes as a candidate gene marker with desired udder and teat conformation and mastitis. Thus, it is essential to work for better udder health and prevent the incidence of mastitis in the herd. © 2022 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.},

Each cow was genotyped for 179 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 43 genes in the prolactin and GH-IGF1 pathways. An association mixed-effects model identified three SNPs within the genes AVPR1A, PRLR and SSTR2 associated with DO (P < 0.05), and five SNPs within the genes IGFBP2, IGFBP5, PRLR, PIAS1 and SSTR2 associated with PR (P < 0.05). The SNP effects were estimated and used to calculate the individual molecular breeding values (MBV) for DO and PR. Average MBV were 20.91 ± 0.21 d and 0.29 ± 0.003% for DO and PR, respectively. The correlation between the MBV and DO was 0.0008 (P = 0.968), whereas correlation between MBV and the estimated breeding value (EBV) for DO was −0.16 (P < 0.001) with an adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) of 2.5%. For PR, its correlation with the MBV was 0.15 (P < 0.001) with a R2 of 2.2%, whereas the correlation between MBV and the EBV for PR was 0.31 (P < 0.001) with a R2 of 9.6%. Heritability estimates were 0.06 ± 0.11 and 0.04 ± 0.06 for DO and PR, respectively. In conclusion, candidate gene SNPs from the prolactin and GH-IGF1 pathways were effectively used to construct an MBV for fertility traits in heat-stressed Holstein cattle. These SNPs explained only a small amount of variation for PR, but not for DO; therefore, additional research using denser SNP panels and a larger population is suggested to improve the power of the MBV as genetic predictor for fertility traits in lactating dairy cows managed under warm environmental conditions. © 2021},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated the 1q22 gastric cancer risk locus in disease, but little is known about its underlying oncogenic functions. This study represents a systematic investigation of the biological significance and potential mechanism associated with the gastric cancer risk of SNP rs2075570(C>T) in 1q22. We identified two functional germline variations (rs2049805-C and rs2974931-G) in an active enhancer in a 64.8 kb high-linkage disequilibrium block of rs2075570. The enhancer upregulated ubiquitin associated protein 2 like (UBAP2L) gene expression over a 960 kb distance by chromatin looping. Gastric cancer tissues expressed significantly higher levels of UBAP2L than was observed in the matched noncancerous tissues, and the UBAP2L expression was negatively correlated with patient survival. Downregulation of UBAP2L inhibited the proliferation and invasion of human gastric cancer cells in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. Notably, the two mutant variations significantly enforced the enhancer activity and UBAP2L expression. In conclusion, this study revealed two causal variations in the 1q22 region using tag-SNP rs2075570 as a genetic marker. These variations may affect the occurrence and progression of gastric cancer by reinforcing the expression of the 1q22-Enh enhancer-regulated UBAP2L target gene. © 2021 American Association for Cancer Research},

	abstract = {Characters in invasive populations often differ from those in the native range, and the ability to express different characters may enhance invasive potential. Ants are among the most pervasive and damaging invasive species, by virtue of their transportability and broad-ranging ecological interactions. Their success is often attributed to the ability to exhibit different characteristics in invasive populations, including the formation of large, unicolonial associations (‘supercolonies’). It remains unclear, however, if such characteristics are a product or cause of the ecological dominance of invasive ants, and the advancement of our understanding has likely been restrained by the fact that studies to date have focused on a few globally important species with well-established invasions. In this study, we take advantage of an ongoing invasion of the tramp ant Technomyrmex brunneus in Japan to assess trait plasticity in the invasive range of this species. We find evidence for plasticity in social structure among island populations, with a supercolony evident on one of the three islands studied. Interestingly, we found no evidence of lower genetic diversity in this population, though natural isotope data indicate it was operating at a lower trophic level than other populations. These findings add weight to arguments that invasive species may benefit from the capacity to adaptively mould themselves to new ecological contexts. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Increases in cereals grain yield in the last decades have increased the accumulation of straw on the soil after harvest. Farmers typically open burn the straw to prepare the soil for the next crop, resulting in pollution, emission of greenhouse gases, erosion, loss of soil organic matter, and wildfires. An alternative is feeding straw to ruminants, but straw nutritive value is limited by its high content of lignocellulose and low content of protein. Cereal breeding programs have focused on improving grain yield and quality and agronomic traits, but little attention has been paid to straw nutritive value. We screened straw from 49 genotypes of oats and 24 genotypes of wheat from three cereal breeding trials conducted in Chile for in vitro gas production kinetics. We found moderate effects of the genotype on gas production at 8, 24, and 40 h of incubation, and on the maximum extent and rate of gas production. Gas production was negatively associated with lignin and cellulose contents and not negatively associated with grain yield and resistance to diseases and lodging. Effects observed in vitro need to be confirmed in animal experiments before gas production kinetics can be adopted to identify cereal genotypes with more digestible straw. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Purpose: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is categorized among ten common aggressive malignancies, with a higher incidence and mortality rates in the developing than in developed countries. The inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (INPP5A), as an intracellular-calcium mobilizer and modifier enzyme, facilitates cell responses to various stimuli. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a transformation procedure, has a vital role in cancer progression and metastasis when epithelial cells lose their traits in favor of obtaining mesenchymal features. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between the expression of INPP5A and the involved genes in EMT pathway through the progression and development of the ESCCs. Materials and methods: The gene expression analyses of INPP5A, TWIST1, MMP-2, and EGFR were performed using relative comparative real-time PCR in 58 ESCCs patients compared to corresponding margin-normal esophageal tissues. Results: A significant inverse correlation between INPP5A and EGFR/MMP-2 mRNA expression was observed in tumor samples. Underexpression of INPP5A was significantly correlated with overexpression of TWIST1, MMP-2, and EGFR in different invasiveness and aggressiveness pathological features of the ESCCs (P ​< ​0.05). Conclusions: The results propose a tumor suppressor role for INPP5A and oncogenic function for concomitant expression of the other genes in ESCC invasion and metastasis. The current study is the first report elucidating the correlation between the downregulation of INPP5A and upregulation of TWIST1, MMP-2, and EGFR in ESCC and introduces this panel of the genes as a marker for poor prognosis of the disease. © 2021 Medical University of Bialystok},

Shortly thereafter, further invasion of this tick species into other West African countries was identified. In this paper, we describe the first detection of R. microplus in Guinea and list the vector-borne haemoparasites that were detected in the invading and indigenous Boophilus species. In 2018, we conducted a small-scale survey of ticks infesting cattle in three administrative regions of Guinea: N`Zerekore, Faranah, and Kankan. The tick species were identified by examining their morphological characteristics and by sequencing their COI gene and ITS-2 gene fragments. R. microplus was found in each studied region. In the ticks, we found the DNA of Babesia bigemina, Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma platys, and Ehrlichia sp. The results of this study indicate that R. microplus was introduced into Guinea in association with cows from Mali and/or the Ivory Coast. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

We evaluated two cohorts (cohort: 1 = 31, 2 = 26) of Rarámuri Criollo (JRC), Mexican Criollo (MC) and Criollo × beef-breed crossbred (XC) steers to investigate effects of biotype on growth, carcass traits, and landscape utilization. Steers were weighed approximately once every 2-mo and average daily gains (ADG) calculated. Nine JRC and XC steers per cohort were monitored at 5-min intervals via global positioning systems (GPS) for 1-mo during winter (2015–16) and late-summer (2016–17). Weight and carcass data were analyzed using mixed measures procedures to identify differences between biotype through time. Discriminant analyses were conducted to determine whether grazing behaviors could be discriminated among: 1) JRC and XC steers and JRC cows; 2) steers by season (winter vs. summer); and 3) steers of cohort 1 and 2. Final live and carcass weights of XC were greater than JRC and MC, but all were market ready at 30-mo following a grass-finishing protocol. Carcass quality and ADG were not different among biotypes. Steers were discriminated into different season or cohort groups based on grazing behavior differences but JRC and XC steers exhibited grazing patterns that were similar to those previously observed in JRC cows. Our results suggest that JRC, MC, and XC steers can be developed to slaughter weights in 30-mo using a rangeland-based grass-fed protocol, and that JRC and XC steers exhibit desirable grazing behaviors previously observed in JRC cows. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Membrane protrusion and adhesion to the extracellular matrix, which involves the extension of actin filaments and formation of adhesion complexes, are the fundamental processes for cell migration, tumor invasion, and metastasis. How cancer cells efficiently coordinate these processes remains unclear. Here, we showed that membrane-targeted chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) spatiotemporally regulates the formation of cell-matrix adhesions and membrane protrusions through the recruitment of PIP5Ks to the plasma membrane. Comparative proteomics identified CLIC1 upregulated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and associated with tumor invasiveness, metastasis, and poor prognosis. In response to migration-related stimuli, CLIC1 recruited PIP5K1A and PIP5K1C from the cytoplasm to the leading edge of the plasma membrane, where PIP5Ks generate a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-rich (PIP2-rich) microdomain to induce the formation of integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesions and the signaling for cytoskeleon extension. CLIC1 silencing inhibited the attachment of tumor cells to culture plates and the adherence and extravasation in the lung alveoli, resulting in suppressed lung metastasis in mice. This study reveals what we believe is an unrecognized mechanism that spatiotemporally coordinates the formation of both lamellipodium/invadopodia and nascent cell-matrix adhesions for directional migration and tumor invasion/metastasis. The unique traits of upregulation and membrane targeting of CLIC1 in cancer cells make it an excellent therapeutic target for tumor metastasis.  © 2021, American Society for Clinical Investigation.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen fertilization, besides increasing productivity, can favor the production of well-formed, large, and heavy grains, which are traits valued by the oat processing industry. However, high nitrogen (N) doses may lead to plant lodging, which could be solved by using growth retardant. This study aimed to evaluate the industrial quality of white oat grains cultivated under different nitrogen doses and associated with the growth retardant trinexapac-ethyl in two growing environments. Experiments were conducted in Londrina and Mauá da Serra, PR, Brazil, using the cultivar IPR Afrodite in a randomized block design in a 4 × 2 factorial scheme and four replications. Treatments consisted of four topdressing N doses (0, 30, 60, and 90 kg ha-1) and the application or not of growth retardant. Thousand-grain weight, hectoliter weight, grain index greater than two millimeters, peeling index, and industrial grain yield were evaluated. The effect of N fertilization and growth retardant on the industrial quality of white oat grains depends on the characteristics of the growing environment. The trinexapac-ethyl application reduces grain quality in Londrina and Mauá da Serra. However, the industrial quality of grains is high in both growing environments when the growth retardant is associated with nitrogen doses. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Decabrominated diphenyl ether (BDE‐209) is widely used as a flame retardant and is detected at high levels in the environment. Its toxicities have been reported and have attracted atten-tion. In the present study, broilers were used to determine the response in growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, blood profiles and antioxidant system to BDE‐209 exposure at doses of 0, 0.02, 0.4 and 4 mg/kg. The results showed that BDE‐209 exposure at levels of 0.02 or 0.4 mg/kg increased feed intake and decreased feed efficiency. BDE‐209 altered the blood profiles, such as reducing the numbers of white blood cells, lymphocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes. As com-pared with the control, BDE‐209 exposure significantly increased abdominal fat percentages of broilers at 64.9–159.5% and adversely affected the selected biochemical indicators, including alka-line phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), crea-tine (CRE), which indicated its toxicity to liver and kidney functions. Moreover, BDE‐209 exposure significantly increased plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and decreased the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐px) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), which implied aggravating oxidant stress and decline of antioxidant capacity in broilers. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that the environmental pollutant BDE‐209 adversely influenced growth performance, increased the deposition of abdominal fat, impaired antioxidant capacity and the immune system and had potential toxicity to the liver and kidney of broilers. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The global climate change has a negative influence on the quality of crop production and has been considered a threat in recent years. Henceforth, there is a need for advancement in technology to overcome the issue and improve both the quality and quantity of the crop plants by exploiting their genome. The various single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers have been extensively used in crop breedings as molecular markers with advances in NGS (Nextgeneration sequencing) technology. These SNP markers are cost-effective for variety identification. SNPs have a deterministic role in protein expression. Thereby sequencing and genotyping have enabled crop improvement based on genomics with significant advances in NGS technologies which have also assisted in overcoming the drawbacks in detecting new functional SNPs associated with diverse traits. While SNP markers are found to be highly abundant and prevalent across the genome, functional SNPs are known to have a crucial impact on the phenotypes of plants. Besides, it was also known that SNP markers can be widely used and implemented in genotyping for the identification of structural variants due to their codominance, low cost, flexibility, speed, and ease of automation than other markers. Even in the genome-wide association study (GWAS), SNP markers were considered a significant tool in developing genome-wide haplotypes. Identified SNP patterns from GWAS are useful for understanding plant evolution. Genetic variations derived from the SNP patterns may execute desired phenotypes in the plant that benefits plant breeding and crop improvements. Even though SNPs widely use, technical advancements are needed to overcome the challenges in plant SNPs identification, to understand speciation and evolution through genomic divergence of plants, and to identify associate genomic variations of phenotypic traits. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Estrogen-dependent cancers (e.g., breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers) are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. Recently, exosomes released by tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells have been under the spotlight in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Our study aims at elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the crosstalk between estrogen signaling and CD8+ T cells, and possible intervention values in uterine corpus endometrial cancer (UCEC). Methods: Micro RNA-seq was conducted to screen differentially expressed micro RNA in UCEC. Bioinformatic analysis was processed to predict the target of miR-765. RNA silencing or overexpressing and pharmacologic inhibitors were used to assess the functions of ERβ/miR-765/PLP2/Notch axis in UCEC cell proliferation and invasion in vivo and in vitro. In vivo imaging was performed to evaluate the metastasis of tumor in mice. Combined fluorescent in situ hybridization for miR-765 and immunofluorescent labeling for CD8 was carried out to prove the co-localization between miR-765 and CD8+ T cells. Exosomes derived from CD45RO-CD8+ T cells were isolated to detect the regulatory effects on UCEC. Results: miR-765 is characterized as the most downregulated miRNA in UCEC, and there is a negative correlation between miR-765 and Proteolipid protein 2 (PLP2) in UCEC lesion. Estrogen significantly down-regulates miR-765 level, and facilitates the development of UCEC by estrogen receptor (ER) β. Mechanistically, this process is mediated through the miRNAs (e.g., miR-3584-5p, miR-7-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-124-3p) cluster-controlled regulation of the PLP2, which further regulates Ki-67 and multiple epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecules (e.g, E-cadherin and Vimentin) in a Notch signaling pathway-dependent manner. Interestingly, the selective ER degrader Fulvestrant alleviates estrogen-mediated miR-765/PLP2 expression regulation and UCEC development in ERβ-dependent and -independent manners. Additionally, CD45RO-CD8+ T cell-derived exosomes release more miR-765 than that from CD45RO+CD8+ T cells. In therapeutic studies, these exosomes limit estrogen-driven disease development via regulation of the miR-765/PLP2 axis. Conclusions: This observation reveals novel molecular mechanisms underlying estrogen signaling and CD8+ T cell-released exosomes in UCEC development, and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for UCEC patients with aberrant ERβ/miR-765/PLP2/Notch signaling axis. © The author(s).},

	abstract = {There are numerous cases when conventional spermiogram parameters are all within an acceptable range but boar subfertility persists. The total sperm nuclear DNA fragmentation index (tDFI) is a trait related to fertility and prolificacy problems that is not routinely evaluated in commercial AI boars. The aim of this research was to study the effect of the photoperiod, season and reproductive age of the boar on tDFI (measured by SCSA) of 1279 ejaculates from 372 different boars belonging to 6 different breeds located in 6 AI studs in Spain. tDFI data ranged from 0.018% to 20.1%. Although there was a significant single boar effect in the tDFI occurrence, a negative correlation between the tDFI and the age of the boar was found (p < 0.001). tDFI would decrease due to aging of the boar 0.66% each year old within the observed age range. After including age as a covariate in the ANCOVA, no differences were found in tDFI between photoperiods when the sperm collection date was evaluated. However, when the date of the production of semen in the testis was evaluated, the total percentage of spermatozoa with fragmented nuclear DNA was 1.46% higher in the increasing photoperiod in comparison to the decreasing photoperiod (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, for both dates, the lowest tDFI values corresponded to minimum day length for decreasing photoperiod phase (autumn), while the highest tDFI values were found in summer (maximum day length for decreasing photoperiod phase). © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) dry-cured hams production is greatly dependent on raw meat quality. This study was performed to identify genetic markers associated with the quality of dry-cured ham. Carcass traits of 229 heavy pigs belonging to three commercial genetic lines were registered (weight, EUROP classification). Phenotypic traits (Semimembranosus muscle ultimate pH, ham weight and lean meat content, adsorbed salt) of the corresponding thighs, undergone PDO ham process in three different plants, were measured, using a fast and non-invasive technology. Green ham weight and lean meat percentage influenced the estimated salt content and the weight loss during salting, even if the processing plant greatly affected the variability of the measured ham traits. The genomic data were obtained with the GeneSeek Genomic Profiler (GGP) 70k HD Porcine Array, using the slaughter day and the sex of the animals in the statistical analyses. The phenotypic traits were associated with the genotypes through GenAbel software. The results showed that 18 SNPs located on nine porcine chromosomes were found to be associated with nine phenotypic traits, mainly related to ham weight loss during salting. New associations were found between markers in the genes Neural Precursor Cell Expressed Developmentally Down-Regulated 9 (NEDD9, SSC7), T-Cell Lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis 2 (TIAM2, SSC1), and the ham quality traits. After validation, these SNPs may be useful to improve the quality of thighs for the production of PDO dry-cured hams. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, animal welfare is driving consumers’ purchase choice, hence the challenge to recover rabbit sector from many years of downturn is to find a valuable compromise between animal welfare, farmers’ needs, and meat quality. Among the efforts to improve rabbit welfare, mirrors have been proposed as cages or pens enrichment; however, it is unclear if they affect rabbit meat quality. Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the use of mirrors into free-range areas on color, weight loss, pH, water holding capacity (WHC), fatty acid profile (FA), conjugated dienes (CD) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) of both fresh and stored rabbit meatballs. Specifically, rabbits were divided in three farming groups: in the open group (OG) the rabbits of three replicates could see and smell each other; in the closed group (CG), plastic sheets isolated each replicate; the replicates of the mirror group (MG) were confined as the CG but animals could mirror themselves thanks to two mirrors (120 × 40 cm each) placed inside the area. After 49 days, nine rabbits from each group were slaughtered, their carcass meat was minced to form 40 meatballs for each group destined to be analyzed (n=10) immediately (T0), and after 20 (T20), 40 (T40), and 80 (T80) days of frozen storage (-10°C). The meatballs physical traits were similar among the farming groups, while the pH value was lower in MG (6.02) than OG (6.07), and CG (6.07) meat (P < 0.05). The farming slightly affected the FA content, being the PUFAn-3 amount between 60 and 121 mg/100 g (P > 0.05). Concerning the oxidative status, both CG and MG groups had higher (P < 0.01) TBARS than the OG, while the CDs were unaffected. The duration of storage modified all the physical traits, for instance the weight loss increased (P < 0.001) and the WHC diminished (-5.86%) during the early 20 days. Only the OG group showed a specific ability to maintain its redness value till the T40. Even though the overall PUFAn-3 fraction did not vary, both C20:5n-3 and C22:5n-3 were halved (P < 0.01) and CD (P < 0.001) doubled during the early 20 days. In conclusion, the OG farming was the best method for improving meat quality; however, mirrors can minimize the negative effects of a confined housing on the quality items, hence representing a valuable environmental enrichment. © 2020},

	abstract = {This paper aims to develop standards for a welfare assessment protocol by validating potential categorisation thresholds for assessing beef farms in various beef cow-calf production systems in Namibia. Forty measures, combined from a New Zealand-based protocol plus Namibia-specific measures, are applied to 55 beef farms (17 commercial farms, 20 semi-commercial and 18 communal village farms) during pregnancy testing, and a questionnaire guided interview. The cat-egorised measures on a 3-point welfare score (0: good, 1: marginal, and 2: poor/unacceptable wel-fare) are subsequently compared with the derivation of thresholds based upon the poorest 15% and best 50% of herds for each measure. The overall combined thresholds of continuous measures across the three farm types show 10/22 measures that posed welfare compromise across Namibia, whereas commercial farms have 4/22 measures, and semi-commercial and communal village farms have 12/22 and 11/22, respectively, with high thresholds. Most measures-imposed thresholds are retained because of significant importance to the welfare of animals and preventiveness of the traits, while leniency was given to adjust good feeding and mortality measures to signify periods of drought. Handling measures (fearful, falling/lying) and abrasions thresholds are adjusted to reflect the tem-porary stress caused by infrequent cattle handling, and faulty yard designs/design and possible cattle breed influence on handling. Hence, Namibia needs prioritised investigation of underlying contributing factors and remediation to reduce the high thresholds. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In order to base welfare assessment of dairy cattle on real-time measurement, integration of valid and reliable precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies is needed. The aim of this study was to provide a systematic overview of externally validated and commercially available PLF technologies, which could be used for sensor-based welfare assessment in dairy cattle. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify externally validated sensor technologies. Out of 1,111 publications initially extracted from databases, only 42 studies describing 30 tools (including prototypes) met requirements for external validation. Moreover, through market search, 129 different retailed technologies with application for animal-based welfare assessment were identified. In total, only 18 currently retailed sensors have been externally validated (14%). The highest validation rate was found for systems based on accelerometers (30% of tools available on the market have validation records), while the lower rates were obtained for cameras (10%), load cells (8%), miscellaneous milk sensors (8%), and boluses (7%). Validated traits concerned animal activity, feeding and drinking behavior, physical condition, and health of animals. The majority of tools were validated on adult cows. Non-active behavior (lying and standing) and rumination were the most often validated for the high performance. Regarding active behavior (e.g., walking), lower performance of tools was reported. Also, tools used for physical condition (e.g., body condition scoring) and health evaluation (e.g., mastitis detection) were classified in lower performance group. The precision and accuracy of feeding and drinking assessment varied depending on measured trait and used sensor. Regarding relevance for animal-based welfare assessment, several validated technologies had application for good health (e.g., milk quality sensors) and good feeding (e.g., load cells, accelerometers). Accelerometers-based systems have also practical relevance to assess good housing. However, currently available PLF technologies have low potential to assess appropriate behavior of dairy cows. To increase actors' trust toward the PLF technology and prompt sensor-based welfare assessment, validation studies, especially in commercial herds, are needed. Future research should concentrate on developing and validating PLF technologies dedicated to the assessment of appropriate behavior and tools dedicated to monitoring the health and welfare in calves and heifers. © Copyright © 2021 Stygar, Gómez, Berteselli, Dalla Costa, Canali, Niemi, Llonch and Pastell.},

Trial was conducted on 40 buffaloes of nearly at the same lactation stage, milk yield and parity selected from village- Bhakhrana, Block- Kotputli, District- Jaipur, Rajasthan. Buffaloes were divided in two groups; 20 buffaloes were kept in each group, viz. control and treatment group. Two buffaloes of each farmer were selected to maintain similarity in feeding and management practice. Treatment group was fed with chelated mineral mixture @ 40 g/buffalo/day till 90 days of early lactation period, whereas the control group was not supplemented. The data were recorded by the farmers daily in the morning and evening and by the researcher at fortnightly interval. Analysis of data revealed that supplementation of chelated mineral mixture increased the milk yield by 1.55 lit/day (15.82%) in treated group. Similarly, reproductive performance traits such as onset of first estrum after calving, no. of AI required for conception and service period were also recorded at the same interval between these groups. The B:C ratio of chelated mineral mixture supplementation was observed 1:7.75 under farmer management practices. These findings may suggest that supplementation of chelated mineral mixture enhanced the productive and reproductive performance for getting higher return and sustainable profit from buffalo farming. © 2021 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

The aim of the current study was to investigate some of biomedical applications of silver NP synthesis using extracts from leaves of Eriobotrya japonica. Colour changes, UV–visible spectroscopy, SEM, zeta potential, dynamic light scattering, FTIR and XRD were used to confirm AgNPs formation. The UV–vis spectrum absorption band was observed at almost 430 nm. The SEM image shows quasi-spherical shape of AgNPs. The zeta potential demonstrated the negative surface charge of NPs. FTIR results showed the functional groups of AgNPs. Crystalline nature of AgNPs was confirmed by XRD pattern. MTT assay was used to study the anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 and HeLa cells. Apoptosis was tested using a DNA-fragmentation test, and expression of P53. AgNPs inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 and HeLa cells, and reduced inflammation. Treatment with AgNPs significantly decreased allergic disorder. AgNPs stimulated the phagocytosis process in BMDMs. The results suggested that AgNPs could be a promising therapy for future and preventing inflammation, reduce allergic disorders and prevent bacterial infection through the up-regulation of phagocytosis. Hence, future work such as developed and improved NPs as adjuvants, immune-modulating substances and nano-drug delivery system is needed. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The present study evaluated the physicochemical and sensory traits of marketed table eggs, deriving from different farming methods (cage, barn, and organic) and sampled in different marketing periods (June, July, September, October). A total of n=540 eggs (n=45 eggs/farming method/sampling period) of “medium” weight-grading were purchased and subjected to physical measurements (shell, yolk, and albumen physical traits), chemical evaluations (proximate composition, cholesterol content and fatty acid profile of the edible portion) and to a descriptive sensory analysis. Results highlighted that eggs physical traits often differed among the considered farming methods: organic eggs had the lowest albumen pH (P < 0.001) and the highest albumen proportion (P = 0.004), whereas barn and cage eggs had the highest yolk proportion (P = 0.026). Barn eggs had the heaviest shell proportion (P = 0.011), which did not however imply a higher resistance to penetration and compression tests. As expected, egg colour differed according to the farming method with cage eggs displaying the highest overall yolk colour intensity (a*, b* and yolk colour FAN; P < 0.001), followed by barn and organic eggs. The egg marketing period demonstrated to be a relevant factor in determining egg physical attributes too. Surprisingly, organic eggs showed constant albumen, yolk and shell physical characteristics, and yolk colour traits, whereas barn and cage eggs displayed a certain variability in these terms. Cage eggs showed the highest protein (P = 0.001) and barn eggs the highest lipid (P = 0.003) contents, whereas cholesterol content was only affected by the marketing period in all three farming methods. Organic eggs were the richest in moisture (P = 0.003), in polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) of both n-6 (P = 0.011) and n-3 series (P < 0.001), whereas cage ones had the highest saturated (P = 0.030) and monounsaturated (P = 0.018) FA. Among the considered sensory traits, farming method only affected the yolk colour intensity, which was the lowest in organic eggs and, for cage and barn eggs, it decreased along the marketing period. Results of the present research indicated that the overall quality of marketed table eggs effectively differs according to the farming method and to the marketing period time which is a relevant information, yet poorly investigated, from the consumer's point of view. Organic eggs were the most distinguishable, especially in terms of yolk colour and nutritional composition. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Identification has always been very vital in forensic casework. Fingerprint patterns are population-specific and individualistic, that makes fingerprinting an important biological trait in human biology and forensics. Fingerprint is an impression of the friction ridges of the finger-ball, where friction ridges are raised portions of the epidermis. Skin on human fingertips contains ridges and valleys which together forms dis-tinctive patterns. These patterns are fully developed in intra-uterine life and remain unaltered until the death of the individual. Injuries such as cuts, burns and bruises can temporarily damage quality of fingerprints but when fully healed, the patterns are restored. The number of ridges present in a unit area on a fingerprint is called the Fingerprint Ridge Density (FPRD). The epidermal ridge density can be determined by examining two parameters-ridge width and distance between the ridges. The thickness of the epidermal ridges varies between individuals and between the sexes. The present review of literature focuses on the sexual dimorphism on the basis of the FPRD and its possible use in forensic examinations. Most of the studies pertaining to the estimation of sex from the FPRD have been conducted in the last two decades when Mark A. Acree in 1999, devised a method of estimation of sex on Caucasian and African-American descent. The present analysis evaluates the studies found in the PubMed database conducted after Acree, 1999. The estimation of sex from the FPRD is based upon the fact that the females have a fine detailing of ridges and consequently more ridges are covered in a unit space in the fingerprints of females as compared to males. The paper also highlights recent advancements and future perspectives in the area of FPRD. (www.actabiomedica.it). © Mattioli 1885.},

	abstract = {This experiment was carried out to evaluate the Lilium leichtlinii var maximowiczii germplasm collected from the different natural habitats from all over Korea. In total 30 accessions were studied for nine traits viz. plant height, leaf length, leaf width, the numbers of flowers, flower diameter, length of outer tepal, width of outer tepal, the number of leaf burn, and days to flowering in randomized block design with three replications. The ANOVA revealed highly significant variability prevailing among the investigated genotypes for almost all studied traits (except leaf width). The higher estimated value of GCV, PCV, heritability (H2), and genetic advance as percent of the mean was obtained for the number of flowers and leaf burn. The moderate to high GCV and PCV coupled with higher heritability estimates (H2) and GAM were found for plant height and flower diameter. Progeny selection would be effective as the prevalence of additive gene effect for these traits. Besides, leaf width, leaf length, length of outer tepal, the width of outer tepal, and days to flowering traits were possessed moderate to low GCV and PCV value coupled with the moderate value of heritability estimate with the low level of GAM proved to be the prevalence of non-additive genetic effect thereby indicating the necessity of alternative breeding approach for these traits improvement and breeding scheme. For the former group of traits breeding hybridization and selection would be an effective method, and primarily mean performance of these traits would be very handy for the decision of selection. © All the articles published by Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License Based on a work at www.jebas.org.},

	abstract = {The number of teats is related to the nursing ability of sows. In the present study, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for traits related to teat number in Duroc pig population. Two mixed models, one for counted and another for binary phenotypic traits, were employed to analyze seven traits: the right (RTN), left (LTN), and total (TTN) teat numbers; maximum teat number on a side (MAX); left minus right side teat number (LR); the absolute value of LR (ALR); and the presence of symmetry between left and right teat numbers (SLR). We identified 11, 1, 4, 13, and 9 significant SNPs associated with traits RTN, LTN, MAX, TTN, and SLR, respectively. One significant SNP (MARC0038565) was found to be simultaneous associated with RTN, LTN, MAX and TTN. Two annotated genes (VRTN and SYNDIG1L) were located in genomic region around this SNP. Three significant SNPs were shown to be associated with TTN, RTN and MAX traits. Seven significant SNPs were simultaneously detected in two traits of TTN and RTN. Other two SNPs were only identified in TTN. These 13 SNPs were clustered in the genomic region between 96.10—98.09 Mb on chromosome 7. Moreover, nine significant SNPs were shown to be significantly associated with SLR. In total, four and 22 SNPs surpassed genome-wide significance and suggestive significance levels, respectively. Among candidate genes annotated, eight genes have documented association with the teat number relevant traits. Out of them, DPF3 genes on Sus scrofa chromosome (SSC) 7 and the NRP1 gene on SSC 10 were new candidate genes identified in this study. Our findings demonstrate the genetic mechanism of teat number relevant traits and provide a reference to further improve reproductive performances in practical pig breeding programs. © 2021 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The boophilid ticks are regarded as highly adaptive tick species in tropical and subtropical regions and considered to be the most economically important ectoparasites to cattle worldwide. To that, a geographical survey to investigate the distribution of boophilid ticks on grazing cattle was conducted seasonally between October 2018 and September 2019 at Elundini, Senqu and Walter Sisulu Local Municipalities in the north-eastern region of the Eastern Cape Province (ECP). Ten cattle were selected randomly during the tick sampling at each locality. Ticks were carefully removed from cattle and placed into sampling tubes containing 70% ethanol. During tick sampling, special attention was paid to the tick predilection sites such as lower perineum, neck, dewlap and ventral body parts which are the preferred sites for blue ticks. Based on the morphological traits, a total of 6176 ticks belonging to two boophilid tick species of Rhipicephalus were identified: Rhipicephalus decoloratus (98.30%) and Rhipicephalus microplus (1.70%). Locality and season significantly influenced boophilid tick distribution (P < 0.05). Rhipicephalus decoloratus had a significantly higher prevalence (P < 0.05) in Elundini during the hot-dry (3.37 ± 0.121) and hot-wet (3.35 ± 0.121) seasons compared to other localities. In Senqu, R. microplus had high counts (P < 0.05) during the post-rainy season (1.06 ± 0027) compared to other localities. Interestingly, the current study recorded Asiatic invasive pantropical blue tick (R. microplus) for the first time in the north-eastern region of the ECP. This tick is of great veterinary economic importance locally and globally, and thus necessitates continuous monitoring and control. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum, a major cultured shellfish species, is threatened by infection with the microparasite Perkinsus olseni, whose prevalence increases with high water temperatures. Under the current trend of climate change, the already severe effects of this parasitic infection might rapidly increase the frequency of mass mortality events. Treating infectious diseases in bivalves is notoriously problematic, therefore selective breeding for resistance represents a key strategy for mitigating the negative impact of pathogens. A crucial step in initiating selective breeding is the estimation of genetic parameters for traits of interest, which relies on the ability to record parentage and accurate phenotypes in a large number of individuals. Here, to estimate the heritability of resistance against P. olseni, a field experiment mirroring conditions in industrial clam production was set up, a genomic tool was developed for parentage assignment, and parasite load was determined through quantitative PCR. A mixed-family cohort of potentially 1,479 clam families was produced in a hatchery by mass spawning of 53 dams and 57 sires. The progenies were seeded in a commercial clam production area in the Venice lagoon, Italy, where high prevalence of P. olseni had previously been reported. Growth and parasite load were monitored every month and, after 1 year, more than 1,000 individuals were collected for DNA samples and phenotype recording. A pooled sequencing approach was carried out using DNA samples from the hatchery broodstock and from a Venice lagoon clam population, providing candidate markers used to develop a 245-SNP panel. Parentage assignment for 246 F1 individuals showed sire and dam representation were high (75 and 85%, respectively), indicating a very limited risk of inbreeding. Moderate heritability (0.23 ± 0.11–0.35 ± 0.13) was estimated for growth traits (shell length, shell weight, total weight), while parasite load showed high heritability, estimated at 0.51 ± 0.20. No significant genetic correlations were found between growth-associated traits and parasite load. Overall, the preliminary results provided by this study show high potential for selecting clams resistant to parasite load. Breeding for resistance may help limit the negative effects of climate change on clam production, as the prevalence of the parasite is predicted to increase under a future scenario of higher temperatures. Finally, the limited genetic correlation between resistance and growth suggests that breeding programs could incorporate dual selection without negative interactions. © Copyright © 2020 Smits, Enez, Ferraresso, Dalla Rovere, Vetois, Auvray, Genestout, Mahla, Arcangeli, Paillard, Haffray and Bargelloni.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years, environmental pollution and heavy metal pollution caused by rapid urbanization and industrialization have become increasingly serious. Among them, mercury (II) ion (Hg2+) is one of the highly toxic heavy metal ions, and its pollution comes from various natural resources and human activities. Therefore, people attach great importance to the development of analytical methods for effective analysis and sensitive detection of Hg2+. Objective: Using grape skin as a green and environment friendly carbon source to synthesize fluorescent carbon dots and to apply them in detecting the concentration of Hg2+ in water. Methods: Using “Hutai No. 8" grape skin as a carbon source, fluorescent carbon dots were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method. The structure and fluorescent properties of the carbon dots were tested using TEM, XPS, XRD, and other characterization instruments, and their utilization on the detection of mercury ions in the actual water samples was explored. Results: The CDs had a particle size of about 4.8 nm and a spherical shape. There were N-H, C-N, C=O, and other functional groups on the surface. It was found that Hg2+ has an obvious fluorescence quenching effect on CDs, and thus CDs fluorescence quenching method to detect the concentration Hg2+ was established, and the detection limit was 3.7 µM, which could be applied to test the concentration of Hg2+ in water samples. Conclusion: Using grape skin as a carbon source, fluorescent carbon dots were successfully synthesized by the hydrothermal method. Carbon dots were used to detect mercury ions in water, and a method for detecting mercury ions in actual water samples was established. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Recently, in many parts of the world, greater importance has been given to lamb meat as well as to the intensive production of lamb and sheep, due to demand for this type of meat at affordable prices. In Serbia, similar to most European countries, the structure of total sheep meat production comprises about 70% lamb meat and 30% sheep meat. This study assessed resource-based measures on 11 dairy sheep farms and investigated, in a total of 30 lambs, the effects of sex, the presence of bruises and pneumonia in carcasses, and carcass and meat quality. Carcass (carcass length, thigh length, croup width, subcutaneous fat thickness, presence of bruises) and meat quality (pH, temperature, drip, thawing and cooking losses, color, and meat quality classes) traits were measured post mortem. The most common deficiencies on farms were high stocking density, poor hygienic conditions, dirty drinkers, and lack of outdoor access. Regarding sex differences, higher prevalences of carcass bruises and severe pneumonia were recorded in male lambs. Meat pH (pH45min), sensory color score, and prevalence of dark, firm and dry (DFD) meat were higher in lambs with carcass bruises. The occurrence of quality defects (DFD meat) was higher in lambs with severe pneumonia. It can be concluded that it is necessary to improve the welfare conditions on the lamb farms and pre-slaughter conditions in order to achieve better lamb meat quality.

	abstract = {Parasites of the genus Haemoproteus are vector-borne avian haemosporidia commonly found in bird species of the world. Haemoproteus infections are typically considered relatively benign in birds. However, some Haemoproteus species cause severe disease and mortality, especially for captive birds removed from their original habitat. In September 2018, a captive 15-year-old snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), kept in a zoological garden of Japan, died subacutely after presenting leg dysfunction. This case showed significantly low PCV and elevated AST, ALT, CK, and LDH values. Many megalomeronts with prominent morphological characteristics of Haemoproteus were observed in the left leg muscles. Those megalomeronts exhibited multilocular structures and were internally filled with merozoites. A new lineage of Haemoproteus was detected by subsequent PCR for the cytochrome b (cytb) gene of avian haemosporidia from DNA extracted from several organ tissues. The detected lineage was classified in the subgenus Parahaemoproteus and was similar to those from the wild birds inhabiting the region including the study area, suggesting that this snowy owl likely acquired its infection from wild birds. This is the first report of a fatal case of a captive bird with a locally transmitted Haemoproteus infection in Japan. We considered the pathogenicity of this infection in conjunction with the clinical course and hematology results. We surmise that snowy owls may be particularly susceptible to infection with Haemoproteus parasites, and warming northern temperatures may exacerbate the overall health of these and other high latitude birds. Further research into the prevalence of Haemoproteus in wild birds near zoological gardens and potential biting midge vectors is necessary for the ex situ conservation of introduced birds. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is a non-domesticated model grass that has been used to assess population level genomic variation. We have previously established a collection of 55 Brachypodium accessions that were sampled to reflect five different climatic regions of Turkey; designated 1a, 1c, 2, 3 and 4. Genomic and methylomic variation differentiated the collection into two subpopulations designated as coastal and central (respectively from regions 1a, 1c and the other from 2, 3 and 4) which were linked to environmental variables such as relative precipitation. Here, we assessed how far genomic variation would be reflected in the metabolomes and if this could be linked to an adaptive trait. Metabolites were extracted from eight-week-old seedlings from each accession and assessed using flow infusion high-resolution mass spectrometry (FIE-HRMS). Princi-pal Component Analysis (PCA) of the derived metabolomes differentiated between samples from coastal and central subpopulations. The major sources of variation between seedling from the coastal and central subpopulations were identified. The central subpopulation was typified by significant increases in alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Coastal subpopulation exhibited elevated levels of the auxin, indolacetic acid and rhamnose. The metabolomes of the seedling were also determined following the imposition of drought stress for seven days. The central subpopulation exhibited a metabolomic shift in response to drought, but no significant changes were seen in the coastal one. The drought responses in the central subpopu-lation were typified by changes in amino acids, increasing the glutamine that could be functioning as a stress signal. There were also changes in sugars that were likely to be an osmotic counter to drought, and changes in bioenergetic metabolism. These data indicate that genomic variation in our Turkish Brachypodium collection is largely reflected as distinctive metabolomes (“metabolotypes”) through which drought tolerance might be mediated. © 2021 by the authors.

Following the first detection in September 2018, we conducted a two-week mosquito monitoring by ovitraps in order to determine if there were established populations of Aedes albopictus in Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia. Ninety-four Ae. albopictus eggs (0 to 18 eggs per ovitrap per week) were collected from 7 (14%) ovitraps in 3 (30%) municipalities. Thirty-eight eggs (40.4%) successfully hatched and the adult mosquitoes were identified by morphology and PCR. No other potentially invasive species were identified during the monitoring period. Ae. albopictus distribution is expanding and poses a risk for an Aedes-borne disease transmission in North Macedonia. The available data highlight the need for a regular monitoring for tiger mosquitoes to plan adequate control measures. Copyright: © 2020 Cvetkovikj A.

	abstract = {The beef aging process is essential for compliance with certain major requisites, such as sensory characteristics for cooking and meat processing. Meat quality analysis of Yunling cattle, a new hybrid beef cattle bred by Chinese researchers, during the aging process, represents a major research gap. To explore Yunling beef initially, indicators associated with meat quality during the aging process of Yunling, Simmental, and Wenshan cattle were measured. In addition, some important economic traits were detected in the three breeds, including growth performance and carcass characteristics. The results showed that the growth performance, carcass traits, pH, and water holding capacity of Yunling and Simmental cattle were basically the same and better, respectively, than those of Wenshan cattle. The proportions of individual fatty acids in Yunling beef were healthier than in the other two breeds. Aging time did not affect the fatty acid profiles of the beef (p > 0.05). The contents of certain fatty acids in the three beef types displayed some differences in terms of days of aging (p < 0.05). The tenderness and meat color were better in the Yunling beef as the aging time increased, indicating that Yunling beef aged for 7 days was more suitable for cooking, exhibiting better sensory characteristics. Thus, a 7-day short-term aging process is very effective in improving the quality of Yunling beef. Our study attempted to fill a gap in the Yunling beef quality analysis during aging, providing further evidence for Yunling beef improvement. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate and describe phenotypic traits for carcass and meat quality in Nellore cattle belonging to the breeding programs. Data from 718 Nellore animals participated in the Delta Gen, CRV Paint and Nelore Qualitas breeding programs were used. Meat quality traits were measured and the data were analyzed. The following means and standard deviations of the meat quality traits were obtained: shear force (SF = 5.7 ± 1.3 kg), myofibril fragmentation index (MFI = 32.0 ± 15.3), cooking loss (CL = 27.7 ± 3.1%), intramuscular lipid content (ILC = 0.9 ± 0.5%), backfat thickness (BFT = 4.2 ± 1.4 mm), marbling score (MS = 2.6 ± 0.36), rib eye area (REA = 72.8 ± 7.35 cm2) and instrumental color (lightness (L* = 27.9 ± 2.7), redness (a* = 12.4 ± 1.86), yellowness (b* = 5.5 ± 1.0)). Significant phenotypic correlations were observed between BFT and MS (0.2314), and between MS and ILC (0.1308). A negative and significant correlation was found between SF and MFI (-0.5525); however, the correlation with MFI was low in animals with SF values ​​higher than 6 kg. In principal component analysis (PCA), the first four eigenvalues of the matrix of direct additive genetic variance explained 61.26% of the total additive genetic variance in the meat quality traits. The most important meat quality traits in PC1 were a*, b* and CL. PC2 was characterized by MFI and color (a* and b*), PC3 by MS, BFT and L* and PC4 by ILC, L* and b*. Furthermore, BFT was positively associated with MS, SF and CL, and SF was negatively associated with MFI. The present study suggests that muscle growth and backfat thickness were satisfactory; however, intramuscular fat deposition and meat tenderness still require more attention from the breeding programs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate demographic traits in four Borgou cattle farming systems previously identified in northern Benin using the 12MO retrospective cross-sectional survey method. The results showed that females were dominant (>65%) in “semi-intensive purebred Borgou cattle farming”(SIntPur),“large transhumant of Zebu and Borgou crossbred cattle farming” (LargeZB) and “small transhumant of Zebu and Borgou crossbred cattle farming” (SmallZB) conversely to “sedentary purebred Borgou cattle farming” (SedPur) with less than 20%. SIntPur and SedPur herds presented the best reproduction parameters: higher prolificacy rates (0.967±0.017 and 0.913±0.060 year-1 respectively) and parturition rates (0.710±0.049 and 0.685±0.062 year-1 respectively). Intake rates were higher in SedPur herds (p<0.05). Offtake rates were higher in LargeZB and SmallZB herds (0.055±0.009 and 0.096±0.028 year-1 respectively). Regarding Global Demographic Indicators, SedPur herds showed higher multiplication rate (1.392 year-1±0.201). Production rates were higher and positive in SedPur (0.444 year-1±0.081) farms followed by SIntPur (0.202 year-1±0.022) farms while lower and negative in LargeZB and SmallZB farms (-0.036 year-1±0.005 and -0.040 year-1±0.002 respectively). Growth rates were higher and positive in SIntPur (0.271 year-1±0.028) farms followed by SedPur (0.022 year-1±0.201) farms while lower and negative in LargeZB and SmallZB farms (-0.064 year-1±0.013 and -0.032 year-1±0.028 respectively).

	abstract = {This study aimed to determine the intensity, seasonality, and distribution by genera of, as well as to identify phenotypic markers of susceptibility to, gastrointestinal parasites among sheep on farms within the Brazilian savanna (cerrado) biome. We evaluated 1271 sheep, on seven farms, during the rainy season (in December 2017 and December 2018) and dry season (in July 2018 and July 2019). Parasitological evaluation was based on culture and EPG. We calculated hematocrit, as well as the body condition score and feces score. Of the sheep evaluated, 34.15% had moderate-to-severe parasitic infection. The factors of herds’ phenotypic characterization about helminth infections were (p ≤ 0.05 for all): Anemia (OR = 5.72); leanness (OR = 1.80); loose stools or diarrhea (OR = 1.54); breed other than Santa Inês (OR = 2.31); “weaned lamb” category (OR = 4.76); “lambing ewe” category (OR = 4.66); and dry season (OR = 2.37). Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Oesophagostomum, and Cooperia accounted for 76.40%, 20.23%, 2.89%, and 0.47%, respectively, of the helminth genera identified, with their proportional distributions being comparable between the rainy and dry seasons. Changes in health management, with regard to helminth infection control, are urgently needed in order to combat the disease more effectively and sustainably. © 2021, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology.

The response rate was 56%, with 57% of respondents being nurses and 63% women. Doctors, less experienced and non-indigenous participants had a significantly higher ATMS (all p ≤ 0.01). The main contributors of the ATMS were the fear of side effects and of addiction. In multivariate analysis, being a doctor, less experience and non-indigenous status were predictive of the ATMS; each point of the SUS increased the ATMS by 0.24 point. The fear of side effects and of addiction were the major contributors of opiophobia among ED healthcare providers; opiophobia was also associated with their personality traits. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of this study was to explore the role of negative coping behaviors, situational factors (emotional responses, stressors, coping strategies), and dispositional factors (trait gratitude and hope) that may contribute to depressive symptoms in the aftermath of Hurricanes Maria and Michael (H-MM). Cross-sectional data were collected through a questionnaire from communities in Florida that were directly impacted by Hurricanes Maria and Michael in 2017 and 2018 (N = 566; Mage = 41.3, 28% minorities). Hierarchical regression procedures were utilized to explore factors predicting depressive symptoms, with blocks of variables added following predetermined steps. Respondents who reported more hurricane-related negative emotions and stressors and who relied more on negative coping behaviors were more likely to report depressive symptoms, but those who reported greater hope and gratitude were less likely to have symptoms. To improve the health and well-being of disaster victims, future research should further examine negative coping and positive affect so as to improve interventions as well as disaster relief efforts in affected communities © 2021.

	abstract = {In spite of the impressive advancements observed on both management and genetic factors, udder health still represents one of most demanding objectives to be attained in the dairy cattle industry. Udder morphology and especially teat condition might represent the first physical barrier to pathogens’ access. The objectives of this study were to investigate the genetic component of teat condition and to elucidate its relationship with both milk yield and somatic cell scores in dairy cattle. Moreover, the effect of selection for both milk yield and somatic cell scores on teat condition was also investigated. A multivariate analysis was conducted on 10,776 teat score records and 30,160 production records from 2469 Italian Holstein cows. Three teat scoring traits were defined and included in the analysis. Heritability estimates for the teat score traits were moderate to low, ranging from 0.084 to 0.238. When teat score was based on a four-classes ordinal scoring, its genetic correlation with milk yields and somatic cell score were 0.862 and 0.439, respectively. The scale used to classify teat-end score has an impact on the magnitude of the estimates. Genetic correlations suggest that selection for milk yield could deteriorate teat health, unless more emphasis is given to somatic cell scores. Considering that both at national and international level, the current selection objectives are giving more emphasis to health traits, a further genetic deterioration in teat condition is not expected. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Low-input (LI) dairy farming, relying heavily on grazing, is increasing in popularity for perceived sustainability, welfare, and milk nutritional quality benefits. However, there is little research into the breed suitability for these systems. The popular Holstein–Friesians are not well-suited to LI production as, to achieve their potential high yields, they require high levels of concentrate intakes and veterinary inputs. Holstein–Friesians were traditionally bred for high milk yields, which often correlate negatively with functional traits, such as fertility and health. This drives the need for alternative breed choices, and UK dairy farmers use several crossbreeding practices. Additionally, classic measures of production efficiency (kilogram feed per liter of milk) are not the sole priority in LI systems, which also aim for improved health, fertility, forage conversion, and milk quality. This study aimed to explore the effect of breeding strategy on LI and organic production in dairy systems, collecting data from 17 farms throughout England and Wales: 7 organic and 10 low-input conventional systems with both purebred and crossbred cows from different breeds. Records from 1,070 cows were collected, including background data, health, fertility, breeding, and parity. Additionally, milk was analyzed on four occasions (autumn 2011 and winter, spring, and summer 2012). Principal components analysis was used to visualize the effect of management, Farm ID, and stage of lactation on LI production. The analysis clustered cows by Farm ID, showing that individual management practice on each farm had the greatest impact on various production traits. Cows were allocated a composite score based on their yield, health records, and milk fatty acid profile, and a linear mixed-effects model indicated (p < 0.01) that crossbred New Zealand Friesian cows scored highest, whereas Dairy Shorthorn cows scored the lowest. This paper highlights weaknesses in current breeding programs for LI and organic farms in the UK, in terms of the alignment of breeds with husbandry practices. Additional research is needed to explore any gene by environment interactions to meet the true potential of individual cows and certain breeds under LI and organic management. © Copyright © 2020 Davis, Stergiadis, Chatzidimitriou, Sanderson, Leifert and Butler.},

	abstract = {Italian heavy pig selection programs are based on production (average daily gain, ADG; feed gain ratio, FGR), carcass (weight of lean cuts, LC; ham weight, HW; backfat thickness, BFT) and meat quality traits of the green hams (ham weight loss at first salting, HWLFS; and visible intermuscular fat, VIF). In this study, we evaluated whether a selective genotyping approach previously designed for BFT could identify markers associated with other traits (ADG, FGR, HW, HWLFS, LC and VIF), most of which correlated with BFT. Italian Large White gilts were chosen according to their extreme estimated breeding values for BFT (275 with the most negative and 278 with the most positive EBVs) within a population of about 12,000 sib-tested pigs. A total of 736 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes for fat deposition and/or related traits were genotyped. After filtering, a total of 279 SNPs in 234 genes remained for association analyses that were carried out using random residuals (RRs) for the six mentioned traits. Four SNPs in three candidate genes were associated with some of the considered traits. A SNP in the exosome component 1 (EXOSC1) gene and a SNP in the glycogen phosphorylase L (PYGL) gene were associated with HWLFS RRs. Two SNPs within the TBC1 (tre-2/USP6, BUB2, cdc16) domain family, member 1 (TBC1D1) gene were associated with LC RRs and suggestively associated with other performance, carcass and meat traits. Association analysis using six TBC1D1 haplotypes, inferred from four genotyped SNPs within this gene, confirmed the results of the single-marker association study. This study contributes to dissect the biological mechanisms underlying the genetic correlations among BFT, HWLFS and LC, which are critical for the sustainable implementation of tailored selection programs in heavy pigs. © 2020},

	abstract = {Long-lived species are particularly interesting for investigation of trade-offs that shape reproductive allocation and the effective contribution to the next generations. Life history theory predicts that these species will buffer environmental stochasticity via changes in the reproductive investment, while maintaining high adult survival rates. The spur-thighed tortoise was selected as a case study in order to investigate the relationship between the linked maternal characteristics (size and age) and related traits in their hatchlings. We tracked naturally emerging hatchlings from young and old females under semi-natural conditions to test variations in hatchling numbers, body mass, size and survival over two years. We used linear mixed-effect models to analyze variations in hatchling body mass and size, and a mark–release–recapture framework to model their survival. Our study illustrates that old females of long-lived species have greater offspring numbers, greater survival and smaller size when compared with those of young females. The interannual variability evidenced the reduced offspring number and survival in the lower autumn rainfall and spring mean temperature year. Our results highlight the role of maternal age and climatic conditions in the population dynamics and the need for long-term studies of reproduction traits for designating adequate conservation strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Leaves in different positions respond differently to dynamic ﬂuctuations in light availability, temperature and to multiple environmental stresses. The current hypothesis states that elevated atmospheric CO2 (e[CO2]) can compensate for the negative effects of water scarcity regarding leaf gas exchanges and coffee bean quality traits over the canopy vertical profile, in interactions with light and temperature microclimate during the two final stages of berry development. Responses of Coffea arabica L. were observed in the 5th year of a free air CO2 enrichment experiment (FACE) under water-limited rainfed conditions. The light dependent leaf photosynthesis curves (A/PAR) were modelled for leaves sampled from vertical profile divided into four 50-cm thick layers. e[CO2] significantly increased gross photosynthesis (AmaxGross), the apparent quantum yield efficiency, light compensation point, light saturation point (LSP) and dark respiration rate (Rd). As a specific stage response, considering berry ripening, all parameters calculated from A/PAR were insensitive to leaf position over the vertical profile. Lack of a progressive increase in AmaxGross and LSP was observed over the whole canopy profile in both stages, especially in the two lowest layers, indicating leaf plasticity to light. Negative correlation of Rd to leaf temperature (TL) was observed under e[CO2] in both stages. Under e[CO2], stomatal conductance was also negatively correlated with TL, reducing leaf transpiration and Rd even with increasing TL. This indicated coffee leaf acclimation to elevated temperatures under e[CO2] and water restriction. The e[CO2] attenuation occurred under water restriction, especially in A and water use efficiency, in both stages, with the exception of the lowest two layers. Under e[CO2], coffee produced berries in moderate- and high light level layers, with homogeneous distribution among them, contrasted to the heterogeneous distribution under actual CO2. e[CO2] led to increased caffeine content in the highest layer, with reduction of chlorogenic acid and lipids under moderate light and to raised levels of sugar in the shaded low layer. The ability of coffee to respond to e[CO2] under limited soil water was expressed through the integrated individual leaf capacities to use the available light and water, resulting in final plant investments in new reproductive structures in moderate and high light level layers.  © 2021 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus (Theobald, 1901) settled in 2013 in the Alsace region, in the northeast of France. In this temperate area, some mosquito species use diapause to survive cold winter temperatures and thereby foster settlement and dispersal. This study reports diapause and its seasonality in a field population of Ae. japonicus in the northeast of France. For two years, eggs were collected from May to the beginning of November. They were most abundant in summer and became sparse in late October. Diapause eggs were determined by the presence of a fully developed embryo in unhatched eggs after repeated immersions. Our study showed effective diapause of Ae. japonicus in this part of France. At the start of the egg-laying period (week 20), we found up to 10% of eggs under diapause, and this rate reached 100% in October. The 50% cut-off of diapause incidence was determined by the end of summer, leading to an average calculated maternal critical photoperiod of 13 h 23 min. Interestingly, diapause was shown to occur in part of the eggs even at the earliest period of the two seasons, i.e. in May of each year.

	abstract = {Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite in the phylum Apicomplexa, is the etiological agent of cryptosporidiosis, an intestinal infection characterized by profuse watery diarrhea. Over 30 species of Cryptosporidium are recognized, some host specific whereas others infect a broader host range. Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum are the species most commonly associated with human infection; C. hominis is largely associated only with human infections, but C. parvum is also associated with infection in animals, especially young ruminants. In some regions, cryptosporidiosis is a serious veterinary problem, particularly for calves, and lambs. Many outbreaks of human cryptosporidiosis have been associated with zoonotic transmission following contact with infected animals. In Africa, where cryptosporidiosis is a major contributor to pediatric morbidity and mortality, evidence suggests transmission is principally anthroponotic. Given the frequent close contact between humans and animals in Africa, the apparent predominance of human-to-human transmission is both interesting and puzzling. In this article, after a brief “text book” introduction to the parasite, we consider in separate sections the different aspects of relevance to Cryptosporidium transmission in African countries, describing different aspects of the various species and subtypes in human and animal infections, considering livestock management practices in different African countries, and looking for any characteristic “hot spots” where zoonotic transmission has apparently occurred. Studies where transmission networks have been investigated are particularly relevant. Finally, in a separate section, we try to gather these different strands of evidence together in order to assess the reasons behind the apparent predominance of anthroponotic transmission in Africa. Reviewing the available evidence provides an opportunity to re-think transmission pathways, not only in Africa but also elsewhere, and also to pose questions. Does the predominance of human-to-human transmission in Africa reflect a relative absence of zoonotic C. parvum in African livestock? Are Africans less susceptible to zoonotic Cryptosporidium infection, perhaps resulting from early immunostimulation by C. hominis or due to inherent genetic traits? Is the African environment—in all its variety—simply more detrimental to oocyst survival? Will the so-called hypertransmissible subtypes, currently relatively rare in Africa, be introduced from Europe or elsewhere, and, if so, will they fade out or establish and spread? Our intention with this manuscript is not only to summarize and consolidate diverse data, thereby providing an overview of data gaps, but also to provide food for thought regarding transmission of a parasite that continues to have a considerable impact on both human and animal health. © Copyright © 2020 Robertson, Johansen, Kifleyohannes, Efunshile and Terefe.},

	abstract = {We provide the first analysis and synthesis of the evolutionary and mechanistic bases for risk of endometriosis in humans, structured around Niko Tinbergen's four questions about phenotypes: phylogenetic history, development, mechanism and adaptive significance. Endometriosis, which is characterized by the proliferation of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus, has its phylogenetic roots in the evolution of three causally linked traits: (1) highly invasive placentation, (2) spontaneous rather than implantation-driven endometrial decidualization and (3) frequent extensive estrogen-driven endometrial proliferation and inflammation, followed by heavy menstrual bleeding. Endometriosis is potentiated by these traits and appears to be driven, proximately, by relatively low levels of prenatal and postnatal testosterone. Testosterone affects the developing hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, and at low levels, it can result in an altered trajectory of reproductive and physiological phenotypes that in extreme cases can mediate the symptoms of endometriosis. Polycystic ovary syndrome, by contrast, is known from previous work to be caused primarily by high prenatal and postnatal testosterone, and it demonstrates a set of phenotypes opposite to those found in endometriosis. The hypothesis that endometriosis risk is driven by low prenatal testosterone, and involves extreme expression of some reproductive phenotypes, is supported by a suite of evidence from genetics, development, endocrinology, morphology and life history. The hypothesis also provides insights into why these two diametric, fitness-reducing disorders are maintained at such high frequencies in human populations. Finally, the hypotheses described and evaluated here lead to numerous testable predictions and have direct implications for the treatment and study of endometriosis.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

These methods are of broad utility; for example, they may facilitate the engineering of ectopic overexpression of brown adipose tissue (BAT) mUCP-1 via UTMD-gene therapy into baboon SKM to achieve weight loss, hypophagia and immunometabolic improvement.

The limitations and deficiencies of current non-selection disease control methods (e.g., vaccination, treatment, eradication strategy, genome editing, and probiotics) make it difficult to effectively, economically, and permanently eliminate the adverse influences of disease in the farm animals. These limitations and deficiencies drive animal breeders to be more concerned and committed to dealing with health problems in farm animals by selecting animals with favorable health traits. Both genetic selection and genomic selection contribute to improving the health of farm animals by selecting certain health traits (e.g., disease tolerance, disease resistance, and immune response), although both of them face some challenges. The objective of this review was to comprehensively review the potential of selecting health traits in coping with issues caused by diseases in farm animals. Within this review, we highlighted that selecting health traits can be applied as a method of disease control to help animal agriculture industries to cope with the adverse influences caused by diseases in farm animals. Certainly, the genetic/genomic selection solution cannot solve all the disease problems in farm animals. Therefore, management, vaccination, culling, medical treatment, and other measures must accompany selection solution to reduce the adverse impact of farm animal diseases on profitability and animal welfare. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Pig farming is the integral component of farming system in the tribal dominated North Eastern region of India since pork is the most preferred meat among tribal population. However, pork still remains deficit and a high supply-demand gap exists due to low productivity of nondescript local pigs. In this context, popularization of crossbred pigs is the suitable option to enhance productivity. Thus, the study was carried out to evaluate the performance of crossbred pigs viz., Tamworth X Desi (T&D), Hampshire X Niang Megha (H&NM) in order to improve the pig productivity in the region. Methods: Data was collected from crossbred pigs viz., Tamworth X desi (T&D), Hampshire X Niang Megha (H&NM) and Niang Megha (NM) pigs which is maintained in the Pig breeding farm of the institute. This data included the study of productive (n=778 piglets), reproductive (n =107 sows) and carcass traits (n =45 slaughters) over a period of about eight years (2005-2013) from the farm record books cum-pedigree sheet of the pig farm. The date was analyzed suitable statistical tools. Result: The study recorded no significant differences (P<0.01) in pre weaning body weight, growth rate and mortality rate between T&D and H&NM crossbred pigs however, both the crossbred pigs revealed significantly (P< 0.05) higher pre weaning body weight and growth rate than that of NM pig. Post weaning body weight were significantly (P<0.05) highest in T&D crossbred pigs followed by H&NM crossbred pig as compared to NM pigs at all age groups. Farrowing rate were significantly (P<0.05) highest in NM pigs and lowest in T&D crossbred pigs. However, farrowing interval were significantly (P<0.05) highest in NM pig and lowest in H&NM crossbred pigs. Regarding litter size at birth and weaning, there was no significant (P<0.01) difference between T&D and H&NM pig but both these pigs revealed significantly (P<0.05) higher litter performance than NM pig. Back fat thickness and loin eye area were significantly highest in T&D pigs and lowest in NM pig. However, NM pig has significantly highest lean meat content than T&D and H&NM crossbred pig. There was no significant difference (P<0.01) observed of dressing percentage between T&D and H&NM crossbred pig but, both the genetic group yield significantly (P<0.05) higher dressing percentage than Niang Megha pigs. Based on the productive, reproductive and carcass traits, the study concluded that T&D pigs more suitable for fattener pig production due to their higher growth performance and carcass yield, whereas H&M pigs can be utilized for breeding purpose in subtropical hill ecosystem of Northeast India. © 2020 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Background: Coral reefs have sustained damage of increasing scale and frequency due to climate change, thereby intensifying the need to elucidate corals’ biological characteristics, including their thermal tolerance and microbial symbioses. The sea anemone, Exaiptasia diaphana, has proven an ideal coral model for many studies due to its close phylogenetic relationship and shared traits, such as symbiosis with algae of the family Symbiodiniaceae. However, established E. diaphana clonal lines are not available in Australia thus limiting the ability of Australian scientists to conduct research with this model. To help address this, the bacterial and Symbiodiniaceae associates of four Great Barrier Reef (GBR)-sourced E. diaphana genotypes established in laboratory aquaria and designated AIMS1–4, and from proxies of wild GBR E. diaphana were identified by metabarcoding of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and eukaryotic rRNA gene ITS2 region. The relationship between AIMS1–4 and their bacterial associates was investigated, as was bacterial community phenotypic potential. Existing data from two existing anemone clonal lines, CC7 and H2, were included for comparison. Results: Overall, 2238 bacterial amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were observed in the AIMS1–4 bacterial communities, which were dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, together comprising > 90% relative abundance. Although many low abundance bacterial taxa varied between the anemone genotypes, the AIMS1–4 communities did not differ significantly. A significant tank effect was identified, indicating an environmental effect on the microbial communities. Bacterial community richness was lower in all lab-maintained E. diaphana compared to the wild proxies, suggesting a reduction in bacterial diversity and community phenotypic potential due to culturing. Seventeen ASVs were common to every GBR lab-cultured anemone, however five were associated with the Artemia feedstock, making their specific association to E. diaphana uncertain. The dominant Symbiodiniaceae symbiont in all GBR anemones was Breviolum minutum. Conclusion: Despite differences in the presence and abundance of low abundance taxa, the bacterial communities of GBR-sourced lab-cultured E. diaphana are generally uniform and comparable to communities reported for other lab-cultured E. diaphana. The data presented here add to the global E. diaphana knowledge base and make an important contribution to the establishment of a GBR-sourced coral model organism. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Climate change can adversely affect rice production, especially for weed management in the context of emergence and proliferation of newer weed species like weedy rice (Oryza sativa f. spontanea) in the rice growing tracts of Kerala. In the past decade, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has risen from 371.82 to 407.05 ppm from 2000 to 2018 which might have an impact on the competitive ability of a C3 plant like weedy rice. The competitiveness of weedy rice was studied in an open top chamber (OTC) under a CO2 concentration of 500 ppm (Chamber A), OTC without external CO2 supply (Chamber B), and open condition along with two popular cultivated rice varieties Uma and Jyothi with both air and soil temperature inside the chamber to the tune of 40-430C and 35-400C respectively. The study revealed a higher competitive potential of weedy rice in terms of tillering ability under elevated carbon dioxide as it responded well compared to cultivated rice varieties. There was a differential response of rice varieties to elevated CO2 conditions with medium duration variety responding well compared to short duration one. Compared to ambient conditions (chamber B and open condition), higher tillering was observed under elevated CO2 (chamber A) in which weedy rice tillered profusely (17.33) than cultivated rice species (9 and 11.33). There was a linear increase in plant height of weedy rice in chamber A (108.97 cm) during the initial stages and in chamber B (112.77 cm) during reproductive stages. The study evidenced that in the coming future, higher CO2 levels can stimulate biomass production of C3 weed like weedy rice with a greater increase in tillering which could be an important trait affecting inter specific competition. © 2021, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

	abstract = {Background: Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium that causes listeriosis mainly in immunocompromised hosts. It can also cause foodborne outbreaks and has the ability to adapt to various environments. Peptide uptake in gram-positive bacteria is enabled by oligopeptide permeases (Opp) in a process that depends on ATP hydrolysis by OppD and F. Previously a putative protein Lmo2193 was predicted to be OppD, but little is known about the role of OppD in major processes of L. monocytogenes, such as growth, virulence, and biofilm formation. Objectives: To determine whether the virulence traits of L. monocytogenes are related to OppD. Methods: In this study, Lmo2193 gene deletion and complementation strains of L. monocytogenes were generated and compared with a wild-type strain for the following: adhesiveness, invasion ability, intracellular survival, proliferation, 50% lethal dose (LD50) to mice, and the amount bacteria in the mouse liver, spleen, and brain. Results: The results showed that virulence of the deletion strain was 1.34 and 0.5 orders of magnitude higher than that of the wild-type and complementation strains, respectively. The function of Lmo2193 was predicted and verified as OppD from the ATPase superfamily. Deletion of lmo2193 affected the normal growth of L. monocytogenes, reduced its virulence in cells and mice, and affected its ability to form biofilms. Conclusions: Deletion of the oligopeptide transporter Lmo2193 decreases the virulence of L. monocytogenes. These effects may be related to OppD’s function, which provides a new perspective on the regulation of oligopeptide transporters in L. monocytogenes. © 2020 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science},

	abstract = {The Sardo-Modicana is a local cattle breed from Sardinia, Italy. No information about its dairy potential is available in the literature. This study investigated the genotype at the CSN3 gene and milk traits of the Sardo-Modicana cattle breed. Fifty-four cows were sampled for DNA extraction and genotyping at the κ-casein gene locus, CSN3. Forty individual milk samples were analyzed for milk composition, milk coagulation properties and cheese yield (CY%). All the Sardo-Modicana cows were BB homozygotes at CSN3. Hence, the results were compared with the other two local Sardinian breeds. Eighty-three Sarda and 21 Sardo-Bruna cows were genotyped, and the A allele was found (at frequencies of 0.416 and 0.405, respectively). As regards milk traits, the mean protein value was 3.74 g/100 mL, and the mean casein value was 2.98 g/100 mL. Total bacterial and somatic cell counts showed excellent levels of hygiene considering the extensive farming and hand milking. In addition, milk produced by Sardo-Modicana cows was characterized by favorable values of coagulation properties and cheese yield.

	abstract = {Given that accurately identifying pathogen vectors is vital for designing efficient mosquito control programs based on the proper surveillance of the epidemiologically important species, it has been suggested the complementary use of independently evolving genes and morphometric traits as a reliable approach for the characterization and delimitation of related species. Hence, we examined the spatial distribution of COI mtDNA and ITS2 rDNA variation from the historical perspective of Ochlerotatus caspius (Pallas, 1771) and O. dorsalis (Meigen, 1830), while simultaneously testing the utility of the two markers in integrative species delimitation when combined with phenotypic character analyses of larvae and adults. Despite the striking difference in haplotype diversity (high in COI mtDNA, low in ITS2 rDNA), no evident phylogeographic structure was apparent in the Palearctic O. caspius. The Holarctic O. dorsalis species was subdivided into two highly distinctive COI mtDNA phylogroups which corresponded to the Nearctic and Palearctic regions. Strong support for the independence of the two allopatric evolutionary lineages suggested that geographical barrier and climatic changes during Pleistocene caused vicariance of the ancestral range. COI mtDNA reliably distinguished O. caspius and O. dorsalis, while ITS2 rDNA yet again lacked the proper resolution for solving this problem. An integrative approach based on the larval and adult morphological traits have varying taxonomic applications due to their differential diagnostic values. Thus, by the implementation of an integrative taxonomic approach, we successfully detected species borders between the two epidemiologically relevant species and uncovered the presence of cryptic diversity within O. dorsalis. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Extensive summer grazing is a dairy herd management practice frequently adopted in mountainous areas. Nowadays, this activity is threatened by its high labour demand, but it is fundamental for environmental, touristic and economic implications, as well as for the preservation of social and cultural traditions. Scarce information on the effects of such low-input farming systems on cattle health is available. Therefore, the present case study aimed at investigating how grazing may affect the health status of dairy cows by using milk traits routinely available from the national milk recording scheme. The research involved a dairy herd of 52 Simmental and 19 Holstein × Simmental crossbred cows. The herd had access to the pasture according to a rotational grazing scheme from late spring up to the end of summer. A total of 616 test day records collected immediately before and during the grazing season were used. Individual milk yield was registered during the milking procedure. Milk samples were analysed for composition (fat, protein, casein and lactose contents) and health-related milk indicators (electrical conductivity, urea and β-hydroxybutyrate) using mid-infrared spectroscopy. Somatic cell count (SCC) and differential SCC were also determined. Data were analysed with a linear mixed model, which included the fixed effects of the period of sampling, cow breed, stage of lactation and parity, and the random effects of cow nested within breed and the residual. The transition from barn farming to pasture had a negative effect on milk yield, together with a small deterioration of fat and protein percentages. Health-related milk indicators showed a minor deterioration of the fat to protein ratio, differential SCC and electrical conductivity, particularly towards the end of the grazing season, whereas the somatic cell score and β-hydroxybutyrate were relatively constant. Overall, the study showed that, when properly managed, pasture grazing does not have detrimental effects on dairy cows in terms of udder health and efficiency. Therefore, the proper management of cows on pasture can be a valuable solution to preserve the economic, social and environmental sustainability of small dairy farms in the alpine regions, without impairing cows’ health. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the contribution of CD109 to lung tumorigenesis remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we identified that CD109 was upregulated in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma cells, and elevation of CD109 was correlated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Functionally, CD109 expression was crucial for EMT gene expressions, tumor invasiveness, and cancer stemness properties. Moreover, elevation of CD109 was accompanied by upregulation of the yes-associated protein (YAP) signature in metastatic lung cancer cells and lung cancer patients, and activation of YAP was demonstrated to participate in CD109-elicited EMT gene expressions and tumor invasiveness. Our study reveals the molecular mechanism underlying CD109 in lung tumor aggressiveness, and CD109 could be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic target for lung cancer patients. © 2020 by the authors.

The study was conducted at the Center for Environmental Farming systems at the Cherry Research Station, Goldsboro North Carolina. A continuous stocking method was implemented to manage the pasture. The percent ground cover was estimated with a modified step point technique. Soil samples were collected in three sampling positions (center, inner and outer areas of the paddocks) and two soil sampling depths (0–30 and 30–90 cm). The experimental design was a completely randomized block with three field replicates. Data were analyzed using the PROC GLIMMIX procedure of SAS/STAT® Version 9.4. Greater ground cover and lesser soil nutrient concentrations were registered in bermudagrass paddocks managed with 37 pigs ha−1. The results of this study also validated the existence of a spatial pattern of soil properties, which differed among sampling positions and depths. © 2020 by the authors.

Tumor suppressor genes are directly involved in cell growth and differentiation. Genetically inherited traits may be transmitted through Mendelian inheritance (e.g., autosomal-dominant, -recessive, or -codominant trait; X-linked trait) or non-Mendelian inheritance (e.g., uniparental disomy; expansion of trinucleotide repeats).

	abstract = {Analyses of the impacts of climate change on fish species have primarily considered dynamic oceanographic variables that are the output of predictive models, yet fish species distributions are determined by much more than just variables such as ocean temperature. Functionally diverse species are differentially influenced by oceanographic as well as physiographic variables such as bottom substrate, thereby influencing their ability to shift distributions. Here, we show that fish species distributions that are more associated with bottom substrate than other dynamic environmental variables have shifted significantly less over the last 30 years than species whose distributions are associated with bottom salinity. Correspondingly, species whose distributions are primarily determined by bottom temperature or ocean salinity have shifted their mean centroid and southern and northern range boundaries significantly more than species whose distributions are determined by substrate or depth. The influence of oceanographic versus static variables differs by species functional group, as benthic species distributions are more associated with substrate and they have shifted significantly less than pelagic species whose distributions are primarily associated with ocean temperatures. In conclusion, benthic fish, that are more influenced by substrate, may prove much less likely to shift distributions under future climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The presence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance encoding mcr gene family in the Enterobacteriaceae is one of the crucial global concerns. The use of colistin in livestock rearing is believed to be the cause of mcr gene spreading and is of impact to public health. The objective of this research was to detect the frequency and virulent genes of mcr-positive Escherichia coli (MCRPE) in fecal samples from healthy pigs in a contract farming system across Thailand. A total of 696 pooled samples were derived from 80 farms, located in 49 provinces across six regions of Thailand. The colistin-resistant E. coli were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and antimicrobial susceptibility testing by broth microdilution. The antibiogram was determined using an automated susceptibility machine, and the genetic characteristics were investigated for mcr-1–5 genes, phylogenetic group, replicon types, and virulent genes. In total, 31 of 696 samples were positive, with E. coli containing mcr-1 or combination of mcr-1 and mcr-3 with incidence of 4.45 and 0.43%. Phylogenetic groups A and B1 and the IncF and IncFIB replicon types were predominantly found in the MCRPE located in the central area, with multidrug-resistant traits against 3–14 types of antimicrobials. Additionally, 19 of 31 isolates identified as enterotoxigenic E. coli were with the stap and stb (enterotoxin-encoding genes). In conclusion, a low carriage rate of mcr-positive E. coli was detected in the large-scale farming of healthy pigs. The association between multidrug-resistant MCRPE and their pathogenic potential should be of concern. © Copyright © 2020 Khine, Lugsomya, Kaewgun, Honhanrob, Pairojrit, Jermprasert and Prapasarakul.},

	abstract = {Background: Wildlife traps are used in many countries without evaluation of their effect on animal welfare. Trap-capture of wild animals should minimise negative effects on animal welfare, irrespective of whether the animals are trapped for hunting, research, or management purposes. Live-trap capture of wild boar (Sus scrofa) followed by killing inside the trap by gunshot is a recently introduced but disputed hunting method in Sweden. Approval of trap constructions is based on gross necropsy findings of 20 trapped and shot wild boars. For improved animal welfare evaluation, our aim was to study wild boar behaviour during live-trapping in a 16 m2 square corral-style trap. Behavioural assessments were conducted after filming 12 capture events of in total 38 wild boars (five adults, 20 subadults, 13 piglets). Selected behavioural traits were compared with pathological changes (trap-related lesions) found at necropsy of the 20 subadults, to determine if these variables were useful proxies of capture-induced stress in wild boar. Results: The wild boars spent less time resting in the evening than in the night and morning. Using Friedman’s ANOVA, there was an overall difference in the time spent foraging. However, we only found a difference between the evening and morning in the Wilcoxon matched pairs test after the Sequential Bonferroni correction, where the wild boars spent more time foraging in the evening than in the morning. Single captured individuals showed more escape behaviours and reacted more strongly to external stimuli than individuals captured in a group. It was more common for animals to charge against the mesh walls of the trap upon human approach compared to upon initial capture when the trap door closed. Trap-related pathological findings due to trauma were documented in 13 of the 20 subadults that were necropsied. Behavioural alterations indicative of capture-induced stress (e.g. charging into the trap walls) were documented in trapped wild boars with no or minor physical injuries (e.g. skin abrasions, subcutaneous haemorrhage). Conclusions: Behavioural assessment provided valuable information for determination of capture-induced stress in wild boar when evaluating live-trapping in a corral-style trap, whereas pathological evaluation through necropsy did not fully reflect the animal welfare aspects of live-trapping. We emphasize the inclusion of species-specific behavioural data assessment for evaluation of capture-related stress during live-trapping and for testing of new trap constructions before approval. © 2020, The Author(s).},

This study was conducted to assess the growth performance, carcass characteristics and meat quality of lambs fed TMR pellet with PKM. A total of 32, three-month-old male lambs were randomly distributed into two diets (PTMR1= 0; PTMR2= 200 kg PKM/ton TMR). Results of the study showed that the production performance and the characteristics, composition and fat content of carcasses, as well as meat quality traits were not affected by PTMR2. The relative weight of the loin and tail and cohesiveness were lower while the index of myofibril fragmentation was higher when compared to PTMR1. The pH and color of the carcass and meat components were not significantly different except for hindquarter color (Lightness) and the ultimate meat pH in PTMR2. The pH value and tissue color (Redness) of rumen were higher when the lambs were fed with PTMR2 compared to PTMR1.

	abstract = {in the first parity), meat, fatness and growth traits (muscle depth, days to 100 kg and backfat thickness over 6–7 rib) was tested using single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction ssGBLUP methodology. These traits were selected as the most economically significant and different in terms of heritability. The heritability for meat, fatness and growth traits varied from 0.17 to 0.39 and for reproduction traits from 0.12 to 0.14. We confirm from our data that ssGBLUP is the most appropriate method of genomic evaluation. The validation of genomic predictions was performed by calculating the correlation between preliminary GEBV (based on pedigree and genomic data only) with high reliable conventional estimates (EBV) (based on pedigree, own phenotype and offspring records) of validating animals. Validation datasets include 151 and 110 individuals for reproduction, meat and fattening traits, respectively. The level of correlation (r) between EBV and GEBV scores varied from +0.44 to +0.55 for meat and fatness traits, and from +0.75 to +0.77 for reproduction traits. Average breeding value (EBV) of group selected on genomic evaluation basis exceeded the group selected on parental average estimates by 22, 24 and 66% for muscle depth, days to 100 kg and backfat thickness over 6–7 rib, respectively. Prediction based on SNP markers data and parental estimates showed a significant increase in the reliability of low heritable reproduction traits (about 40%), which is equivalent to including information about 10 additional descendants for sows and 20 additional descendants for boars in the evaluation dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Bees comprise a large group of over 20â€‰000 species that show a wide range of forms, habits, plant associations, and degree of social interactions. The steep decline in managed honey bee colonies in North America and Europe since the mid 2000s has precipitated a big investment on developing a better understanding of the diversity of life history traits among the non-Apis bees, their role in pollination services and how these species are responding to the rapid and multiple facets of environmental change. Here, I provide an overview of the evolutionary history of bees (where do they come from), their diversity (how many species and lineages), and their variation in social behavior and life cycles. Then, I discuss in what ways abiotic stressors such as land use change, pesticides, and climate warming are affecting populations of non-Apis bees. Last, I present a summary of the diversity, transmission routes and prevalence of the most common pathogens affecting non-Apis bees. This chapter provides a broader framework about the ecology and evolution of bees and their importance to assess and improve bee health. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Predator-released kairomones indicating the presence of predatory fish are known to alter the behaviour and life-history traits of several aquatic herbivores. Culex mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) respond to such cues by altering oviposition habitat selection and larval development time. These responses differ among fish species indicating composition differences among fish-released cues, but the recognition pattern is not clear. This study tested the dependence of fish recognition to co-evolution and the level of threat to larvae. We compared Culex responses to three fish, the invasive larvivorous Gambusia affinis (Cyprinodontiformes: Poeciliidae), the native larvivorous Aphanius mento (Cyprinodontiformes: Cyprinodontidae) and the native algivorous Garra rufa (Cypriniformes: Cyprinidae). The effects of cues released by the three fish on Culex oviposition and life-history shifts were compared in field mesocosms and lab tests. Our results showed that ovipositing females were significantly repelled only by cues originated from G. affinis, while developing larvae response was a more general one. Our results support the idea that fish-released kairomones differ in composition or quantities among different species. © 2020 The Royal Entomological Society},

	abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) serves as an integral component of eukaryotic membranes; however, its biosynthesis in apicomplexan parasites remains poorly understood. Here we show that Toxoplasma gondii—a common intracellular pathogen of humans and animals—can import and co-utilize myo-inositol with the endogenous CDP-diacylglycerol to synthesize PtdIns. Equally, the parasite harbors a functional PtdIns synthase (PIS) containing a catalytically-vital CDP-diacylglycerol phosphotransferase motif in the Golgi apparatus. Auxin-induced depletion of PIS abrogated the lytic cycle of T. gondii in human cells due to defects in cell division, gliding motility, invasion, and egress. Isotope labeling of the PIS mutant in conjunction with lipidomics demonstrated de novo synthesis of specific PtdIns species, while revealing the salvage of other lipid species from the host cell. Not least, the mutant showed decline in phosphatidylthreonine, and elevation of selected phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol species, indicating a rerouting of CDP-diacylglycerol and homeostatic inter-regulation of anionic phospholipids upon knockdown of PIS. In conclusion, strategic allocation of own and host-derived PtdIns species to gratify its metabolic demand features as a notable adaptive trait of T. gondii. Conceivably, the dependence of T. gondii on de novo lipid synthesis and scavenging can be exploited to develop new anti-infectives. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Gurez is an indigenous breed of sheep native to the Gurez Valley of J&K, India. Despite being a unique genetic resource, this breed is largely unexplored and meagre studies have been conducted on it. Hence, a comprehensive study was conducted to study the breed in its native breeding tract. Data on growth, wool, reproduction and morphometric traits of Gurez sheep maintained under farmers’ flocks in its native tract were recorded and analyzed for performance evaluation as well as the farming practices in that area with regards to the breed. Screening for parasites and brucellosis, blood biochemistry and mineral profile were also conducted. This triple purpose breed produces milk, meat as well as apparel quality wool. The average values for wool traits were 76.12, 28.31, 4.42, 5.35 and 8.18 for clean wool yield (CWY) (%), fibre diameter (FD) (µ), staple length (SL) (cm), crimps per cm (NCPC) and medullation (%), respectively. The coefficient of variations % of these traits ranged from low to very high indicating that the traits had low to very high variability. The least squares mean for clean wool yield (%), fiber diameter (µ), staple length (cm), crimps per cm and medullation (%) were 77.07±0.33, 29.83±0.41, 4.80±0.17, 5.04±0.28 and 9.26±0.79, respectively. The sexual dimorphism was observed in favour of males with respect to all these traits. Age had non-significant effect on these traits in the present study. Black wool samples were having higher estimates of FD, CWY (%), SL and medullation (%). NCPC was higher for white wool samples. Conservation of this unique breed and its selective breeding is highly recommended. The incidence of Eimeria (37.50%) was found to be highest in the area. © 2021 Indian Council of Agricultural Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the economic and environmental impacts of strategies that incorporated selection for pig feed efficiency and dietary optimization based on a single or multiple objectives tailored to meet the population nutritional requirements, with the goal to optimize sustainable farm feed efficiency. The economic and environmental features of the strategy were evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA) and bio-economic models. An individual trait-based LCA model was applied to evaluate global warming potential, terrestrial acidification potential, freshwater eutrophication potential (EP), and land occupation of the combined genetics and nutrition optimization to produce 1 kg of live pig weighing 120 kg at the farm gate. A parametric individual trait-based bio-economic model was developed and applied to determine the cost breakdown, revenue, and profit to be gained from a 120-kg live pig at the farm gate. Data from two genetic lines with contrasted levels of feed efficiency were used to apply the combined genetics and nutrition optimization: accounting for the average nutritional requirements for each line, the individual pig responses to diets formulated for least cost, least environmental impacts, or minimum combination of costs and environmental impacts objectives were predicted with INRAPorc. Significant differences in the environmental impacts (P < 0.0001) and profit (P < 0.05) between lines predicted with the same reference diet showed that selection for feed efficiency (residual feed intake) in pigs improves pig production sustainability. When pig responses were simulated with their line-optimized diets, except for EP, all the line environmental impacts were lower (P < 0.05) than with the reference diet. The high correlations of feed conversion ratio with the environmental impacts (> 0.82) and the profit (< -0.88) in both lines underlined the importance of feed efficiency as a lever for the sustainability of pig production systems. Implementing combined genetics and nutrition optimization, the inherent profit and environmental differences between the genetic lines were predicted to be reduced from 23.4% with the reference diet to 7.6% with the diet optimized jointly for economic and environmental objectives (joint diet). Consequently, for increased pig sustainability, diet optimization for sustainability objectives should be applied to cover the specific nutritional requirements arising in the herd from the pigs genetic level.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Researches towards Glioblastoma multiforme therapy (GBM) has been performed, especially in finding the tumor’s genetic cellular expression. The overexpression of EGFR, frequently found in human malignancies, is known to significantly impact cancer cells hallmark traits, such as increased cell survival, proliferation and invasion. This research is performed to figure out the synergistic effect of temozolomide, the main chemotherapy regimen used, and the monoclonal antibody anti-EGFR nimotuzumab in inhibiting the growth of GBM cells in vitro. Methods: We performed cell cultures using GBM U87MG cells and administered nimotuzumab 1000µg/ml and temozolomide 20 µg/ml in different sequences and timings. Inhibition of GBM cell growth is evaluated by measuring Ki-67 and γH2AX levels using flowcytometry and tested with one-way ANOVA. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 for Windows. Results: Levels of Ki-67 were in the control group (23.17±1.72), nimotuzumab monotherapy (15.43±1.70), temozolomide monotherapy (14.80±1.37), simultaneous therapy (10.73±1.19), nimotuzumab 24 hours before temozolomide (10.57±1.05), and nimotuzumab 48 hours before temozolomide (14.47±1.37). The level of γH2AX is measured in the control group (11.90±1.25), nimotuzumab monotherapy (29.33±1.91), temozolomide monotherapy (28.13±1.58), simultaneous therapy (41.53±3.51), nimotuzumab 24 hours before temozolomide (39.56±2.06), and nimotuzumab 48 hours before temozolomide (35.93±3.56). Conclusion: This research shows that administration of nimotuzumab simultaneously with temozolomide and nimotuzumab 24 hours before temozolomide effectively inhibits the growth of U87MG GBM cells. Inhibition of EGFR expression before temozolomide administration is able to increase DNA damage and inhibit the proliferation of glioma cells. © 2021, Sanglah General Hospital. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In the wild, particularly in rapidly changing conditions, being capable of solving new problems can increase an animal's chances of survival and reproduction. In the current context of widespread habitat destruction and increasing urbanization, innovativeness might be a crucial trait. In the past few decades, birds have proven to be a model taxon for the study of innovation, thanks to the abundant literature on avian innovation reports. Innovation databases in birds have been successfully employed to assess associations between innovativeness and other traits such as invasion success, life history, generalism, and brain encephalization. In order to more directly assess the causes of variation in innovation, a complementary approach consists in measuring innovativeness in wild-caught animals using problem-solving tasks that mimic innovations in the field. This method can allow for finer scale evaluation of ecological and neural correlates of innovation. Here, I review some of the most important findings on the correlates of innovation, with a particular focus on neural ones. I conclude by discussing avenues for future research, which I suggest should focus on neurobiology.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: To clarify whether awareness of the extent and severity of exposure to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the social networks of older adults is related to the engagement by the latter in self-protective behaviors. The inquiry is guided by the Health Belief Model and by concepts from the domain of social networks. Research Design and Methods: Data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) were used, including the SHARE COVID-19 Survey executed in the summer of 2020. The study sample numbered 33,053 persons aged 50 and older in 26 countries. We regressed a logged count of self-protective behaviors on network-exposure severity, controlling for sociodemographic background, country, personality traits, and self-exposure severity. Age and network-exposure interaction terms were examined, as were "close family"and "other"network ties. Results: Network-exposure severity was positively associated with the extent of engagement in self-protective behaviors among older adults, but mainly among the oldest group, aged 70 and older. Awareness of exposure severity in "close family"and "other"networks were similarly associated with self-protection. Respondents from countries with the lowest rates of COVID-19 infection at the time (Latvia, Finland, and Denmark) engaged in fewer self-protective behaviors, while those from countries with high infection rates (Spain, Italy, and Portugal) self-protected to a greater degree. Discussion and Implications: The study findings point to the role of the social network, even if indirect, in promoting self-protective behaviors among the oldest segment of society. Policymakers should collaborate with the social networks of older adults in order to promote the adoption of self-protective behaviors. Such intervention might help to reduce the threat of infection among the most vulnerable age group.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In the global warming context, plant adaptation occurs, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly described. Studying natural variation of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana adapted to various environments along an altitudinal gradient should contribute to the identification of new traits related to adaptation to contrasted growth conditions. The study was focused on the cell wall (CW) which plays major roles in the response to environmental changes. Rosettes and floral stems of four newly-described populations collected at different altitudinal levels in the Pyrenees Mountains were studied in laboratory conditions at two growth temperatures (22 vs. 15 °C) and compared to the well-described Col ecotype. Multi-omic analyses combining phenomics, metabolomics, CW proteomics, and transcriptomics were carried out to perform an integrative study to understand the mechanisms of plant adaptation to contrasted growth temperature. Different developmental responses of rosettes and floral stems were observed, especially at the CW level. In addition, specific population responses are shown in relation with their environment and their genetics. Candidate genes or proteins playing roles in the CW dynamics were identified and will deserve functional validation. Using a powerful framework of data integration has led to conclusions that could not have been reached using standard statistical approaches. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The slaughtering of entire males increases the probability of incidence of tainted pork due to the presence two main compounds—androstenone and skatole. If a surgical castration of young entire male pigs is stopped in the EU countries, fattening of boars is likely to become one of the most commonly used systems in pig farming. Since skatole production and accumulation in fat tissue can be controlled by dietary approaches, several studies have investigated various feed additives to reduce this compound of boar taint. Ones of the most promising is tannins. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of different dietary tannin level supplementation on carcass, pork quality, chemical, amino and fatty acid composition. as well as perception of boar taint and accumulation of skatole and androstenone in adipose tissue. Eighty entire males were randomly distributed to control (T0) and four experimental groups. Control pigs received standard feed mixture (16.8% CP, 13.9 MJ ME) without any tannin supplementation. Experimental pigs received the same diet with administration of 1% (T1), 2% (T2), 3% (T3) and 4% (T4)—sweet chestnut extract rich in hydrolysable tannins for 40 days (from average live weight of 80 kg until slaughter at average weight 122.28 kg ± 5.63 kg). Dietary tannins supplementation did not show any significant effect on chemical composition, cholesterol content, and amino acid composition of muscle as well as fatty acid composition and androstenone accumulation in adipose tissue. A slight or small effect was observed on carcass and meat quality, respectively. Pigs in groups T4 and/or T3-T4 had higher electrical conductivity in semimembranosus muscle and cooking loss value compared to T1, T2 or T0, T1, and T2 groups (p < 0.05). Tannins in the pig’s diet greatly affected fatty acid profile in meat of entire males. The highest tannin levels (4%) increased concentrations of lauric, myristic, vaccenic, linoleic, total PUFA, and n-6 PUFA in muscle compared to the control. Similar results were found in group T3 except for vaccenic, linoleic, and total PUFA. On the contrary, concentrations of heptadecanoic and oleic acids in groups T3 and T4 were lower than those in T1 and T2 groups. Perception of boar taint using „hot iron“ method (insertion a hot iron tip of soldering iron into adipose tissue) tended to decrease in T2 group compared with control. Skatole accumulation in fat tissue was reduced in groups T2-T4 at significance level (p = 0.052–0.055) compared to the control pigs. In summary, tannins supplementation had no effect on chemical and amino acid composition as well as fatty acid profile in adipose tissue, and only slight on carcass value. However, 4% concentration of tannins significantly increased content of some fatty acids compared to control group. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Owning multiple pharmaceutical functions, plant-derived tropane alkaloids, especially scopolamine, have been widely used in medicine. Significant progress has been made in the production of tropane alkaloids during the past decades via breeding and cultivation of Duboisia cultivates, which are rich in scopolamine. However, unpredicted effects of environmental conditions and the progressive impact of global climate change are two major challenges for sustainable production of these compounds in the near future. In vitro cultures offer a powerful alternative source of TA production which address the uncontrolled effects of environmental variables under field cultivation and most importantly ease manipulation of the culture systems to maximize productivity. However, low quality or quantity of certain TA is still one of the biggest challenges that limit applicability of in vitro cultures. As an evolutionary phenomenon, polyploidy has been known to impact almost all characteristics of a plant species including pharmaceutically important traits such as biomass production and secondary metabolism. However, application of polyploidy has been underestimated and unexplored in production of tropane alkaloids. Here, we review recent progresses in the application of polyploidy in improving the quantity and quality of TA production in plants and in vitro cultures of TA-producing plant species. We also discuss the future directions of the polyploidy research in this field. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

We synthesize key aspects of tick life history that enable ticks to persist, spread and impact human health, including a two-year life cycle, multiple transmission pathways and dependence on hosts for tick feeding, movement and pathogen transmission. We discuss modeling advances that incorporate these traits in the context of climate-driven variation in tick feeding phenology. For established pathogens, such as the Lyme disease agent in the United States, we disentangle the linkages between land use change, habitat fragmentation and host diversity influencing human risk of infection along an urbanization gradient. We propose a coupled natural-human system framework for tick-borne pathogens that accounts for nonlinear effects and feedbacks between the enzootic cycle and human spillover. A deeper understanding of the eco-bio-social determinants of these diseases is required to develop more effective public health interventions. © Oxford University Press 2021.},

	abstract = {Air pollution has become the world's single biggest environmental health risk of the past decade, causing millions of yearly deaths worldwide. One of the dominant air pollutants is fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is a product of combustion. Exposure to PM2.5 has been associated with decreased lung function, impaired immunity, and exacerbations of lung disease. Accumulating evidence suggests that many of the adverse health effects of PM2.5 exposure are associated with lung inflammation and oxidative stress. While the physical structure and surface chemistry of PM2.5 are surrogate measures of particle oxidative potential, little is known about their contributions to negative health effects. In this study, we used functionalized carbon black particles as surrogates for atmospherically aged combustion-formed soot to assess the effects of PM2.5 surface chemistry in lung cells. We exposed the BEAS-2B lung epithelial cell line to different soot at a range of concentrations and assessed cell viability, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Our results indicate that exposure to soot with varying particle surface composition results in differential cell viability rates, the expression of pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress genes, and protein carbonylation. We conclude that particle surface chemistry, specifically oxygen content, in soot modulates lung cell inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Tumor endothelial marker 7 (TEM7) is included in the endothelial cells of tumors as a greatly expressed protein. In previous studies, it has been confirmed that TEM7 is highly expressed in gastric cancer (GC) cells and related to tumor invasion and migration. However, the relationship between TEM7 gene expressions, prognostic and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte in GC is still unclear. Methods: We obtained the expression of TEM7 in GC tissues using Oncomine and TIMER databases and validated it using qRT-PCR. The effect of TEM7 on survival in patients with GC was explored through the Kaplan–Meier Plotter database. Univariate and multifactorial analyses of the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database were performed to explore the association of TEM7 expression with clinical traits. TIMER and GEPIA databases were used to analyze the relationship between TEM7 expression and immune infiltration. GSEA pathway enrichment in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) exposed possible ways. Results: An expression level of TEM7 was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues and related with unfavorable survival in GC. Univariate analysis of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database indicated that excessive level of TEM7 expression was linked with age, tumor grade and TMN classification, and multivariate analysis indicated that age and level of TEM7 expression were independent prognostic factors for a poor prognosis. The level of expression of TEM7 was positively related to tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells other than B cells in GC. In the end, GSEA pathway enrichment exposed possible ways related to immunity. Discussion: Our study indicates that TEM7 is a prognostic biomarker that makes the decision that the progression of GC and is connected with tumor immune infiltrates in GC. © 2021 Geng et al.},

A thematic discourse analysis of the tattoo narratives grouped them as (1) shared experiences with another species, (2) life experiences and semiotic production of meaning, (3) animal traits embedded in the process of identity formation, (4) animals representing a connection with other humans, or (5) experiences of and/or ideas about animals that represent a profound or transcendent experience. The tattoo narratives were examined in the context of theoretical frameworks associated with “symbolic interactionism” and “interspecies intersubjectivities” to understand how animals were perceived and engaged with. In contrast to how nonhuman animals are often used as objects of ridicule, or representations of inferiority and uncouthness in various discourses and mediums, the animal subjects of the tattoos discussed here are positively portrayed and incorporated into the bearers’ own identity. Participants merged ideas about humanity and animality in a manner not representative of a naturalistic ontology, but rather a form of anthropomorphism that is dichotomous with naturalism. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Native pig breeds originate from local, primitive breeds. In Poland the ‘Puławska’, ‘Złotnicka White’ and ‘Złotnicka Spotted’ pigs are considered native breeds. Pigs of such breeds possess many valuable traits inherited from primitive ancestors, including adaptation to local environmental conditions, feed resources and farming conditions. They are characterized by good indicators of breeding performance. Nowadays, these pigs are usually kept in individual and organic farms where they provide good fattening results even with less favourable nutrition and maintenance. Pigs of the ‘Puławska’ breed compared to the ‘Złotnicka’ one have a higher content of meat in the carcass, however still lower than in high-production breeds of pigs. Better slaughter value parameters can be achieved by cross-breeding of native pig breeds with conventional ones. Despite their lower meatiness, meat obtained from the native pig breeds is of good quality. Due to proper protein, water and fat content, as well as higher intramuscular fat content, meat obtained from native pig breeds is often used to produce premium quality meat products. Taking into consideration current Polish market requirements, increasing the population of native pig breeds seems challenging, but is possible in the production of traditional and regional food the popularity of which is growing. © 2021, Polska Akademia Nauk.

	abstract = {Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO-NPs) are abundantly utilized on a large scale in different applications due to positive attributes and cause environmental pollution that may affect not only aquatic organisms but also the human beings. The co-precipitation method was used to synthesize NiO-NPs and particles were characterized through Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis, Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). FTIR and SEM confirmed the attached functional group and crystal structure of synthesized nanoparticles, respectively. From XRD pattern, average particle size, X-ray density, lattice parameters (a, b and c) and volume of unit cell of nickel oxide nanoparticles were found to be 53.44 nm, 6.65 g/cm3, (a =b=c=4.56 Å) and 94.81 Å3, respectively. During this study, the acute toxicity of NiO-NPs was determined by using fish, Labeo rohita. The mean 96-h LC50 and lethal concentration were measured as 418.26 and 634.94 mg/L, respectively. The activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase was determined in fish gills and liver after chronic exposure to sub-lethal concentration of NiO-NPs for 90 days and sampling was done in 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 days. Significant time dependent variations in the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase were determined in tissues of the gills and liver than control group during studied time interval. The overall results indicated that induced toxicity of NiO-NPs in aquatic organisms may be due to release of Ni ions from NiO-NPs and NPs induce toxicity in cells through oxidative stress under long term exposure. ©2021 PVJ.

	abstract = {Awareness of the physiological changes that occur when animals are subjected to climatic changes that are considered stressful is essential to maintain animal welfare and to be able to exploit their reproductive potential efficiently and rationally. The present study was carried out to evaluate climatic variables' influence on physiological parameters, and Murrah buffalo ejaculates reared in a humid tropical climate in the Amazon. The immediate analyzes pertinent to the physical and morphological characteristics of the ejaculates were carried out and corresponded in the rainy season (RS) volume of 3.4±2.0mL; the mass activity of 4.4±0.5; motility of 80.4±5.6%; vigor of 4.4±0.4; concentration of 657,300±237,865.1 x 106sptz/mL; major defects of 9.0±2.6%; minor defects of 11.2±3.9%; total defects 20.2±5.3% and sperm plasma membrane integrity (SPMI) 84.8±5.6%, whereas in the non-rainy season (nRS), the results were 4.0±2.1mL; the mass activity of 3.0±1.0; motility of 56.2±13.4%; vigor of 3.0±1.0; concentration of 586,000±291,925.9 x 106sptz/mL; major defects of 20.8±9.9%; minor defects of 27.5±6.3%; total defects 48.3±9.3% and SPMI of 57.9±12.4%. Furthermore, a statistical difference (P<0.05) was observed for the parameters mass activity, motility, vigor, major defects, minor defects, total defects, and sperm plasma membrane integrity between both periods. The data on heart frequency, superficial temperature (head, back, groin, and scrotal pouch) showed a statistical difference between both periods (P<0.05). To conclude is necessary specific management in the non-rainy season that thermal stress is not a determining factor in reducing the reproductive quality of buffaloes; it is necessary to use means to improve animal welfare; one alternative is to use baths regularly for these animals or provide constant access to areas of rivers or lakes, as well as shading, preventing the buffaloes from being directly exposed to the unfavorable thermal environment. © 2020 Colegio Brasileiro de Patologia Animal.

	abstract = {The phenotypic characteristics of animals are result of the complex interaction of a number of genetic and non-genetic factors, which usually act simultaneously and it is difficult to determine the degree of influence of each of them. Early identification of the genetic traits of individuals enables more efficient management of selection. Fertility determins the cost-ef-fectiveness of sheep farming, regardless of productive direction. The individual fertility of the animals is determined by the number of lambs born per sheep. This trait is characterized by a low inheritance rate, hence conventional breeding methods shows slow progress. The introduction of new molecular-based technologies to improve productivity contributes to a greater and faster effect on the realization of animal genetic resources. The assessment of the breeding value of animals at the earliest possible age makes it possible to maximize the effect of the selection and to increase the use of animals with the highest genetic potential. The molecular markers and the application of RFLP-PCR method allow the determination of allelic variants of genes related to the quantity and quality of animal productivity. By identifying the different polymorphic variations and their phenotypic manifestation, a database can be accumulated to manage the genetic progression of economically important traits. Many mutations have been found in sheep that affect fertility and ovulation rates to varying degrees. Large number of mutations which affects ovulation have been found in genes expressing different proteins, such as the BMPR1B or FecB (Booroola gene or the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 1B), GDF9 or FecG (the growth differentiation factor 9b) and BMP15 or FecX (a bone morphogenetic protein 15). © 2021, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

	abstract = {Upregulation of lncRNA HOXA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP) plays important roles in cancer progression. Nevertheless, its functions in the growth and metastasis of ovarian carcinoma are unknown. In this study, we demonstrated overexpression of HOTTIP in ovarian cancer cell lines and clinical tissues. Further, we showed that higher level of HOTTIP was associated with poor survival of ovarian cancer patients. Notably, HOTTIP silencing restrained proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of ovarian carcinoma cells. On the other hand, upregulation of HOTTIP remarkably exacerbated the aggressive traits of ovarian carcinoma cells. In addition, HOTTIP served as a sponge of miR-615-3p to upregulate SMARCE1 level. Further, upregulation of miR-615-3p or downregulation of SMARCE1 reversed the carcinogenic impacts of HOTTIP in ovarian cancer. HOTTIP and miR-615-3p expression levels in ovarian cancer cells were negatively correlated, whereas HOTTIP and SMARCE1 expression levels were positively correlated. In nude mice, downregulation of HOTTIP reduced cell growth in vivo. In summary, lncRNA HOTTIP promotes the growth and metastatic phenotypes of ovarian cancer via regulating miR-615-3p/SMARCE1 pathway. © 2020 The Authors.

Life-history traits were compared between larvae from different hosts: the length of the larvae was measured by microscope image analysis, larval survival in water at 35 °C, larval susceptibility to ivermectin (EC50) in a migration assay, the proportion of larvae exsheathing in vitro and the proportion establishing to the adult stage in young lambs. For all traits there were significant differences between the host animals, with larvae from specific hosts following a consistent pattern of displaying the highest or lowest trait results. Compared with larvae from Host 1 the larvae from Host 5 were () shorter (741–692 μm, p < 0.05), had a longer median survival at 35 °C (3.6–6.4 days, p < 0.05), were less susceptible to ivermectin (EC50 of 1.2 v 4.5 μM, p < 0.05), exsheathed to a lesser degree (83.6–58 %, p < 0.05), but showed a higher establishment rate in the consecutive host (15.2–31.4 %, p < 0.05). Regarding the survival time, anthelmintic susceptibility (under most commercial farming practices) and establishment rate as indicators for fitness, the parasites populating Host 5 produced progeny of higher fitness.

Three species, Ae. rossicus, Cs. subochrea and Oc. cyprius were not collected, although Ae. rossicus was subsequently found in Lapland by another researcher. No invasive species were collected. Ochlerotatus communis, an aggressive biter, was the most commonly encountered species. Larval collection data suggest that several species may have up to three generations per year in Finland, with Cx. torrentium and Cx. pipiens having at least two, and Oc. communis and Oc. punctor regularly found as larvae across the summer.

	abstract = {Among abiotic stresses, drought influences plant growth and productivity, and plant stress responses depend on stress intensity and genotype. The effects of simulated drought stress on germination parameters were tested for tolerance and sensitivity in 59 barley accessions from all regions of Iraq and phenotypic, physiological, and biochemical responses associated with drought stress were investigated. Stress treatments with polyethylene glycol (PEG) reduced the germination rate and dramatically delayed the development of the seedlings. Significant changes in the physiological and biochemical profiles in barley accessions were observed. A smaller reduction in water absorption of seeds was observed across all accessions, while all biochemical characteristics except total flavonoid content were increased with the increase in water deficiency in most accessions. Among the 59 barley accessions, ABN was the most tolerant accession, while Black-Garmiyan was the most drought-prone. Significant relationships were found between most trait pairs, with 24 significant associations under no stress, 39 significant correlations under the 10.25% PEG treatment, and 60 significant correlations under the 20.50% PEG treatment. According to the key importance analysis, seed water uptake, total phenol content, soluble sugar content, and catalase are classified as relative significance traits for germination percentage, root and shoot length under stress conditions. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Most basal-like breast cancers (BLBCs) are triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which have the worst prognosis and distant metastasis-free survival among breast cancer subtypes. Now, no targeted therapies are available for patients with BLBC due to the lack of reliable and effective molecular targets. Here, we performed the BLBC tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical analysis and showed that Faciogenital Dysplasia 5 (FGD5) abundance is associated with poor prognosis in BLBCs. FGD5 deletion decreased the proliferation, invasion, and tumorsphere formation capacity of BLBC cells. Furthermore, genetic inhibition of Fgd5 in mouse mammary epithelial cells attenuated BLBC initiation and progression by reducing the self-renewal ability of tumor-initiating cells. In addition, FGD5 abundance was positively correlated with the abundance of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in BLBCs. FGD5 ablation decreased EGFR abundance by reducing EGFR stability in TNBC cells in 2D and 3D culture conditions. Mechanistically, FGD5 binds to EGFR and interferes with basal EGFR ubiquitination and degradation induced by the E3 ligase ITCH. Impaired EGFR degradation caused BLBC cell proliferation and promoted invasive properties and self-renewal. To verify the role of the FGD5-EGFR interaction in the regulation of EGFR stability, we screened a cell-penetrating α-helical peptide PER3 binding with FGD5 to disrupt the interaction. Treatment of BLBC patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice with the peptide PER3 disrupting the FGD5-EGFR interaction either with or without chemotherapy reduced BLBC progression. Our study identified FGD5 as a positive modulator of tumor-initiating cells and suggests a potential therapeutic option for the BLBC subtype of breast cancer.

	abstract = {The proliferation of invasive marine species is often explained by a lack of predators and opportunistic life history traits. For the invasive comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi, it has remained unclear how this now widely distributed species is able to overcome long periods of low food availability, particularly in their northernmost exotic habitats in Eurasia. Based on both field and laboratory evidence, we show that adult comb jellies in the western Baltic Sea continue building up their nutrient reserves after emptying the prey field through a shift to cannibalizing their own larvae. We argue, that by creating massive late summer blooms, the population can efficiently empty the prey field, outcompete intraguild competitors, and use the bloom events to build nutrient reserves for critical periods of prey scarcity. Our finding that cannibalism makes a species with typical opportunistic traits more resilient to environmental fluctuations is important for devising more effective conservation strategies. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Facing climate change implications on feeds unavailability, unconventional resources are being considered with a growing interest such as aromatic plant distillation residues with a two-fold object, enhancing meat quality by increasing the antioxidant properties and reducing feed prices which are often imported though expensive. Hence, this study aims to assess the effects of rosemary distillation residues (RR) incorporation in concentrate associated to two nitrogen sources as a substitute for standard concentrate on lamb’s growth, carcass traits and meat quality. For this, 24 Barbarine male lambs (3 months old, 17.83 ± 2.6 kg body weight) were divided into three groups. All lambs received individually 600 g of oat hay as roughage and 600 g of standard concentrate for control group, 600 g of concentrate based on RR and soybean meal for RRS group and 600 g of concentrate based on RR and faba bean for RRF group. After 65 days of experiment, all lambs were slaughtered. Phenolic and tocopherol intakes were significantly higher for both RR groups compared to control (p < 0.05). Growth, carcass weights, dressing percentages and non-carcass component weights were unaffected by the diet (p > 0.05). Moreover, regional and tissular compositions and meat physical properties were similar irrespective of the diet (p > 0.05). All color parameters were similar among groups (p > 0.05). However, meat produced by lambs receiving RR-based concentrate was richer on vitamin E and polyphenol contents than control lambs (p < 0.05). Rosemary by-products may substitute the standard concentrate resulting in similar lamb’s growth and carcass traits, while improving meat quality by increasing vitamin E content, which could improve its antioxidant power. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Physiological traits of wheat genotypes and their trait relation to drought conditions are important to identify the genotype in target environments. Thus, genotype selection should be based on multiple physiological traits in variable environments within the target region. This study was conducted at Punjab Agricultural University during rabi crop seasons 2012-13 and 2013-14 to study the recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of wheat genotypes derived from traditional landraces and modern cultivars (C518/2*PBW343) based on various morpho-physiological traits. A total of 175 RILs were selected for this study based on various tolerance indices. The genotype by trait (GT) biplot analysis was applied to data from seven high-yielding RILs grown under irrigated (E1) and rainfed environments (E2). The GGE biplot explained 100% of the total variation for chlorophyll content, grain filling period, peduncle length, water-soluble carbohydrates, grain number, grain yield, and 95.1% for canopy temperature, 94.9% for thousand-grain weight. GT-biplots indicated that the relationships among the studied traits were not consistent across environments, but they facilitated visual genotype comparisons and selection in each environment. RIL 84 and RIL108 were close to the average environment (ideal genotype) for all traits studied except chlorophyll content. A well-performing genotype with great environmental stability is called an "ideal genotype. Among all entries, these genotypes performed well. Therefore, among the traits studied, grain filling period, peduncle length, canopy temperature, water soluble carbohydrates, and 1000 grain weight contributed to grain yield under a stress environment. Furthermore, it may be used as a donor material in breeding programs and QTLs mapping. © 2021, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Organic farming techniques gained popularity recently. Despite this increasing demand, there are still many problems, when comparing nutrient sources in organic and conventional farming systems. The study had as objective to evaluate the development of blueberry plants cultivar ‘Climax’ under protected cultivation in a substrate with different proportions of organic material and doses of applied mineral N. The blueberry nursery plants ‘Climax’ were transplanted into plastic pots and kept under protected cultivation. The soil and sand proportions were 40 and 20%, respectively, of the volume capacity of each pot. The remaining 40% were filled with organic material (bovine manure) and sawdust in the proportions of 5 and 35% (S1), 20 and 20% (S2) or 35 and 5% (S3), respectively. The experimental design was in complete randomized blocks, and the treatments were distributed in a 3x3 factorial arrangement, with six replications. The first factor was the different formulations of substrates. The second factor was N fertilization at 0, 10, and 15 g N plant-1. Evaluations of canopy volume, total leaf area, chlorophyll content and gas exchanges were performed six and eighteen months after transplanting. Fruits were harvested according to their ripening. Higher proportions of organic material in the substrate showed a substantial increase on estimated leaf area, canopy volume, chlorophyll content and clear efficiency of carboxylation (A/Ci), especially in plants that was not fertilized with mineral N. The highest yield was reported for the substrate S2, with intermediary amount of organic material, without the application of mineral N fertilizer. Considering agronomic and physiological traits, blueberry plants on the substrate S2 (20% OM) showed the best results, without mineral N fertilizing, becoming viable the organic management system for potted ‘Climax’ blueberry plants under protected cultivation. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

The study was aimed to investigate polymorphism and find out associations between individual genotypes of the glutathione peroxidase 5 (GPX5) gene with reproduction and production traits in Niang Megha pigs. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP technique. Polymorphisms at the Intron 1 of the GPX5 gene were determined by using PCR-RFLP with HinfI restriction enzyme and DNA sequencing analyses. Two alleles and three genotypes were identified by HinfI digestion of the GPX5 gene. In the SNP-HinfI (g.1896A>G) locus did not find a significant association between GPX5 polymorphism with reproduction and production traits. However, the least square mean (LSM) values for the genotype GG demonstrated superior litter size and body weight as compared to AA and AG genotypes in the studied population. These findings emphasize the importance of the porcine GPX5 gene in the performance traits of pig. Therefore, the porcine GPX5 gene may be used as a potential candidate gene for the genetic improvement of litter size traits in the pig breeding industry. © 2021, Exploratory Animal and Medical Research.

	abstract = {The material for the study was the breast muscles of hens after the laying period which were marinated with buttermilk and acid whey for 24 and 48 h. The quality parameters of non-marinated and marinated raw and roast products were evaluated in respect of physical traits (marinade absorption, pH, colour L*a*b*, shear force, TPA texture profile analysis test), microbiological parameters and sensory characteristics. The microbiological parameters were determined as the total viable counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family and Pseudomonas spp. Bacterial identification was performed by MALDI-TOF MS. The study showed that marinating the breast muscles of hens after the laying period with buttermilk and whey lightened the colour (p < 0.05), decreased the shear force value (p < 0.05), and reduced hardness and chewiness (p < 0.05) both after 24 and 48 h of marinating compared to the control product. The 24-h time of marinating with buttermilk and whey inhibited (p < 0.05) the growth of aerobic bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. and had a positive effect on the desirable odour, the intensity and desirability of flavour as well as the roast product tenderness. Longer marinating time reduced the product palatability and decreased its microbiological safety.

	abstract = {An experiment was carried out with twenty genotypes in Kurdistan province in two growing season years. Grain yield was highest for the third group with 219.87 g/m2. Grain yield was the lowest in the first group (173.40 g / m2), which was not significantly different with the second group (191.22 g/m2). But in second crop year, the highest rate of radiation use efficiency related to the first group with 2.69. In contrast, the lowest radiation use efficiency was related to second and third groups with 2.57 and 2.54, respectively. The highest grains yield was observed in the second group with 315.40 g/m2 . In contrast, the lowest amount of grain yield was related to the third group with 253.75 g/m2 . Based on the results of biplot, in the first year of cultivation, high yield genotypes included ‘G14’ (263.00 g/m2 ), ‘G20’ (264.50 g/m2 ), ‘G18’ (214.00 g/m2 ) and ‘G19’ (222.50 g/m2 ) has a higher correlation with biologic yield, grain yield, radiation use efficiency, harvest index, root Length, number of panicles, 1000-grain weight, root dry weight and number of grain per panicle traits. In the second year of cultivation, high-yield genotypes included ‘G7’ (356.42 g/m2 ) and G9 (356.75 g/m2) have high correlation with number of grains per square meter trait. These results indicate that under stress conditions, more traits play a role in justifying the grain yield of wheat. © Articles by the authors; UASVM, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.},

The influences of elevated CO2 and higher temperature were identified using FTIR-PAS spectra by principal component analysis (PCA). Variations in the rice functional groups are crucial indicators for rice identification, and the ratio of the intensities of two selected spectral bands was used for correlation analysis with starch, protein, and lipid content, and the ratios all showed a positive linear correlation (R2 = 0.9103, R2 = 0.9580, and R2 = 0.9246, respec-tively). Subsequently, changes in nutritional components under future environmental conditions that encompass higher CO2 and temperature were evaluated, which demonstrated the potential of FTIR-PAS to detect the responses of rice to climate change, providing a valuable technique for agricultural production and food security. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Agonistic behavior after the regrouping of unfamiliar pigs has been recognized as one of the major welfare issues for pig husbandry, as it may result in lesions, lameness, and health problems. One scarcely investigated strategy to curb agonistic behavior is reducing the availability of visual stimuli potentially eliciting aggressions. In this study, we investigated the expression of agonistic behavior by growing pigs and the resulting accumulation of skin lesions over a period of 14 days following the formation of new social groups, which occurred in a condition of darkness maintained for 48 h. Compared to a simulated natural photoperiod (12 h light/day), darkness significantly reduced the number of skin lesions on the mid-and rear thirds of pigs’ body (p ≤ 0.01). A lack of corresponding decrease in frequency and duration of agonistic interactions suggests that darkness acts by decreasing the efficacy, not the expression, of aggressions. Furthermore, the location of lesions mostly affected by darkness indicates that the latter mostly acted by reducing the possibility of pigs to convey damage to a fleeing conspecific, rather than to one involved in a reciprocal fighting. The lighting regime provided did not affect growth performance traits of a 17weeks feeding trial. The present results identify in the provision of darkness an easily applicable, and relatively inexpensive intervention, that leads to the reduction of skin lesions. © 2020 by the authors.

The reference values were estimated from milk fatty acid profiles (chromatography), individual model-cheese, and daily milk yield of 1158 Brown Swiss cows (85 farms). Genetic parameters were estimated, under a Bayesian framework, for EME reference traits and their infrared predictions. Heritability of predicted EME traits were similar to EME reference values for methane yield (CH4 /DM: 0.232–0.317) and methane intensity per kg of corrected milk (CH4 /CM: 0.177–0.279), smaller per kg cheese solids (CH4 /SO: 0.093–0.165), but greater per kg fresh cheese (CH4 /CU: 0.203–0.267) and for methane production (dCH4: 0.195–0.232). We found good additive genetic correlations between infrared-predicted methane intensities and the reference values (0.73 to 0.93), less favorable values for CH4 /DM (0.45–0.60), and very variable for dCH4 according to the prediction method (0.22 to 0.98). Easy-to-measure milk infrared-predicted EME traits, particularly CH4 /CM, CH4 /CU and dCH4, could be considered in breeding programs aimed at the improvement of milk ecological footprint. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Cattle are among the most important farm animals that underwent an intense selection with the aim to increase milk production and to improve growth and meat properties, meanwhile reducing the generation interval allowing for a faster herd turnover. Recently, a shift from traditional breeding methods to breeding based on genetic testing has been observed. In this perspective, we review the techniques of molecular biology, genetics, and bioinformatics that are expected to further boost the agricultural potential of cattle. We discuss embryo selection based on next-generation and Nanopore sequencing and in vitro embryo production, boosting the potential of genetically superior animals. Gene editing of embryos could further speed up the selection process, essentially introducing a change in a single generation. Lastly, we discuss the host-microbiome co-evolution and adaptation. For example, cattle already adapted to low-quality low-cost fodder could be bred to achieve desired properties for the beef and dairy industry. The challenge of breeding and genetic editing is to accompany the selection on desired consumer-oriented traits with the push for sustainability and the adaptation to a changing climate while remaining economically viable. We propose that we are yet to see the limits of what is possible to achieve with modern technology for the cattle of the future; the ultimate goal will be to produce and maintain genetically elite individuals that can sustain the growing demands on the production. © 2021, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

	abstract = {Background: Free-range local chickens (FRLC) farming is an important activity in Tanzania, however, they have not been well-characterized. This study aimed to phenotypically characterize three Tanzanian FRLCs and to determine their population structure. A total of 389 mature breeder chickens (324 females and 65 males) from three popular Tanzanian FRLC ecotypes (Kuchi, Morogoro-medium and Ching'wekwe) were used for the phenotypic characterization. Progenies of these chickens were utilized to assess population structure. The ecotypes were collected from four geographical zones across Tanzania: Lake, Central, Northern and Coastal zones. Body weights and linear measurements were obtained from the mature breeders, including body, neck, shanks, wingspan, chest girth, and shank girth. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize the chickens. Correlations between the linear measurements and differences among the means of measured linear traits between ecotypes and between sexes were assessed. A total of 1399 progeny chicks were genotyped using a chicken 600 K high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel for determination of population structure. Results: The means for most traits were significantly higher in Kuchi relative to Ching'wekwe and Morogoro-medium. However, shank length and shank girth were similar between Kuchi and Morogoro-medium females. All traits were correlated with the exception of shank girth in Morogoro-medium. Admixture analyses revealed that Morogoro-medium and Ching'wekwe clustered together as one population, separate from Kuchi. Conclusions: Phenotypic traits could be used to characterize FRLCs, however, there were variations in traits among individuals within ecotypes; therefore, complementary genomic methods should be considered to improve the characterization for selective breeding.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The developmental environment can exert powerful effects on animal phenotype. Recently, epigenetic modifications have emerged as one mechanism that can modulate developmentally plastic responses to environmental variability. For example, the DNA methylation profile at promoters of hormone receptor genes can affect their expression and patterns of hormone release. Across taxonomic groups, epigenetic alterations have been linked to changes in glucocorticoid (GC) physiology. GCs are metabolic hormones that influence growth, development, transitions between life-history stages, and thus fitness. To date, relatively few studies have examined epigenetic effects on phenotypic traits in wild animals, especially in amphibians. Here, we examined the effects of exposure to predation threat (alarm cues) and experimentally manipulated DNA methylation on corticosterone (CORT) levels in tadpoles and metamorphs of the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina). We included offspring of toads sampled from populations across the species' Australian range. In these animals, exposure to chemical cues from injured conspecifics induces shifts in developmental trajectories, putatively as an adaptive response that lessens vulnerability to predation. We exposed tadpoles to these alarm cues, and measured changes in DNA methylation and CORT levels, both of which are mechanisms that have been implicated in the control of phenotypically plastic responses in tadpoles. To test the idea that DNA methylation drives shifts in GC physiology, we also experimentally manipulated methylation levels with the drug zebularine. We found differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between control tadpoles and their full-siblings exposed to alarm cues, zebularine, or both treatments. However, the effects of these manipulations on methylation patterns were weaker than clutch (e.g., genetic, maternal, etc.) effects. CORT levels were higher in larval cane toads exposed to alarm cues and zebularine. We found little evidence of changes in DNA methylation across the GC receptor gene (NR3C1) promoter region in response to alarm cue or zebularine exposure. In both alarm cue and zebularine-exposed individuals, we found differentially methylated DNA in the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 gene (SOCS3), which may be involved in predator avoidance behavior. In total, our data reveal that alarm cues have significant impacts on tadpole physiology, but show only weak links between DNA methylation and CORT levels. We also identify genes containing DMRs in tadpoles exposed to alarm cues and zebularine, particularly in range-edge populations, that warrant further investigation. © The Author(s) 2020.

The length-weight relationships were established as W = 0.029486L2.881638 and W = 0.058499L2.661735 for male and female. Differential growth in length-weight between male and female of O. niloticus were significant (p < 0.05), with a greater slope (b) value for male (2.88) than female (2.66). The t statistics estimated for the regression coefficients (b) were significant at 5% level of significance (p < 0.05), indicating an allometric growth pattern.

	abstract = {Haemosporidian parasites of the genera Plasmodium, Leucocytozoon, and Haemoproteus are one of the most prevalent and widely studied groups of parasites infecting birds. Plasmodium is the most well-known haemosporidian as the avian parasite Plasmodium relictum was the original transmission model for human malaria and was also responsible for catastrophic effects on native avifauna when introduced to Hawaii. The past two decades have seen a dramatic increase in research on avian haemosporidian parasites as a model system to understand evolutionary and ecological parasite-host relationships. Despite haemosporidians being one the best studied groups of avian parasites their specialization among avian hosts and variation in prevalence amongst regions and host taxa are not fully understood. In this review we focus on describing the current phylogenetic and morphological diversity of haemosporidian parasites, their specificity among avian and vector hosts, and identifying the determinants of haemosporidian prevalence among avian species. We also discuss how these parasites might spread across regions due to global climate change and the importance of avian migratory behavior in parasite dispersion and subsequent diversification. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The accuracy of prediction by indicator traits and their combinations were compared to predict the economically relevant traits fiber diameter and cashmere fleece weight using a Best Linear Prediction method. Direct selection for fiber diameter resulted 0.39 µm decrease in fiber diameter, however, cashmere fleece weight hardly changed (-2.90 g) per generation. In contrast, using all traits in selection criteria, fiber diameter expected to decrease by 0.41 µm per generation due to the enhanced accuracy of prediction. The conclusion of this study was (i) estimated breeding values should be developed for fiber diameter, a major determinant of cashmere price, for every breeding buck and doe and (ii) economic selection indexes could simultaneously improve two genetically antagonistic and economically relevant traits in cashmere production system. © 2019},

	abstract = {Mosquitoes pose an increasing risk in urban landscapes, where spatial heterogeneity in juvenile habitat can influence fine-scale differences in mosquito density and biting activity. We examine how differences in juvenile mosquito habitat along a spectrum of urban infrastructure abandonment can influence the adult body size of the invasive tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae). Adult Ae. albopictus were collected across 3 yr (2015-2017) from residential blocks in Baltimore, MD, that varied in abandonment level, defined by the proportion of houses with boarded-up doors. We show that female Ae. albopictus collected from sites with higher abandonment were significantly larger than those collected from higher income, low abandonment blocks. Heterogeneity in mosquito body size, including wing length, has been shown to reflect differences in important traits, including longevity and vector competence. The present work demonstrates that heterogeneity in female size may reflect juvenile habitat variability across the spatial scales most relevant to adult Aedes dispersal and human exposure risk in urban landscapes. Previous work has shown that failure to manage abandonment and waste issues in impoverished neighborhoods supports greater mosquito production, and this study suggests that mosquitoes in these same neighborhoods could live longer, produce more eggs, and have different vector potential. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

	abstract = {Simmental-Angus calves [n = 135; 72 steers and 63 heifers; body weight (BW) = 212.4 kg ± 36.1] were early weaned (~5 mo) to evaluate multiple feeding regimens (conventional vs. aggressive energy diets ± Megasphaera elsdenii NCIMB 41125 (M. elsdenii culture (MEC); Lactipro Advance; MS Biotec Inc., Wamego, KS) in order to elucidate the optimal development strategy. Objectives were measured by tracking the effects of caloric density and oral drenching of growing phase performance and subsequent carcass traits. The 72-d experiment featured three groups: 1) control (CON), fed exclusively a 35% roughage diet; 2) aggressive (AGR), fed a blend of a 10% and 35% roughage diets; 3) MEC, fed the same diet as AGR and drenched with 50 mL of M. elsdenii NCIMB 41125 on day 1. A subset of calves (n = 45) was equipped with wireless rumination tags (Allflex Flex Tag; SCR Engineers, Ltd; Netanya, Israel), which logged daily rumination and general activity. Skeletal growth variables were assessed by measuring wither and hip height pretrial and post-trial. Ultrasonography provided additional resolution concerning growing phase compositional gain, which was later verified by carcass data collection. Data were analyzed as a nested analysis of variance with BW and gender serving as blocking factors. The increased caloric density of the diets administered to MEC and AGR calves resulted in greater average daily gain and gain:feed values compared with CON even during the first 21 d of diet acclimation (P ≤ 0.05). Additional fiber concentration of CON diets led to increased rumination times in 9 of the 10 wk of trial (P ≤ 0.10). No differences amongst treatments were detected for skeletal variables or ultrasound 12th rib fat. Cattle fed CON diets posted 3.4% inferior BW at the end of the growing period trial and a 3.8% reduction in hot carcass weight (HCW), reinforcing the theory that intensifying caloric intake during the growing phase does not compromise future feedlot performance. Ultrasound marbling scores for MEC-treated cattle were 19° greater than AGR treated cattle (P ≤ 0.05) at the end of the growing phase trial. Nearly the exact same advantage (22°) was observed in the cooler 5 mo later (P = 0.42). Implying MEC metabolically imprinted cattle to favor marbling development. It appears that maximizing dietary caloric density in light-weight calves does not adversely affect the growth curve, while oral dosing of MEC during the growing period may be a precursor for enhanced quality grade. © The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Background: Heat stress derived from global warming is causing major economic losses in the livestock industry. Objective: To develop a novel methodological approach for determining the influence of climatic factors on the estimation of genetic parameters for growth traits in Retinta cattle breed by using reaction-norm models. Methods: Live weight records (n=7,753) from 3,162 Retinta calves born from 1,249 dams and 85 sires and raised in the Andalusian region (Spain) were analyzed. The effect of heat stress was measured using the temperature-humidity index, calculated with climatological data obtained from four weather stations. A bivariate-random-regression reaction-norm model was used to estimate the (co)variance components of weight until weaning in two different climatic seasons corresponding to warm and cold months. Results: The heritability pattern of individuals reared under diverse environments during the first 90 days of age was different. However, differences were not significant at the end of the growing period. Weaned calves reared during the cold season showed greater growth from 70 to 160 days in comparison with those reared during the warm season. Conclusions: Highly significant evidence of genotype-climatic condition interaction was found during the calf´s first three months of growth. © 2020, Universidad de Antioquia. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare the thermotolerance of second-cross (SC; Poll Dorset × Merino × Border Leicester) and Dorper lambs. Dorper and SC lambs (4–5 months of age) were subjected to cyclic heat stress (HS) (28–40◦C). The temperature was increased to 38–40◦C between 800 and 1700 h daily and maintained at 28◦C for the remainder of the day (30–60% relative humidity (RH)) in climatic chambers for 2 weeks (n = 12/group), with controls maintained in a thermoneutral (TN) (18–21◦C, 40–50% RH) environment (n = 12/group). Basal respiration rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT) and skin temperature (ST) were higher (p < 0.01) in SC lambs than in Dorpers. HS increased RR, RT and ST (p < 0.01) in both genotypes, but the levels reached during HS were lower (p < 0.01) in Dorpers. HS increased (p < 0.01) water intake to a greater extent in SC lambs, while feed intake was reduced (p < 0.05) by HS in SC lambs but not in Dorpers. HS increased (p < 0.01) blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in SC lambs only. Plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentrations were reduced (p < 0.05) by HS in SC lambs but increased (p < 0.05) in Dorpers. There was no effect of HS on pO2, cHCO3− and cSO2, but higher (p < 0.01) blood pH and lower (p < 0.01) pCO2 were recorded under HS in both genotypes. Blood electrolytes and base excess were reduced (p < 0.01) under HS, while a genotype difference (p < 0.05) was only observed in blood K+ and hemoglobin concentrations. Basal plasma prolactin concentrations were lower (p < 0.01) in Dorpers but were elevated at a similar level during HS (p < 0.01) in both genotypes. Dorper lambs are more resilient to HS than SC lambs. Future research should focus on confirming whether the better heat tolerance of Dorpers is translated to better returns in terms of growth performance and carcass traits over the summer months. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Periodontitis has low-prevalence, highly severe disease manifestations with an early onset and rapid progression. The diagnosis is based on severe destruction of the alveolar bone in adolescents and young adults. Genetic susceptibility variants and smoking are well-established risk factors, but their interactions in modifying disease susceptibility have not been studied. We aimed to identify genetic risk variants of early-onset periodontitis that unmask their effects on tobacco smoke exposure. To this end, we analyzed 79,780,573 common variants in 741 northwest Europeans diagnosed to have >30% bone loss at >2 teeth before 35 y of age, using imputed genotypes of the OmniExpress BeadChip. Never versus ever smokers were compared in a logistic regression analysis via a case-only approach. To explore the effect of tobacco smoke on the expression of the G×S-associated genes, cultures of primary gingival fibroblasts (n = 9) were exposed to cigarette smoke extract, and transcripts were quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We identified 16 loci for which our analysis suggested an association with G×S increased disease risk (P < 5 × 10−5). Nine loci had previously been reported to be associated with spirometric measures of pulmonary function by an earlier G×S genome-wide association study. Genome-wide significant cis expression quantitative trait loci were reported for G×S-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms at ST8SIA1 and SOST, indicating a causal role of these genes in tobacco-related etiopathology. Notably, SOST is a negative regulator of bone growth, and ST8SIA1 has a role in tissue remodeling. Cigarette smoke extract significantly altered the expression of 2 associated genes: SSH1 (P = 5 × 10−07), which is required for NF-κB activation and innate immune responses to bacterial invasion, and ST8SIA1 (P = 0.0048). We conclude that the genetic predisposition to early-onset periodontitis is in part triggered by smoking and that tobacco smoke directly affects the expression of genes involved in bone homeostasis, tissue repair, and immune response. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2019.},

Most of their behavior is mediated by vision. Lighting is considered an important exogenous environmental factor that directly affects bird well-being. In broilers, light stimulates and controls feed intake and so affects growth. Recent developments in lighting technology open new possibilities for enhancing the traditional lighting programmes inside poultry houses. Artificial lighting has 3 main aspects: light intensity (brightness), lighting duration (photoperiod), and wavelength (color). The color of light, dictated by the wavelength, exerts variable effects on poultry performance. More than 50% of the broiler studies indicated that blue (450 nm) and green light (550 nm) had positive effects on body weight (>3%), whereas red light (700 nm) increased activity and aggressive behavior of birds (>30%), negatively affecting body weight. Behavioral parameters of broiler chickens, in general, were affected significantly by light colors, whereas slight influences were shown on welfare parameters. This review integrates recent aspects of lighting usage that could influence traits of interest in poultry farming. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The poultry industry needs efficient antibiotic alternatives to prevent necrotic enteritis (NE) infections. Here, we evaluate the effects of probiotic and/or prebiotic dietary supplementation on performance, meat quality and carcass traits, using only an NE coinfection model, in broiler chickens. Three hundred and twenty-four healthy Ross 308 broiler chicks are allocated into six groups. Taking a 35 d feeding trial, the chicks are fed a basal diet with 0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.12, 0.5 + 0.12, and 0.2 g Kg−1 for the control (T1), Avilamycin (Maxus; T2), live probiotic (CloStat (Bacillus subtilis);T3), natural phytobiotic compounds (Sangrovit Extra (sanguinarine and protopine); T4), CloStat + Sangrovit Extra (T5), and spore probiotic strain (Gallipro Tect (Bacillus subtilis spores); T6) treatments, respectively. Occurring at 15 days-old, chicks are inoculated with Clostridium perfringens. The obtained results reveal that all feed additives improve the performance, feed efficiency, and survival rate, and reduces the intestinal lesions score compared with the control group. The T6 followed by T3 groups show a significant (p < 0.05) increase in some carcass traits, such as dressing, spleen, and thymus percentages compared with other treatments. Also, T5 and T6 have significantly recorded the lowest temperature and pHu values and the highest hardness and chewiness texture values compared to the other treated groups. To conclude, probiotics combined with prebiotic supplementation improves the growth, meat quality, carcass characterization and survival rate of NE-infected broiler chickens by modulating gut healthconditions and decreasing lesion scores. Moreover, it could be useful as an ameliorated NE disease alternative to antibiotics in C. perfringens coinfected poultry. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Oaks are the foundation and dominant tree species of most Mediterranean forests. As climate models predict dramatic changes in the Mediterranean basin, a better understanding of the ecophysiology of seed persistence and germination in oaks could help define their regeneration niches. Tunisian oaks occupy distinct geographical areas, which differ in their rainfall and temperature regimes, and are thus a valuable model to investigate relationships between seed traits and species ecological requirements. Methods Seed morphological traits, desiccation sensitivity level, lethal freezing temperature, embryonic axis and cotyledon sugar and lipid composition, and seed and acorn germination rates at various constant temperatures were measured in Quercus canariensis, Q. coccifera, Q. ilex and Q. suber, using seeds sampled in 22 Tunisian woodlands. Key Results Only faint differences were observed for desiccation sensitivity in the oak species studied. By contrast, the species differed significantly in sensitivity to freezing, germination rates at low temperature and base temperature. Quercus ilex and Q. canariensis, which occur at high elevations where frost events are frequent, showed the lowest freezing sensitivity. A significant correlation was found between hexose contents in the embryonic axis and freezing tolerance. Significant interspecific differences in the time for seeds to germinate and the time for the radicle to pierce the pericarp were observed. The ratio of pericarp mass to acorn mass differed significantly among the species and was negatively correlated with the acorn germination rate. Quercus coccifera, which is frequent in warm and arid environments, showed the highest acorn germination rate and synchrony. Conclusions Seed lethal temperature, seed germination time at low temperatures, the ratio of pericarp mass to acorn mass and the embryonic axis hexose content appeared to be key functional traits that may influence the geographical ranges and ecological requirements of Mediterranean oaks in Tunisia.  © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Early drought is a major constraint for cultivating wheat crop in the semi-arid region resulted in poor emergence and weak seedlings and might lead to a complete crop failure under severe drought. The response of eight wheat varieties to simulated osmotic stress was assessed using 10% and 15% polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000), in addition to the control treatment (no stress). Water stress during germination had no effect on the final germination percentages, but it delayed germination with signifi-cant differences among genotypes. Results showed that severe osmotic stress (15% PEG) substantially delayed germination; however, mild osmotic stress (10% PEG) had a little effect on germination rate. Furthermore, the results of this study showed that the fastest germinating varieties regardless of osmotic stress level were Acsad 65, Cham I and Ammon. Assessment of coleoptiles and seminal roots demonstrated that HoraniNawawi and Omqais varieties had the longest coleoptiles while Acsad 65 and BaniSuef 6 had the longest seminal roots. The pattern of response of wheat genotypes to osmotic water stress showed substantial differences at the early stage of plant development. Genotypes with a fast germination and a more vigorous root system are very desirable for the rapid establishment of seedlings and their early vigor in the dry areas. © 2020, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

We argue that understanding interactive effects between forest pathogens and global warming, globalization, and land-use changes may benefit from a functional ecology mindset. Traits can be more informative about ecological functions than species inventories and may deliver a more mechanistic description of forest disease. Myriad microbes with pathogenic potential interact with forest ecosystems at different organizational levels. Elucidation of functional traits may enable the microbial complexity to be reduced into manageable categories with predictive power. In this review, we propose guidelines that allow the research community to develop a functional forest pathology approach. We suggest new angles by which functional questions can be used to resolve burning issues on tree disease. Building up functional databases for pathogenicity is key to implementing these approaches. © 2020 Annual Reviews Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental evidence demonstrated the capability of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to bind sialic acid molecules, which was a trait not present in SARS-CoV and could shed light on the molecular mechanism used by the virus for the cell invasion. This peculiar feature has been successfully predicted by in-silico studies comparing the sequence and structural characteristics that SARS-CoV-2 shares with other sialic acid-binding viruses, like MERS-CoV. Even if the region of the binding has been identified in the N-terminal domain of Spike protein, so far no comprehensive analyses have been carried out on the spike-sialic acid conformations once in the complex. Here, we addressed this aspect performing an extensive molecular dynamics simulation of a system composed of the N-terminal domain of the spike protein and a sialic acid molecule. We observed several short-lived binding events, reconnecting to the avidic nature of the binding, interestingly occurring in the surface Spike region where several insertions are present with respect to the SARS-CoV sequence. Characterizing the bound configurations via a clustering analysis on the Principal Component of the motion, we identified different possible binding conformations and discussed their dynamic and structural properties. In particular, we analyze the correlated motion between the binding residues and the binding effect on the stability of atomic fluctuation, thus proposing regions with high binding propensity with sialic acid.

	abstract = {Cellulose constructed by microbial culture is called as bacterial cellulose (BC). BC has a high purity with no lignin, pectin, and hemicellulose commonly found in plant cellulose and also has a high degree of crystallinity so that the microfiber contained in it is tightly bound together and forms robust and elastic webbing. This study aims to provide a face mask sheet, wherein the sheets are made from BC, which is obtained from the fermentation of coconut water using Acetobacter xylinum. The plant extracts used were green tea leaf extract (Camellia sinensis), roselle flower petals (Hibiscus sabdariffa), and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. flower extract (a red and pink variant of color). The antioxidant assay using the DPPH test for the BC with plant extracts was evaluated. The result showed that the highest antioxidant activity was owned by BC green tea extract (IC50 80.9 ppm), followed by BC red hibiscus extract (IC50 438.8 ppm), BC roselle extract (IC50 505.1 ppm), and BC pink hibiscus extract (IC50 1015 ppm). Antibacterial testing was carried out using Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The growth of bacteria incubated in BC extract with 37oC for 24 hours was carried out by optical density reading (OD) at 600 nm with ELISA microplate reader. The results obtained showed that, with extract concentrations between 125 and 500 ppm, BC roselle extract had the highest inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa and E. coli. The BC plant extracts were also characterized using SEM, FTIR, and X-ray diffraction technique for their morphological structure, functional groups, and crystallinity. This result showed that BC with the addition of plant extracts is a promising candidate for mask sheet application with natural antioxidant and antibacterial activity. © 2020 Hanna Ivanivna Severina et al.},

Various plant traits that might result in yield increases in water-limited environments have been discussed for decades. Conservative use of soil water is an important breeding strategy in drought-prone environments that can be achieved by traits based on partial stomatal closure under specific environmental conditions to limit transpiration rate (TR). The focus of this review is on a specific trait for conservative soil water that results in partial stomatal closure that can be supported by a plant. This limit on TR is expressed in terms of the atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD) at which partial stomatal closure occurs. The review provides the physiological background of partial stomatal closure under elevated VPD. Simulation studies that analyse the potential benefits of this trait are also discussed. Finally, we provide a review of the various research that has been made in the identification of genetic variability of this trait in major crops. © CAB International 2019},

	abstract = {Studies have shown that antibiotic resistance among wild animals is becoming a public health concern, owing to increased contact and co-habitation with domestic animals that, in turn, results in increased human contact, indirectly and directly. This type of farming practice intensifies the likelihood of antibiotic resistant traits in microorganisms transferring between ecosystems which are linked via various transfer vectors, such as rivers and birds. This study aimed to determine whether the practice of wildlife supplementary feeding could have an influence on the antibiotic resistance of the bacteria harboured by the supplementary fed wildlife, and thus play a potential role in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance throughout nature. Escherichia coli and Enterococcus were isolated from the faeces of various wildlife species from seven different farms across South Africa. The Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method was used according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2018 guidelines. The E. coli (F: 57%; N = 75% susceptible) and Enterococcus (F: 67%; N = 78% susceptible) isolates from the supplementary fed (F) wildlife were in general, found to be more frequently resistant to the selection of antibiotics than from those which were not supplementary fed (N), particularly towards tetracycline (E.coli F: 56%; N: 71% / Enterococcus F: 53%; N: 89% susceptible), ampicillin (F: 82%; N = 95% susceptible) and sulphafurazole (F: 68%; N = 98% susceptible). Interestingly, high resistance towards streptomycin was observed in the bacteria from both the supplementary fed (7% susceptible) and non-supplementary fed (6% susceptible) wildlife isolates. No resistance was found towards chloramphenicol and ceftazidime. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Pleomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1) belongs to the PLAG family of zinc finger transcription factors. In cattle, a 19-bp insertion/deletion (indel) was identified in intron 1 of the PLAG1 gene (GenBank Accession No. AC_000171.1). Researches showed that the indel is polymorphic in Chinese cattle breeds such as Qinchuan cattle, Pinan cattle, Xianan cattle, and Jiaxian red cattle, and correlation analysis showed that the polymorphism is related to the height of these cattle breeds. Chinese cattle breeds show a difference in height related to geographical distribution. We investigated the distribution of the 19-bp indel polymorphism in 37 cattle breeds, including 1354 individuals. The results showed that there were three genotypes and two alleles (W, 366 bp; D, 347 bp). From northern cattle to southern cattle, the frequency of W allele gradually decreased, while the frequency of D allele showed an opposite trend, which was consistent with the distribution of cattle breeds of different height in China. Therefore, the polymorphism of this indel may be related to the regional distribution of cattle breeds in China. In addition, we chose Yunling cattle with a mixed genetic background to study the genetic effects of the 19-bp indel on body size traits. Statistical analysis showed that PLAG1 was significantly associated with the body height, cross height, and chest circumference of Yunling cattle (p < 0.05). This study provides new evidence that the 19-bp indel of the PLAG1 gene is a highly effective trait marker that can be used as a candidate molecular marker for cattle breeding. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {The increased demand for chicken meat products has led to chickens with increased growth rates and heavier slaughter weights. This has had unintentional negative effects on the genetics of these animals, such as spontaneous, idiopathic muscle abnormalities. There has also been a shift in customer preference towards products from alternative farming systems such as organic and free-range. Indigenous purebred chickens, such as the Polverara, show potential in these systems as they are adapted to more extensive systems. The aim of the present study was to characterize the meat quality traits of the Polverara, by comparing the proximate composition and amino acid profile with that of a commercial Hybrid. In addition, the lipid and protein oxidation was analyzed after eight days of storage. A total of 120 leg meat samples, 60 Polverara and 60 Hybrid were analyzed. Polverara exhibited higher protein content, lower lipid content, and a better amino acid profile. These results indicate that the Polverara has better nutritional meat quality. However, Polverara also showed higher levels of lipid and protein oxidation. Therefore, further research is needed, especially in regards to the fatty acid profile and mineral content of the meat, which is known to affect oxidative stability. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Enteric methane emissions (EME) of ruminants contribute to global climate change, but any attempt to reduce it will need an easy, inexpensive, and accurate method of quantification. We used a promising indirect method for estimating EMEs of lactating dairy cows based on the analysis of the fatty acid (FA) profile of their milk. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess milk from four single samplings (morning whole, evening whole, evening partially skimmed, and vat milks) as alternatives to reference whole milk samples from two milkings. Three fresh products (cream, cheese, and ricotta), two by-products (whey and scotta), and two long-ripened cheeses (6 and 12 months) were also assessed as alternative sources of information to reference milk. The 11 alternative matrices were obtained from seven experimental cheese-and ricotta-making sessions carried out every two weeks following the artisanal Malga cheese-making procedure using milk from 148 dairy cows kept on summer highland pastures. A total of 131 samples of milk, dairy products, and by-products were analyzed to determine the milk composition and to obtain detailed FA profiles using bi-dimensional gas-chromatography. Two equations taken from a published meta-analysis of methane emissions measured in the respiration chambers of cows on 30 different diets were applied to the proportions of butyric, iso-palmitic, iso-oleic, vaccenic, oleic, and linoleic acids out of total FAs to predict methane yield per kg of dry matter ingested and methane intensity per kg of fat and protein corrected milk produced by the cows. Methane yield and intensity could be predicted from single milk samples with good accuracy (trueness and precision) with respect to those predicted from reference milk. The fresh products (cream, cheese and ricotta) generally showed good levels of trueness but low precision for predicting both EME traits, which means that a greater number of samples needs to be analyzed. Among by-products, whey could be a viable alternative source of information for predicting both EME traits, whereas scotta overestimated both traits and showed low precision (due also to its very low fat content). Long-ripened cheeses were found to be less valuable sources of information, although six-month cheese could, with specific correction factors, be acceptable sources of information for predicting the methane yield of lactating cows. These preliminary results need to be confirmed by further study on different dairy systems and cheese-making technologies but offer new insight into a possible easy method for monitoring the EME at the field level along the dairy chain. © 2019 by the authors.

In Finland, elaphostrongylosis was not recognised as an important disease for Finnish reindeer husbandry, even though the presence of brainworm infection has been documented. Brainworm has an indirect lifecycle with snail and slug intermediate hosts. The free-living L1 larvae have extremely good freeze tolerance and can survive > 360 days at - 80 °C in water (solid ice). Even though reindeer brainworm is clearly well adapted to the Arctic chill, the lifecycle stages outside the reindeer final host are sped up at warmer environmental temperatures. Arctic summer temperatures are close to the developmental threshold of the parasite in the intermediate gastropod hosts (8-10 °C), and the parasite has typically had a 2-year life cycle. Disease outbreaks generally occur during the winter following the infection of reindeer with infected snails and slugs during the summer and autumn. Warmer summers result in faster development of brainworm larvae in the intermediate hosts. Clinical symptoms have been seen reported as early as August, such as in the outbreak in Trøndelag, Norway in 2018. The reindeer brainworm is also a cause of conflict between reindeer herders and small ruminant farmers, because it can cause severe disease in goats and sheep, which share pasture with reindeer. Many knowledge gaps remain if we wish to successfully predict and mitigate for large-scale outbreaks in a future with a predicted warmer, wetter and wilder climate. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Across its pan-European distribution, the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) faces a wide diversity of environmental and climatic conditions; therefore, several factors, including intrinsic ones, shape life-history traits and cause significant variability in parameters of fitness. By utilizing microsatellite variations in 214 roe deer females collected throughout Slovenia, Central Europe, we determined the genetic variability and population structure of this species in the contact zone between the Alps and the Dinaric Mountains, i.e., over a wider area where data on the genetic outlook for this—the most common and widespread European wild ungulate—have been completely lacking so far. Throughout the country, we found moderate microsatellite diversity (Ho = 0.57–0.65) in relation to the observed heterozygosity reported for other roe deer populations in Europe. Spatial differences in genetic diversity of the species in Slovenia can be explained by population history linked to varying approaches to population management and/or different connectivity among subpopulations in topographically differentiated habitats. A country-wide pattern of genetic structure is clearly defined by separation of the populations into three groups present in the following regions: (i) Southern sub-Mediterranean and Karst regions, (ii) Central Slovenia, and (iii) the Sub-Pannonian Region in the north-east. This is also confirmed by evidencing a moderate isolation by distance, especially by separating southern samples (coastal Slovenia) from others. Levels of genetic differentiation vary among populations, which can be explained by the effect of natural geographical barriers or the presence of anthropogenic barriers such as urban areas and highways. In the subset of 172 yearling females, we analyzed the influence of genetic advantage (individual heterozygosity) and other genetic data (reflected in the structuring of the population) on body mass and reproductive ability. We found evidence that genetic factors influence the body mass of roe deer yearling females (explaining altogether 18.8% of body mass variance), and the level of individual heterozygosity alone also positively affected body mass, which is in accordance with the theory that heterozygosity is commonly positively correlated with fitness in wild populations. However, we did not uncover any effect of heterozygosity on two parameters of reproductive ability (fertility and potential reproductive outcome), indicating that several other factors, especially environmental ones, have a predominant effect on the parameters of fitness in roe deer. © 2020 by the authors.

Evolutionary history of crop species, effects of crop domestication and adaptation to different environments on crop population and identification of genes/genomic regions that control important agronomic and adaptive traits were studied. Yield and quality have been primary aims for our breeders, who also strived to anticipate the future needs of the society, developing resilient varieties to environment, pests and diseases by using traditional and biotechnological tools. Innovation in vineyard and orchard management was introduced by developing new strategies or adapting traditional techniques to the needs of social and climate changes. Cultivated landscape preservation was pursued by improving carbon sequestration, increasing soil fertility and reducing the risks of soil erosion and nitrogen leaching. Studies on social support and consumer appreciation of sustainable farming systems marked the importance of matching food safety and security, conservation of biodiversity and improvement of ecosystem services. These last at farm and landscape scale are the framework approach for describing the benefits of crop production to human well-being. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {The horn fly (Haematobia irritans) is particularly unique among the parasites that primarily affect Brazilian cattle farming. Appropriate control strategies fundamentally depend on epidemiological knowledge, which is particularly scarce in Northeastern Brazil. This study aimed to elucidate the ecology of the immature horn fly in the semiarid region of Brazil. Bovine fecal masses were collected and covered with emergence traps to collect the horn fly for sexing and counting. Weather records of the region were concurrently acquired. A total of 11,390H. irritans were collected from 601 fecal masses, with a sex ratio of 0.9:1 (male: female). Horn fly emergence was observed in 78% (15%–100%) of the fecal masses, varying from 1 to 185 (mean = 23.3) flies/fecal mass, predominantly at the beginning of the rainy season. The minimum period for egg-to-adult development of H. irritans varied from 7 to 11 days, indicating the occurrence of 30 generations per year in the region. Rapid development of the immature horn fly in the semiarid region, throughout the year may results in a high number of generations and infestations in cattle herds. © 2020},

	abstract = {• Background Wild crop relatives have been potentially subjected to stresses on an evolutionary time scale prior to domestication. Among these stresses, drought is one of the main factors limiting crop productivity and its impact is likely to increase under current scenarios of global climate change. We sought to determine to what extent wild common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibited adaptation to drought stress, whether this potential adaptation is dependent on the climatic conditions of the location of origin of individual populations, and to what extent domesticated common bean reflects potential drought adaptation. • Methods An extensive and diverse set of wild beans from across Mesoamerica, along with a set of reference Mesoamerican domesticated cultivars, were evaluated for root and shoot traits related to drought adaptation. A water deficit experiment was conducted by growing each genotype in a long transparent tube in greenhouse conditions so that root growth, in addition to shoot growth, could be monitored. • Results Phenotypic and landscape genomic analyses, based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, suggested that beans originating from central and north-west Mexico and Oaxaca, in the driest parts of their distribution, produced more biomass and were deeper-rooted. Nevertheless, deeper rooting was correlated with less root biomass production relative to total biomass. Compared with wild types, domesticated types showed a stronger reduction and delay in growth and development in response to drought stress. Specific genomic regions were associated with root depth, biomass productivity and drought response, some of which showed signals of selection and were previously related to productivity and drought tolerance. • Conclusions The drought tolerance of wild beans consists in its stronger ability, compared with domesticated types, to continue growth in spite of water-limited conditions. This study is the first to relate bean response to drought to environment of origin for a diverse selection of wild beans. It provides information that needs to be corroborated in crosses between wild and domesticated beans to make it applicable to breeding programmes. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {Background: Encephalitozoon cuniculi is an important microsporidian parasite with zoonotic potential. The present study highlights the impact of encephalitozoonosis on rabbit health in Egypt. Three rabbit farms in Giza, with a total of 16,400 rabbits were investigated due to occurrence of rabbits displaying clinical signs consistent with encephalitozoonosis. Results: Clinical signs observed during a 4 months observation period in 2018 included vestibular disease, paresis, limb paralysis, cataracts, phacoclastic uveitis, frequent urination, marked decrease in body weight and in some pregnant females, also repeated abortions. The total morbidity rates in adult and young rabbits were 76.7% and 81.5%, respectively. The highest mortality rate was recorded in offspring (12.3%), followed by dams (5.6%), and the lowest recorded mortality rate was in males (0.04%). Post-mortem findings included enteritis, pale enlarged kidneys, congested leptomeninges, focal brain necrosis, and endometrial congestion. Histopathological examination revealed nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis and glial nodules with central necrosis in the brain, vacuolation and necrosis of renal tubular epithelium, and corneal ulceration and ruptured lens capsule with fragmentation of lenticular fibres. E. cuniculi were observed in the brain, retinal ganglion cells, kidneys, and liver. Transmission electron microscopy examination revealed the presence of different developmental stages of E. cuniculi in the brain and kidney. Presence of E. cuniculi was confirmed by conventional polymerase chain reaction using a universal 16S gene for Encephalitozoon spp. followed by sequencing and sequence analysis. Conclusions: The presence of E. cuniculi in rabbits was confirmed at three farms in Egypt. Nervous signs and ocular lesions were the most predominant findings in these farms. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The goal of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for the growth, conformation, and survival of goat kids raised in smallholder farming systems in Burundi. To do this, measurements were taken on live weight, thoracic perimeter, length, and height at birth (n = 1538 animals), at 3 months (n = 1270 animals), at 6 months (n = 992 animals), at 9 months (n = 787 animals), and at 12 months (n = 705 animals). Kids were born between 2016 and 2019, from 645 dams and 106 bucks. Three bivariate animal models were used to estimate genetic parameters of body weight and conformation measurements as potential indicators of this weight. According to the measure, heritability was estimated between 15 and 17% and genetic correlations between 65 and 79%. An accelerated failure time animal model was used to estimate the heritability of survival for kids under one year, adjusted for birth weight. Goat survival was significantly prolonged by 0.64 days per kilogram of birth weight. The estimated heritability for this trait was 2%. Overall, these results suggest that a selection program could be implemented to improve animal growth, either directly on weight or indirectly on conformational traits. At the same time, efforts need to be made to improve rearing conditions to increase the survival of kids. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: IL-1β is reported to be involved in cancer development and distant metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism of IL-1β upon malignant behaviors remains largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to study whether IL-1β could enhance the stemness traits of tumor cells. Methods: The concentrations of serum IL-1β in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and melanoma patients were detected using ELISA assay. The effect and mechanisms of IL-1β on tumor cell growth, migration, invasion and stemness characters were studied using HNSCC cell SCC7 and melanoma cell B16-F10. The underlying mechanisms were further explored. Results: Enhanced concentrations of IL-1β were positively correlated with advanced tumor stage in both HNSCC and melanoma patients. IL-1β treatment led to a significant increase in tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. IL-1β stimulation promoted cell proliferation, colony formation and tumorigenicity. In addition, IL-1β-stimulated tumor cells gained enhanced capabilities on wounding healing and invasion capabilities. Moreover, IL-1β stimulation promoted the stem-like capabilities of both HNSCC cells and melanoma cells, including the enrichment of aldehyde dehydrogenase+ (ALDH+) cells, up-regulation of stem cell related markers Nanog, OCT4, and SOX2, sphere formation and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, IL-1β treatment promoted the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and activated its downstream target inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1). Silencing ID1 abrogated sphere formation and upregulated expression of stemness genes which were induced by IL-1β stimulation.

	abstract = {Commercial bullfrog farming has increased steadily in Mexico from 1925 to satisfy both the national and international markets. However, intensive production systems are still scarce, and there is a need for information to help further advance their development. Therefore, this study aimed to char-acterize and compare morphometric and physiological traits of bullfrogs bred under intensive culture systems. Three-year-old breeding adults (n = 100) from five farms in three different states, and one-year old juveniles (n = 60) from two of these locations, were used in the study. The scaled mass index (SMI) was calculated by considering body weight and snout-vent length mea-surements. Hematocrit and white blood cell concentrations were determined in juveniles, and a leukocyte profile was established. Eight linear (based on measurements from photographs of the skull), plus one geometric, variables, were used for morphometric analyses. Results show that the SMI did not vary between localities or gender in juvenile frogs, while differences were found both between sexes (p < 0.026) and between farms (p < 0.001) in adult frogs. Hematocrit and neutrophil concentrations in juvenile individuals also differed between localities. Linear and geometric morphometric analyses in juvenile frogs showed differences between sexes (p < 0.001) and between localities (p < 0.001), the latter suggesting the existence of at least two morphotypes of this species. This study presents relevant information to help advance bullfrog farming in Mexico. © 2020 Braulio Ayala García et al.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive study was carried out in Gramapriya female line (PD-3) with respect to growth, production, selection response and population structure utilizing the data generated for the last seven generations at ICARDirectorate of Poultry Research, Hyderabad, Telangana. The average fertility was 71.89% and hatchability was 80.52% on fertile egg set and 57.08% on total egg set. The least squares means (LSMs) for body weight at 4 and 6 weeks of age were 168.06±0.01 and 320.10±0.02 g, respectively. The heritability estimates from sire and dam components of variance were moderate to high for both body weights and shank length (0.27 to 0.35). The correlation coefficients (genetic and phenotypic) between body weights and shank length were positive and high in magnitude except with day old body weight. Age at sexual maturity (ASM) was 171.47±0.01 days in PD-3 population. The part period egg production (EP 40) at 40 weeks of age was 75.60±0.01 eggs with an egg mass (EM 40) of 4,157.19±0.99 g. The h2 estimates for ASM, EW 40, EP 40 and EM 40 were 0.16±0.07, 0.42±0.11, 0.18±0.07 and 0.15±0.06, respectively, which were moderate to high in magnitude. The egg production at 40 weeks of age was negatively associated with ASM, body weights and egg weights at different ages. Egg mass had significant (P£0.05) positive association with egg production and egg weight at 40 weeks of age. The selection intensity (i) and ranged from 0.32 to 0.85 while, rate of inbreeding ranged between 0.0031 and 0.0033 in PD-3 line. The direct selection response was 151.54 g on genetic scale and 79.75 (P<0.05) on phenotypic scale for primary trait of selection, EM 40 over the last seven generations. Realized and estimated heritability estimates were 0.29 and 0.15, respectively for EM 40. The study concluded that, PD-3 population was in ideal condition with respect to growth and production performance. Positive selection response for primary trait EM 40 was observed in the population maintaining both egg production and egg weight the important traits for sustainable rural poultry farming. © 2020 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

	abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a cyclo-zoonotic disease endemic to Pakistan, however, phylogeography and etiology of Echinococcus granulosus from human host has remained unexplored so far. The current study was carried out to estimate population structure and appraise the genetic variability of E. granulosus in two major provinces of Pakistan, Sindh and Punjab. 94 isolates were subjected to sequence analysis from histopathologically confirmed CE patients using a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1; 366bp). Three genotypes of E. granulosus sensu lato, G1 (57.44%), G3 (41.48%) and G6 (1.06%), were inferred to exist in human patients. Molecular diversity indices for E. granulosus sensu stricto manifested the presence of 14 haplotypes among the regional populations forming distinct clades with sheep (G1) and buffalo (G3) strains. The haplotype network displayed a double clustered star like feature with PK-H1c (37.63%) and PK-H9c (32.25%) as most dominant haplotypes displaying low genetic differentiation between the two geographic regions. Neutrality indices (Tajima's D and Fu's Fs) were negative for all populations indicating population expansion across Pakistan. The sympatric presence of G1 and G3 genotypes among humans in endemic focus of Pakistan confirms the zoonotic potential of E. granulosus s.s. with special emphasis on the G3 strain which emerged as a dominant cause of CE in humans compared to other global studies, where only G1 is linked to the majority of CE cases. Data from this study will prove to be a keystone for devising robust regional control strategies for human hydatidosis and investigating potential pathogenicity of E. granulosus s.l. haplotypes and their clinical manifestations in Pakistan. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Ramo Grande is a local cattle breed raised in the archipelago of Azores, with a small and dispersed census, where inbreeding control is of utmost importance. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Beadchip array was used to assess inbreeding, by analysis of genomic regions harboring contiguous homozygous genotypes named runs of homozygosity (ROH), and to estimate past effective population size by analysis of linkage disequilibrium (LD). Genetic markers associated with production traits were also investigated, exploiting the unique genetic and adaptation features of this breed. A total of 639 ROH with length >4 Mb were identified, with mean length of 14.96 Mb. The mean genomic inbreeding was 0.09, and long segments of ROH were common, indicating recent inbred matings. The LD pattern indicates a large effective population size, suggesting the inflow of exotic germplasm in the past. The genome-wide association study identified novel markers significantly affecting longevity, age at first calving and direct genetic effects on calf weight. These results provide the first evidence of the association of longevity with genes related with DNA recognition and repair, and the association of age at first calving with aquaporin proteins, which are known to have a crucial role in reproduction. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is a critically endangered species, whose recruitment stocks have declined to nearly 1% compared to the late 70s. An amalgam of factors is responsible for this, among them migration barriers, pollution, habitat loss, parasite infection, and overfishing. A lot of recent studies focus on aspects that can increase the mature silver eel escapement rate, such as identifying migration barriers and developing passageways or addressing the impact of pollution on the eel’s health. However, little attention is given to the eel’s morphology in function of management measures. Worryingly, less than 50% of the currently installed management plans reach their goals, strongly indicating that more information is needed about the eel’s ecology and behavior. Functional morphological studies provide insights on how species perform behaviors crucial for survival, such as feeding and locomotion, but also in how environmental changes can affect or limit such behaviors. Consequently, functional morphology represents an important biotic component that should be taken into account when making conservation decisions. Hence, here, we provide an overview of studies on the eel’s morphology that do not only demonstrate its relation with ecology and behavior, but also provide information for developing and installing proper and more specific management measures. © The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of the Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitor ouabain in regulating osteosarcoma (OS) cell stemness. Material/Methods: Western blot, qPCR, sphere-forming analysis, DNA methylation analysis, and Ca2+ concentration detection were performed to evaluate the stem-like traits of cells and ouabain-induced effects and related mechanisms on OS cell stemness. Cell viability assessment was performed to evaluate the effect of ouabain on OS cell chemosensitivity. Results: Ouabain reduced the ALDH1 activity, the expression of critical stemness regulators, sphere size and number, and migration, invasion, and adhesion ability, but had little effects on cell viability. Additionally, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and methylation level of the critical stemness regulators were higher in OS cells than in spheres formed by OS cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that ouabain leads to DNA methylation of stemness markers through increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Notably, inhibition of Ca2+ channel or DNA methylation rescued the inhibition of ouabain on OS cell stemness. Additionally, ouabain enhances cisplatin sensitivity of OS cells, which is involved in Ca2+ channel and DNA methylation. Conclusions: This work provides a potential compound for treating OS patients, especially OS patients with chemoresistance. © Med Sci Monit, 2019.},

Body weights and shank lengths significantly (P≤0.05) differed at all ages. Aseel crosses with coloured broiler lines (PB-1 and PB-2) had significantly (P≤0.05) higher body weights while Aseel x PD-1 cross recorded higher shank length at all ages. The fat and ash proportion varied significantly (P≤0.05) among the crosses. The pH values of the breast meat ranged 5.89 to 6.29. The Shear force values (SFV) and Hydroxyproline (HP) concentration differed significantly (P≤0.05) among the crosses. Meat colour differed significantly (P≤0.05) with respect to yellowness (b*) and red (a*) colouration. The proportion of legs, wings, back, neck, meat and bone significantly (P≤0.05) differed among the crosses. The cluster analysis of means of all traits revealed that least distance exists between Aseel x PD-1 and Aseel x PD-6.

	abstract = {Haemaphysalis longicornis (Acari: Ixodidae), the Asian longhorned tick, is native to East Asia, but has become established in Australia and New Zealand, and more recently in the United States. In North America, there are other native Haemaphysalis species that share similar morphological characteristics and can be difficult to identify if the specimen is damaged. The goal of this study was to develop a cost-effective and rapid molecular diagnostic assay to differentiate between exotic and native Haemaphysalis species to aid in ongoing surveillance of H. longicornis within the United States and help prevent misidentification. We demonstrated that restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) can be used to differentiate H. longicornis from the other Haemaphysalis species found in North America. Furthermore, we show that this RFLP assay can be applied to Haemaphysalis species endemic to other regions of the world for the rapid identification of damaged specimens. The work presented in this study can serve as the foundation for region specific PCR-RFLP keys for Haemaphysalis and other tick species and can be further applied to other morphometrically challenging taxa. © Copyright © 2020 Thompson, Dominguez, Cleveland, Doi, Falco, Greay, Irwin, Liu, Mather, Oskam, Rodriguez-Vivas, Ruder, Shaw, Vigil, White, Yabsley, and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada (for Dergousoff and Lindsay).},

	abstract = {Gene stacking refers to the introduction of two or more transgenes of agronomic interest in the same plant. The main methods for genetically engineering plants with gene stacking involve (i) the simultaneous introduction, by the co-transformation process, and (ii) the sequential introduction of genes using the re-transformation processes or the sexual crossing between separate transgenic events. In general, the choice of the best method varies according to the species of interest and the availability of genetic constructions and preexisting transgenic events. We also present here the use of minichromosome technology as a potential future gene stacking technology. The purpose of this review was to discuss aspects related to the methodology for gene stacking and trait stacking (a gene stacking strategy to combine characteristics of agronomical importance) by genetic engineering. In addition, we presented a list of crops and genes approved commercially that have been used in stacking strategies for combined characteristics and a discussion about the regulatory standards. An increased number of approved and released gene stacking events reached the market in the last decade. Initially, the most common combined characteristics were herbicide tolerance and insect resistance in soybean and maize. Recently, commercially available varieties were released combining these traits with drought tolerance in these commodities. New traits combinations are reaching the farmer S fields, including higher quality, disease resistant and nutritional value improved. In other words, gene stacking is growing as a strategy to contribute to food safety and sustainability. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Climate change is a major global threat to the sustainability of livestock systems. Climatic factors such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, direct and indirect solar radiation and wind speed influence feed and water availability, fodder quality and disease occurrence, with production being most efficient in optimal environmental conditions. Among these climatic variables, ambient temperature fluctuations have the most impact on livestock production and animal welfare. Continuous exposure of the animals to heat stress compromises growth, milk and meat production and reproduction. The capacity of an animal to mitigate effects of increased environmental temperature, without progressing into stress response, differs within and between species. Comparatively, small ruminants are better adapted to hot environments than large ruminants and have better ability to survive, produce and reproduce in harsh climatic regions. Nevertheless, the physiological and behavioral changes in response to hot environments affect small ruminant production. It has been found that tropical breeds are more adaptive to hot climates than high-producing temperate breeds. The growing body of knowledge on the negative impact of heat stress on small ruminant production and welfare will assist in the development of suitable strategies to mitigate heat stress. Selection of thermotolerant breeds, through identification of genetic traits for adaption to extreme environmental conditions (high temperature, feed scarcity, water scarcity), is a viable strategy to combat climate change and minimize the impact on small ruminant production and welfare. This review highlights such adaption within and among different breeds of small ruminants challenged by heat stress. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The field of neurocriminology has proposed several treatments (e.g., pharmacological, brain surgery, androgen-deprivation therapy, neurofeedback) to reduce violence proneness, but unfortunately, their effectiveness has been limited due to their side-effects. Therefore, it is necessary to explore alternative techniques to improve patients’ behavioural regulation with minimal undesirable effects. In this regard, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, which are based on applying changing magnetic fields or electric currents to interfere with cortical excitability, have revealed their usefulness in alleviating the symptomatology of several mental disorders. However, to our knowledge, there are no reviews that assess whether these techniques are useful for reducing violence proneness. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria using the following databases: PsycINFO, PubMed, Dialnet, Psicodoc, Web of Knowledge, and the Cochrane Library. We initially identified 3746 entries, and eventually included 56 publications. Most of the studies were unanimous in concluding that the application of these techniques over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was not sufficient to promote anger and irritability reductions in euthymic individuals of both genders. Nevertheless, the application of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, especially transcranial direct current stimulation, over the right PFC seemed to reduce violent reactions in these individuals by interfering with the interpretation of the unfavourable situations (e.g., threating signals) or inner states that evoked anger. In antisocial and pathological populations, the conclusions were provided by a few pilot studies with important methodological weaknesses. The main conclusion of these studies was that bilateral stimulation of the PFC satisfactorily reduced anger and irritability only in inmates, patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), people who suffered a closed-head injury, and agitated patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, combining these techniques with risperidone considerably reduced aggressiveness in these patients. Therefore, it is necessary to be cautious about the benefits of these techniques to control anger, due the methodological weaknesses of these studies. Nonetheless, they offer valuable opportunities to prevent violence by designing new treatments combining brain stimulation with current strategies, such as psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, in order to promote lasting changes. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {In a greenhouse experiment, the inoculated and uninoculated grains with Azospirillum brasilense NO40 or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were sown in unsterilized sandy soil and watered normally till the 8th day. Thereafter, the drought stress was initiated by watering pots once every 10 days while the unstressed pots were irrigated normally once every 5 days. Samples of spikes and dry grains were collected after 120 days from sowing. The results indicated that the inoculated-drought-stressed plants maintained significantly higher values of all of the measured yield parameters, where the yielded grains had higher amounts of the direct reducing sugars, sucrose, starch; lower contents of total soluble proteins and the total free amino acids, and altered protein patterns compared to those of the uninoculated-drought-stressed plants. SDS-PAGE of the yielded grains showed that drought led to the appearance of some newly synthesized stress protein bands and disappearance of others. Inoculation with PGPB resulted in the re-appearance of some of the disappearing bands and the synthesis of new others. Meanwhile, wheat inoculation under normal conditions resulted in significantly promoted grain yields with higher contents of carbohydrates, total soluble proteins and total free amino acids than that of the uninoculated control. It has been proved that treating wheat plants with the PEG-tolerant Azospirillum brasilense NO40 or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia that were compatible with the systems into which they were introduced and possess multiple plant growth promoting traits, can be an efficient strategy to enhance wheat growth and productivity, not only under normal conditions, but also under drought stress. © Articles by the authors;SHST,Cluj-Napoca,Romania.

	abstract = {For the sustainable production of fuel, biomass pyrolysis processes have appeared as a promising alternative for the efficient utilization of biomass. The liquid product obtained from biomass pyrolysis, i.e., bio-oil has a very complex composition including large proportion of organic oxygenated hydrocarbon compounds and appreciable amount of water. The high oxygen content of the bio-oil creates many major drawbacks that hinder its vast application. The quality of bio-oil is not applicable for direct transportation purposes, and its upgrading is mandatory before it can be used practically in power engines. The abovementioned drawbacks can be overcome by the catalytic hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil, in which the functional groups containing oxygen are removed and replaced by hydrogen atoms. For this purpose of selectively activating and breaking the C-O bonds while trying to maintain the C-C bonds intact, processing knowledge base of petroleum industry may not be utilized for hydrodeoxygenation of bio-oil. Therefore, novel catalysts, solvents, and processes need to be developed. This chapter reviews the state-of-the-art results obtained from the research and development of these technologies. The pros and cons, potential of future applications, challenges related to these technologies, and opportunities to maximize economic and environmental benefits while minimizing pollution are highlighted. Besides, the application of molecular modeling in the integration with experiment is highlighted in this chapter as a new paradigm for mechanistic studies, which could open new avenues to design and develop catalysts for a plethora of bio-oil upgrading processes that require high activity and selectivity. Finally, the breakthrough applications of novel sonochemical technique in biomass treatment and conversion are introduced in this chapter. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

	abstract = {There are 8 million people with Chagas disease worldwide and in El Salvador approximately 39% of the population is at risk of contracting the disease. One of the principal challenges in mitigating Chagas is evaluating the role of the vector ecology of triatomine species in the transmission of the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite in anthropogenically modified habitats, where new patterns of transmission frequently arise. Field studies of triatomine vector ecology in El Salvador have largely focused on describing parameters that contribute to infestation patterns, which may themselves be rooted in the morphological variability that exists in triatomine populations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the morphology of the vector species Triatoma dimidiata with respect to the characteristics of the ecological landscape the vector inhabits throughout El Salvador. We used image analyses to evaluate T. dimidiata morphological variability and then used Geographic Information Systems to intersect the morphological point-data with map layers containing different environmental characteristics. Our study found that the variation in the size, shape, and coloration of T. dimidiata varied in relation to elevation, Holdridge life zone, soil type and land use. We further characterize the local morphological adaptations of T. dimidiata with respect to the local ecological, biological, and geographical conditions in El Salvador. We suggest that future studies consider a molecular exploration of local T. dimidiata species complex in El Salvador, especially since morphological studies of triatomine species complex have found that variability correlate with the genetic variability of the population. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic change has well-documented impacts on stress physiology and behavior across diverse taxonomic groups. Within individual organisms, physiological and behavioral traits often covary at proximate and ultimate timescales. In the context of global change, this means that impacts on physiology can have downstream impacts on behavior, and vice versa. Because all organisms interact with members of their own species and other species within their communities, the effects of humans on one organism can impose indirect effects on one or more other organisms, resulting in cascading effects across interaction networks. Human-induced changes in the stress physiology of one species and the downstream impacts on behavior can therefore interact with the physiological and behavioral responses of other organisms to alter emergent ecological phenomena. Here, we highlight three scenarios in which the stress physiology and behavior of individuals on different sides of an ecological relationship are interactively impacted by anthropogenic change. We discuss host-parasite/pathogen dynamics, predator-prey relationships, and beneficial partnerships (mutualisms and cooperation) in this framework, considering cases in which the effect of stressors on each type of network may be attenuated or enhanced by interactive changes in behavior and physiology. These examples shed light on the ways that stressors imposed at the level of one individual can impact ecological relationships to trigger downstream consequences for behavioral and ecological dynamics. Ultimately, changes in stress physiology on one or both sides of an ecological interaction can mediate higher-level population and community changes due in part to their cascading impacts on behavior.

	abstract = {Eating disorder (ED) patients show alarmingly high prevalence rates of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI). Adolescents seem to be particularly at risk, as EDs and NSSI both have their onset in mid-adolescence. It has been suggested that personality could be a transdiagnostic mechanism underlying both EDs and NSSI. However, little attention has been given to adolescent clinical samples compared to adult and/or community samples. Therefore, the current study investigated the role of personality in a sample of 189 female inpatients with an ED (M = 15.93, SD = 0.98). Our results confirmed the high prevalence of NSSI in EDs, specifically in patients with bingeing/purging behaviours (ED-BP). Temperamental differences were found between ED-BP and the restrictive ED subtype (ED-R). Namely, ED-BP patients showed more harm avoidance and less self-directedness compared to ED-R. Temperamental differences were found in NSSI as well, regardless of ED subtype: ED patients who had engaged in NSSI during their lifetime reported less self-directedness and more harm avoidance. Interestingly, only ED patients who recently engaged in NSSI showed less novelty seeking. These temperamental profiles should be recognised as key mechanisms in the treatment of adolescent ED patients with and without NSSI. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Accelerants and fabrics are commonly used to spread fire attributable to their highly flammable properties. Hence, having the ability to discriminate the different types of accelerants on various types of fabrics after fire and/or arson using the non-destructive Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometric techniques appears forensically relevant. Methods: Six types of fabrics viz. cotton, wool, silk, rayon, satin, and polyester, were burnt completely with RON95 and RON97 gasoline as well as diesel. Subsequently, the samples were analyzed by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for discriminating the different types of accelerants on such burned fabrics. Results: RON95 showed the fastest rate of burning on all fabric types. Results also revealed that while wool had the slowest burning rate for all the three different accelerants, polyester, cotton, and satin demonstrated the highest rate of burning in RON95, RON97, and diesel, respectively. FTIR spectra revealed the presence of alkane, alcohol, alkene, alkyne, aromatic, and amine compounds for all fabrics. The two dimensional PCA (PC1 versus PC2) demonstrated 71% of variance and it was improved by cross-validation through the three dimensional LDA technique with correct classification of 77.8%. Conclusion: ATR-FTIR spectroscopy coupled with chemometric techniques had enabled identification of the functional groups, as well as statistically supported discrimination of the different accelerants, a matter of relevance in forensic fire and arson investigations. © 2020 UPM Press.

	abstract = {Kerteszia is a neotropical subgenus of Anopheles composed of 12 species. The species in this subgenus are strongly associated with humid forests rich in epiphytic bromeliads. Forest fragmentation and anthropogenic changes can therefore have a negative impact on the abundance and survival of these mosquito species. Within this subgenus, four species are considered primary vectors of malaria: An. cruzii, An. bellator, An. homunculus and An. neivai. Malaria cases associated with Kerteszia species are often referred to as bromeliad malaria, a type of malaria reported to be endemic in the coastal rainforest of the neotropical region since the end of the nineteenth century. Although the incidence of bromeliad-malaria cases has decreased since the middle of the last century, autochthonous malaria cases continue to be registered every year. The complexity of the epidemiology of bromeliad malaria appears to be increasing as asymptomatic plasmodial infections and transmission of simian Plasmodium to humans have recently been reported. Kerteszia vector species have a great affinity for human beings and can be found in human-modified areas close to forest fragments such as in the Extra-Amazonian region of Brazil, Colombian pacific coast, and the Caribbean coast. Deforestation and forest fragmentation have been occurring continuously in the biomes of the neotropical region, and findings of Kerteszia species in dwellings are frequent in this region. Controlling the species in the Kerteszia subgenus is particularly difficult because they move frequently from natural to rural and peri-urban areas in search of blood sources, posing a challenge for the development of control strategies based on integrated vector management. Furthermore, as it has been shown that some Kerteszia species share similar morphological and genetic characteristics, the existence of a species complex formed by cryptic, sibling species within the Kerteszia group in different areas in the South and Southeast of Brazil cannot be ruled out. The existence of such a complex could represent an obstacle to the control of Kerteszia species and consequently to the elimination of bromeliad-malaria transmission in these regions. Here, we review publications that focus on the biology and ecology of Kerteszia malaria vectors and their association with human-modified areas and bromeliad-malaria transmission. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third generation cephalosporins (ER3GC) constitute a major health issue for humans and animals in the Indian Ocean. Rats are synanthropic reservoirs. We have used rats as environmental bioindicators of the occurrence of ER3GC. The main objective of this exploratory study was to generate hypotheses on environmental contamination by ER3GC in the two French territories of the Indian Ocean. This objective was addressed by i) estimating the prevalence of ER3GC and of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacteria (ESBL-E) in rats from the two territories in 2013-2014, and ii) identifying the determinants of this carriage in rats (life history traits and land use). In 2013-2014, rats were sampled according to an altitudinal gradient in Reunion and Mayotte on several sites with low anthropization. From a convenience sample of 198 and 138 rats in Reunion and Mayotte, respectively, the prevalence of ER3GC was 5.1% and 8.7%, and the prevalence of ESBL-E was 0.5% and 0.8%. The mass, tail length, and proportion of agricultural land in the home range of the rat were determinants of ER3GC carriage in Reunion. In Mayotte, the determinants of this carriage were a low mass and the capture site of the rat with a cluster of positive cases at a specific location. Finally, the results obtained seem to indicate a low environmental contamination by ER3GC in Reunion and Mayotte in 2013-2014. In Reunion, the hypothesis of environmental contamination by slurry spraying was raised, requiring further investigations. © 2019, CIRAD. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is the key component of health care in China for the past 5,000 years. It has extensively influenced the healthcare industry not only in China but also in neighboring countries. The use of CHM to treat human diseases, especially cancer, is keep growing. Furthermore, millions of money were invested to study the role of CHM in cancer cure. In the last decade, researchers together with CHM practitioners tried to bridge the gap to understand each other's perspective to find the effectiveness of CHM in treating cancer. The mechanism of CHM in treating cancer is best understood via the theory of cancer hallmark proposed by Hanahan and Weinberg, which describes functional, molecular, and biological traits of specific cancer. The eight hallmarks of cancer are inhibiting proliferative signaling, inducing growth suppressors, inducing cell death, inhibiting replicative immortality, antiangiogenesis, inhibition of invasion and metastasis, energy metabolism, and immune destructive. The information is extracted from electronic resources (PubMed, Wiley, Springer, and ScienceDirect). This article reviews the antitumor activity of CHM against various cancers through each of the eight cancer hallmarks. It is hoped that this article would provide essential knowledge in cancer treatment by CHM. © 2020 Subramaniam and Lim.},

	abstract = {Responses of drought tolerant (DT) and drought susceptible (DS) Ethiopian groundnut varieties to terminal drought stress were compared to determine the traits behind drought tolerance. Drought (D) induced from 91 to 105 days after sowing (DAS) reduced leaf RWC (relative water content, %), leaf area (cm2 plant-1), Chl (chlorophyll, mg g-1 fresh weight), RDM (root dry mass, g plant-1), ADM (aboveground dry mass, g plant-1), TDM (total dry mass, g plant-1) and plant height (cm); however, D increased SLM (specific leaf mass, g m-2). High leaf RWC in DS types reinstated the hypothesis that capacity to save leaf water is not a method of drought tolerance. Although there were insignificant Chl differences between DT and DS types, dry matter accumulation (RDM and ADM) was higher in DT types, which is attributed to higher SLM in DT types. SLM had significant positive relationship with RDM. An increase in plant height without increase in leaf area explains drought susceptibility in DS types. Resumption of irrigation on 106 DAS resulted in an increase in leaf RWC; however, this accompanied no resurrection response in terms of studied physiological and growth parameters and thus, it was not possible to restore pod yield after D impaired groundnut growth. Certain parameters were higher in DT types, positively correlated with DRI (drought response index) and primarily decided by the genotype; such parameters were concluded to be the traits behind drought tolerance. © 2020, Editorial board of Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences.

Most traits revealed the highest coefficients of variation (CV). Results showed that the maximum phenotypic variance (PCV) of traits were generally higher than genotypic coefficients of variance (GCV) under both conditions. Obtained heritability accompanied with high genetic advance for several traits indicates that most likely the heritability is due to additive gene effects and selection may be effective in early generations for these traits. These parameters were estimated for a number of traits in vitro cultures as well. Mean comparisons demonstrated that the lines G6 and G9 achieved higher levels of callus size and relative water content under the both optimal and stress conditions, while maintaining this ability in stress condition compared to other lines. Moreover, the lines G4 and G16 had the minimum difference between fresh and dry weights in optimal and stress conditions. So, these lines had the higher genetic potential for response to drought stress in vitro environments. © 2020, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Reproductive performance is one of the most important economic traits in beef or dairy production. The majority (60%) of Somalis are pastoral nomads and engage livestock production for livelihood, employment and income. Recurrent droughts and diseases are discouraging the pastoral production systems and forcing some pastoralists and diaspora to adopt small scale dairy production. Measuring the reproductive efficiency of dairy production in Somalia is paramount and deemed necessary. Therefore, an assessment was launched to assess factors that affect reproductive performance and understand the breeding regularity of local cattle breeds in Benadir region. This study was cross sectional and took place from Feb. 2018 to Feb. 2019. The study used both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. A total of 100 respondents were interviewed to collect qualitative data while a total of 2916 cattle were examined to gather quantitative data. The overall estimated means for age at puberty (AP), age at first calving (AFC) and calving interval (CI) was: 37.9 months, 49.2 months, and 19.15 months respectively. The percentage of cows weaned live calf was 57.6%. The average milk yield of local breeds is estimated to be 8 liters per day with average lactation period of 7.7 months. In calves, the average birth weight, weaning weight, maturity weight was 15.22 kg, 156.3 kg, and 310.28 kg respectively. The fertility rate was also measured and it was found that the average conception rate to be 18%, a general fertility of 53.85%, a dystocia rate of 5.6%. Heredity, nutritional stress and diseases appeared to be the main problems causing low reproductive efficiency in the study area. Other challenges in cattle production in the area were low inputs and poor facilities. Therefore, it is recommendable that short trainings and appropriate technology transfer in delivering animal husbandry practice and basic veterinary services to small holder farmers in Benadir region. © 2020 Hassan et al.

	abstract = {This study was performed to compare the di erences in pH, myofibril fragmentation index (MFI), total protein solubility (TPS), sarcoplasmic protein solubility (SPS), myofibrillar protein solubility (MPS), and the microstructure of seven beef muscles during aging. Fromthe six beef carcasses of Xinjiang brown cattle, a total of 252 samples from semitendinosus (ST), longissimus thoracis (LT), rhomboideus (RH), gastrocnemius (GN), infraspinatus (IN), psoas major (PM), and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were collected, portioned, and assigned to six aging periods (1, 3, 7, 9, 11, and 14 day/s) and 42 samples were used per storage period. IN muscle showed the highest pH (p < 0.05) from 1 to 14 days and the lowest TPS (p < 0.01) from 9 to 14 days with respect to the other muscles. Moreover, the changes in IN were further supported by transmission electron microscopy due to the destruction of the myofibril structure. The highest value of MFI was tested in ST muscle from 7 to 14 days. The total protein solubility in PM, RH, and GN muscles were not affected (p >0.05) as the aging period increased. The lowest TPS was found in the RH muscle on day 1, 3, and 7 and in the IN muscle on day 9, 11, and 14. The pH showed negative correlations with the MFI, TPS, and MPS (p < 0.01). The results suggest that changes in protein solubility and muscle fiber structure are related to muscle location in the carcass during aging. These results provide new insights to optimize the processing and storage of different beef muscles and enhance our understanding of the biological characteristics of Xinjiang brown cattle muscles. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Understanding characteristics of production systems and identification of specific preferred traits related to breeding objectives is a first important step to the successful implementation of any breeding program. This study was conducted in the South West of Burkina Faso, the traditional habitat of trypanotolerant Baoulé cattle, to identify farmers’ trait preferences and breeding practices. Following a synthesis of information from stakeholders, a structural questionnaire was designed and administered to 194 heads of households. Cattle herd structure was investigated via herd survey on 101 farms to record breed, age, status, weight and linear body measurements of animals. Own herd ranking method was used in addition to identify the most important criteria for selecting breeding cows. The importance of each criterion was estimated by computing the index of ranking. Regarding breeds and herd mobility, sedentary pure Baoulé, sedentary mixed breed, and transhumant Zebu and crossbred systems were defined. Average cattle herd size was 51.23±55.72 heads and was significantly (P˂0.05) highest in the transhumant Zebu and crossbred system. Herd structure showed that cows were the most frequent age-sex-class in all the production systems. A high proportion of all farmers reported purposefully selecting their breeding animals but only 36.67% of them in pure Baoulé system select their breeding females. Breeding bulls were selected from young males in the own herd and they were selected significantly (P˂0.05) later in pure Baoulé system. The majority of transhumant farmers reported castration of not selected males while only 33% of farmers in pure Baoulé system reported that. The most important common criteria for selection among the production systems were adult size for both males and females, including calf growth for females. Production systems were heterogeneous on the other preferred traits. Based on these findings, implementation of breeding programs involving farmers and their specific characteristics and practices can contribute to improve and conserve local cattle breeds in this area. Community-based breeding programs for pure Baoulé and crossbreds aiming to improve body size and trypanotolerance are being implemented. © 2019},

	abstract = {Mutton and lamb sales continue to grow globally at a rate of 5% per year. However, sheep farming struggles with low profit margins due to high feed costs and modest carcass yields. Selecting those sheep expected to convert feed efficiently and have high carcass merit, as early as possible in their life cycle, could significantly improve the profitability of sheep farming. Unfortunately, direct measurement of feed conversion efficiency (via residual feed intake [RFI]) and carcass merit is a laborintensive and expensive procedure. Thus, indirect, marker-assisted evaluation of these traits has been explored as a means of reducing the cost of its direct measurement. One promising and potentially inexpensive route to discover biomarkers of RFI and/or carcass merit is metabolomics. Using quantitative metabolomics, we profiled the blood serum metabolome (i.e., the sum of all measurable metabolites) associated with sheep RFI and carcass merit and identified candidate biomarkers of these traits. The study included 165 crossbred ram-lambs that underwent direct measurement of feed consumption to determine their RFI classification (i.e., low vs. high) using the GrowSafe System over a period 40 d. Carcass merit was evaluated after slaughter using standardized methods. Prior to being sent to slaughter, one blood sample was drawn from each animal, and serum prepared and frozen at -80 °C to limit metabolite degradation. A subset of the serum samples was selected based on divergent RFI and carcass quality for further metabolomic analyses. The analyses were conducted using three analytical methods (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and inductively coupled mass spectrometry), which permitted the identification and quantification of 161 unique metabolites. Biomarker analyses identified three significant (P < 0.05) candidate biomarkers of sheep RFI (AUC = 0.80), seven candidate biomarkers of carcass yield grade (AUC = 0.77), and one candidate biomarker of carcass muscle-to-bone ratio (AUC = 0.74). The identified biomarkers appear to have roles in regulating energy metabolism and protein synthesis. These results suggest that serum metabolites could be used to categorize and predict sheep for their RFI and carcass merit. Further validation using a larger (3×) and more diverse cohort of sheep is required to confirm these findings.  © The Author(s) 2020.},

	abstract = {Hanwoo is one of the most economically important animal species in Korea due to its significant contribution to nutrition. However, the current selection index only focuses to improve carcass traits of Hanwoo. Thus, this study aimed to estimate the genetic parameters of birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WW) and their genetic and phenotypic relationship to the age at first calving (AFC) and gestation length (GL) of Hanwoo. The genetic parameters for birth weight (BW) and weaning weight (WW) were estimated using the data obtained from 52,173 and 35,800 Hanwoo calves born from February 1998 to March 2017, respectively. Further, these data were used to determine their genetic and phenotypic correlation to age at first calving (AFC) and gestation length (GL). The heritability estimates of BW and WW and correlation coefficients were obtained using the average information restricted maximum likelihood (AIREML) procedure, fit in single and two-trait linear animal models. The estimated direct heritability for BW and WW was moderate (0.22 ± 0.02) and high (0.51 ± 0.03), respectively, while the maternal heritability for both traits was 0.12 ± 0.01 and 0.17 ± 0.01, respectively. The genetic correlation of BW and reproductive traits (AFC and GL) showed a moderate and high positive correlation coefficient of 0.33 ± 0.06 and 0.53 ± 0.02, respectively, while close to zero and low positive phenotypic correlations of 0.06 ± 0.01 and 0.21 ± 0.06 were also observed between the correlated traits, respectively. For the correlation analysis between WW and AFC, both the genetic and phenotypic correlation showed close to zero values of 0.04 ± 0.06 and −0.01 ± 0.01, respectively. Meanwhile, the genetic and phenotypic correlation between WW and GL showed low and negative correlations of −0.09 ± 0.06 and −0.09 ± 0.01, respectively. These obtained estimated variances for BW and WW and their corresponding genetic and phenotypic correlation to AFC and GL can be used as information for genetic improvement and subsequent economic improvement of Hanwoo farming. © 2020 by the authors.

Female and male genital traits were evaluated throughout the reproductive cycle, including the ovary, uterus, testicle, epididymis, seminiferous tubule morphometry, and germinative epithelium histology. Moreover, individual female fecundity was determined by counting uterine scars. Ovary width and uterus weight, length, and width reached their highest values in the luteal and pregnancy phases. On conducting a histological evaluation of the testicular germinal epithelium, four morphotypes related to the different reproductive phases of the male squirrels were identified: immature, pubertal, spermatogenesis, and regressive. Testicle and epididymis weights and seminiferous tubule diameters reached their largest values during spermatogenesis. Uterine scar analysis showed that 69% of the females had given birth to one or two litters, while 31% had no uterine scars. Litters were larger in the first breeding period than in the second; annual fecundity was 4.52 ± 1.88 uterine scars/female.

	abstract = {The phenotypic variation in populations is the result of genetic variation and two nongenetic sources of variation, namely, environmentally induced variation (EIV) and stochastic developmental variation (SDV). EIV (phenotypic plasticity sensu stricto) and SDV (developmental noise) occur in all kingdoms of life and are thus considered general biological principles. They have in common that they are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms but they differ in quality and function. EIV is directional and contributes to phenotype optimization in the inhabited environment, whereas SDV is random and contributes to evolutionary bet-hedging. This chapter discusses the differences and relationships between EIV and SDV on a theoretical and empirical basis and presents examples on their extent in animals, the most complex organisms on earth. In the laboratory, EIV and SDV were determined by exposing genetically identical populations to either different or single environments. The rare studies on the determination of EIV and SDV in natural populations exploited clonal lineages adapted to different environments. Computer simulation of phenotypes produced by reaction-diffusion mechanisms has also proven useful for determining the extent of SDV. The available data indicate that a surprisingly high proportion of phenotypic variation is caused by nongenetic sources. The relative contribution of EIV and SDV to phenotypic variation depends on species, trait, and environment and is apparently subject to evolutionary change. There is increasing evidence that alterations of the methylation marks on the DNA and acetylation and methylation marks on the histones are among the molecular mechanisms that produce different phenotypes from the same genome, either stochastically or by environmental induction. The monoclonal marbled crayfish, which in recent times has adapted to diverse freshwater habitats on three continents despite genetic identity, is introduced as a promising model to investigate the extent and molecular underpinning of EIV and SDV and their ecological and evolutionary relevance in depth. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Investigating traditional knowledge is a science of preserving age-old practices, and now new drugs and nutraceutical products are formulated based on traditional inventory. From 2017 to 2019, an ethnobotanical documentation of the plants growing in district Reasi (a part of Jammu Himalaya) was carried out to collect information regarding different usages of the plant species growing in the region through questionnaire and interviews. Floristically, a total of 90 species belonging to 80 genera and 48 families were investigated to be used as economic plants for medicine, food, herbal tea, fire and tanning purposes. The species distribution patterns across the families were unequal, with half of the species contributed by 12 families, 5 families with 2-3 members, and 31 families were monotypic. In terms of the functional trait diversity, herbaceous and perennial woody forms were dominant over the other forms. Out of 90 plant species, 10% were used as single usage, 27% double usage and 63% multi-usage. PAST software, a multivariate ecological community analysis software, was used to find the relationship between ethnobotanical usage and plant species. Four plant usages (clusters) were determined at a vertical distance value of 0.5, where the clusters are distinctly separated.

	abstract = {Objective: This study sought to analyze the gene expression of Candida albicans in sound root surface and root caries lesions, exploring its role in root caries pathogenesis. Methodology: The differential gene expression of C. albicans and the specific genes related to cariogenic traits were studied in association with samples of biofilm collected from exposed sound root surface (SRS, n=10) and from biofilm and carious dentin of active root carious lesions (RC, n=9). The total microbial RNA was extracted, and the cDNA libraries were prepared and sequenced on the Illumina Hi-Seq2500. Unique reads were mapped to 163 oral microbial reference genomes including two chromosomes of C. albicans SC5314 (14,217 genes). The putative presence of C. albicans was estimated (sum of reads/total number of genes≥1) in each sample. Count data were normalized (using the DESeq method package) to analyze differential gene expression (using the DESeq2R package) applying the Benjamini-Hochberg correction (FDR<0.05). Results: Two genes (CaO19.610, FDR=0.009; CaO19.2506, FDR=0.018) were up-regulated on SRS, and their functions are related to biofilm formation. Seven genes (UTP20, FDR=0.018; ITR1, FDR=0.036; DHN6, FDR=0.046; CaO19.7197, FDR=0.046; CaO19.7838, FDR=0.046; STT4, FDR=0.046; GUT1, FDR=0.046) were up-regulated on RC and their functions are related to metabolic activity, sugar transport, stress tolerance, invasion and pH regulation. The use of alternative carbon sources, including lactate, and the ability to form hypha may be a unique trait of C. albicans influencing biofilm virulence. Conclusions: C. albicans is metabolically active in SRS and RC biofilm, with different roles in health and disease. © 2020, Bauru School of Dentistry, University of Sao Paulo. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Beef cattle breeding has developed in extensive grazing systems in Mexi-co, concerning the livelihood of over one million families and affecting the use of natural resources. Reproductive efficiency is a major determinant of both the environmental impact of the herd, and the economic viability of the cow-calf production system. As reproductive traits have low heritabili-ty, reproductive efficiency can be largely influenced by herd management practices. Thus, a questionnaire was administered as personal interviews to 3280 producers, to investigate the prevalence of practices that could directly influence the reproductive outcome of their cattle. Results show that year-round breeding (93%) and natural service by the bull (97.4%) are the most common mating methods. However, only 41% of producers evaluate the breeding soundness of their bulls, and diagnostic testing for specific reproductive diseases of the sires is barely performed in 20% of the farms. The main declared reason for replacing the bull is old age (26.8%), which is followed by to avoid inbreeding (68.4%). Less than 10% of the operations use methods for the synchronization of the estrous cycle, and most farmers breed their heifers for the first time after 2 years of age (73%). Diagnosis of pregnancy is performed in merely 31% of operations, with 23% of the producers declaring to discard non-pregnant cows. Energy or protein feed supplements are provided to the cattle in 63% of the production units, whilst mineral supplements are given in 79% of the farms. Calves are typically weaned between 6 months and a year of age (85%). Only 16% of operations vaccinate against brucellosis and 17.5% against other reproductive diseases (IBR-DVB-VSR and Leptospirosis). The present study showcases a low frequency of adoption of basic reproductive management practices by cow-calf operations in Mexico. Advancement of these practices, as well as implementation and promotion of associated technologies, denotes an area of opportunity to improve the reproductive efficiency of the national herd. © 2020 Arantzatzu Lassala et al.},

The objective of this study was to find associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within candidate genes and fertility in the breeds Landrace and Duroc. Animals with breeding values for total number of piglets born, were re-sequenced for exonic regions of 14 candidate genes related to male and female fertility using samples from 16 Landrace boars and 16 Duroc boars (four with high and four with low breeding value of total number of piglets born for each breed for male fertility, and the same for female fertility) to detect genetic variants. Genotyping for the detected SNPs was done in 619 Landrace boars and 513 Duroc boars. Two SNPs in BMPR1 and one SNP in COX-2 were found significantly associated with the total number of piglets born in Landrace. In Duroc, two SNPs in PLC z, one SNP in VWF and one SNP in ZP3 were found significantly associated with total number of piglets born. These SNPs explained between 0.27% and 1.18% of the genetic variance. These effects are too low for being used directly for selection purposes but can be of interest in SNP-panels used for genomic selection. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The increasing public concern for animal welfare has pushed the poultry sector to progressively replace conventional battery cages (CC) for laying hens with alternative systems such as enriched cages (EC) and aviaries (AV). The aim of this study was to compare laying performance, egg location, and egg quality associated with these three housing types. The experiment was conducted in twelve pilot-scale chambers fitted out with one of the three treatments. Each chamber housed 30 Lohmann LSL-Lite laying hens from 23 to 32 weeks of age. The available area was 492, 780, and 1120 cm²/hen for CC, EC, and AV, respectively. The EC and AV chambers were equipped with nest boxes, perches, and a pecking/scratching area (PSA). In the AV chambers, hens had free access to a space arranged in three levels with a wood shaving litter on the ground level as a PSA. Hen-day production was recorded and egg quality assessment included egg cleanliness, weight and proportion of each component (albumen, yolk, and shell) but also pH, Haugh unit, and meat spots for albumen; color intensity and blood spots for yolk; thickness and resistance for shell. The laying rate and egg weight were similar for CC and EC (around 96.5% and 59.5 g; P > 0.05). For AV, these parameters were significantly lower (77.2% and 58.6 g; P < 0.001) but the differences compared to the cage systems progressively reduced across time. Nearby 70% of the eggs were laid in the nests with EC while almost all of the eggs were laid on the litter at ground level with AV. The rate of clean eggs was around 77% for both cage systems compared to 14% for AV. Most of egg quality traits were identical for the three systems (P > 0.05) but there was a lower yolk proportion for eggs laid in AV (25.2% versus 25.7% for cages systems; P < 0.001) and higher shell resistance for eggs laid in CC (40.7 N versus 39.3 N for alternative systems; P < 0.001). Lower laying performance observed with AV could be explained by higher animal activity and competition for facilities, but these factors were not measured in this study. The reduction of the difference in egg productivity over time compared to cage systems suggest the need for a period of training/adaptation for pullets/hens kept in such an environment. An enriched cage system seems a balanced solution that combines both laying productivity and improved animal welfare. Further research should be performed to improve acceptance and appropriate use of resources by birds in an aviary system. © 2020},

Differential traits of biomedical and ecological importance, such as invasive and allergenic potential have been demonstrated in both cryptic species. Therefore, in this work, we discuss about the potential for hybridization between these anisakid species in sympatric zones, implementing a multi-marker Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping approach based on the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase 2 (Cox-2) and a new nuclear marker, the highly conserved β-tubulin gene (β-TUB). The two cryptic species differed at least in 7 bp in the β-TUB gene and some larvae with heterozygous genotypes at the 7 diagnostic nucleotide positions were found. Taxonomic, population and genealogical analyses served to support the occurrence of hybridization between both species. Predicted restriction endonucleases enzymes were assayed for Cox-2 and β-TUB markers. The implemented multi-marker PCR-RFLP allowed us to detect the two pure parental species, F1 hybrids, hybrid backcrossed progeny and individuals with nuclear-mitochondrial discordance, being a useful, simple and reproducible procedure in any laboratory for epidemiological studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the associations between ambient air pollutants, obesity, and kidney function. Subjects/methods: We enrolled 3345 people who had undergone health checkups at Seoul National University Hospital. We recorded the annual average concentrations of ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤10 μm (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO), in each subject’s residential area. Various obesity traits, such as body mass index, waist circumference, and visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas, were measured by quantified computerized tomography (CT), and kidney function was assessed in relation to estimated glomerular filtration rate as an indicator of kidney function. Results: High PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations were significantly associated with decreased kidney function (β = −2.39 and standard error = 0.32, −1.00 and 0.31, −1.23 and 0.28, and −1.32 and 0.29, respectively), and with the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The association between air pollutant concentrations and decreased kidney function, including CKD, was stronger among those with high abdominal adiposity, as defined by CT measurement. For example, the association between increased concentrations of air pollutants and the prevalence of CKD was stronger in the group with greater visceral adiposity than in the group with less visceral adiposity (aORs = 1.29 vs 1.16 for PM10, 1.42 vs 1.21 for SO2, and 1.27 vs 1.11 for CO). Conclusions: Long-term exposure to higher concentrations of air pollutants was unfavorably associated with kidney function and CKD prevalence, especially in people with abdominal obesity. This may indicate a high susceptibility to air pollutants in obese people. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Background: Candidosis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by yeasts of the genus Candida, which normally reside on the surfaces of the mucous membranes and in the skin of several animal species and healthy humans; however the fungi can convert into pathogenic microorganisms and result in invasive infections with systemic involvement due to the impairment of the immune system. Systemic candidosis is rare in dogs and few reports of this mycosis are available in literature. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe three cases of systemic candidosis associated to canine distemper virus in dogs, highlighting the main epidemiological, clinical and pathological aspects. Cases: Three cases of systemic infection by Candida sp. were diagnosed in dogs. The animals predominantly presented neurological clinical manifestations, followed by unspecific alterations with an evolution of 5 to 30 days. Macroscopically, the lesions were characterized by white-yellowish multifocal to coalescent areas surrounded by reddish borders in the kidneys and heart (cases 1, 2 and 3); liver and submandibular lymph node (case 1); and lung (case 2). In the brains of the three dogs were observed multifocal, blackened and/or reddish and friable areas. In case 1, was observed an increased volume of the right carpometacarpal joint, that when cut, released a reddish and turbid content. In case 2, there was deposition of a whitish lumpy material on the epicardial surface, aorta artery, pericardial sac and spleen; infarction on the right testicle, hydroureter, pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis. Microscopically, the lesions consisted of necrossupurative inflammation associated to hemorrhage, vasculitis, congestion, thrombosis, infarction and fungal structures with distinct morphological patterns which included blastoconidia, pseudohyphae and hyphae. The fungal structures were strongly positive for the anti-Candida albicans polyclonal antibody in the immunohistochemistry. All 3 dogs were concomitantly infected by the canine distemper virus, and 2 of the animals also presented other comorbidities. Discussion: The diagnosis of systemic candidosis was made based on the morphotintorial characteristics of the agent and confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The yeasts of the genus Candida live as commensals, but when there is an imbalance of the normal microbiota or the immune system of the host is impaired, the yeasts can convert themselves into opportunistic pathogenic microorganisms. The concomitant infection with the canine distemper virus may have favored the infection and proliferation of the agent in the tissues, as the virus causes immunosuppression. The extensive vascular lesions associated to fungi in the vascular lumen and wall observed in the affected organs suggest hematogenous dissemination causing acute infarctions. The clinical signs of systemic candidosis are extremely variable and reflect the affected organs and hardly ever the infections are considered in the differential diagnoses. The dogs presented neurological clinical signs compatible with canine distemper, however the other clinical alterations were unspecific and insufficient to correlate with a secondary infection and none of the cases diagnosed in the necroscopic examination suggested systemic candidosis during the clinical investigation. The histochemical methods used in this study contributed effectively for the prior diagnosis of candidosis, making evident the variable morphological characteristics of the fungi. It is concluded that the systemic candidosis in dogs with canine distemper affects young and adult animals with predominantly neurological and unspecific clinical signs resulting from necrossupurative and vascular lesions in several organs, including the articular involvement little described in dogs and testicular lesions only reported in humans. © 2020 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

	abstract = {Three isolates of Ehrlichia ruminantium (Kümm 2, Omatjenne and Riverside), the causative agent of heartwater in domestic ruminants, were isolated in Ixodes scapularis (IDE8) tick cell cultures using the leukocyte fraction of infected sheep blood. All stocks were successfully propagated in IDE8 cells, whereas initiation attempts using endothelial cell cultures were unsuccessful. Therefore, the new technique should be included in any attempt to isolate field strains of E. ruminantium to enhance the probability of getting E. ruminantium isolates which might not be initiated in endothelial cells. Draft genome sequences of all three isolates were generated and compared with published genomes. The data confirmed previous phylogenetic studies that these three isolates are genetically very close to each other, but distinct from previously characterised E. ruminantium isolates. Genome comparisons indicated that the gene content and genomic synteny were highly conserved, with the exception of the membrane protein families. These findings expand our understanding of the genetic diversity of E. ruminantium and confirm the distinct phenotypic and genetic characteristics shared by these three isolates. © 2020.

	abstract = {Lowering milk production of high yielding dairy cows before dry-off may be beneficial for both physical health and welfare of the cow. Extending the milking intervals as well as restricting energy intake are the commonly used approaches to decrease milk secretion, but are mostly accompanied by adverse side effects. Our objective was to elaborate a new technique for reducing milk production taking the natural process of weaning into account, i.e. the abatement of the calf`s milk removal when shifting its diet from milk towards solid feed. We tested a software module by which the degree of udder emptying can be gradually decreased through automated early removal of the milking clusters over 10.4 ± 1.8 days on 26 Holstein cows that were close to dry-off and free of mastitis (SCC < 100,000 cells/mL and negative bacteriology in quarter milk samples). Milk yield was compared to 30 conventionally milked control cows, which had the same initial milk yields and fulfilled the same udder health criteria. After the period of incomplete milking, milk production immediately before dry-off was 35.3 ± 12.9% less in the experimental cows compared to the control cows. As expected, the duration of milking decreased with time of incomplete milking. Neither SCC nor bacteriology findings were altered by leaving residual milk in the udder. Ultrasonographic investigation of pre- and post-milking teat characteristics showed that all traits of inner teat morphology except teat end width were less changed through the incomplete milking process when compared to the changes occurring in the conventionally milked control cows (differences in changes ranged from - 2.0% for teat width to - 27.9% for the distal teat canal`s surface). These findings suggest that the mechanical strain on the teat was considerably decreased with termination of the milking process before udders were completely emptied. After several days of incomplete milking, the perimeter and the surface of the distal teat canal of the experimental teats were even smaller before attachment of the clusters when compared to the pre-milking values of the control teats, which might reflect a strengthening of the teat canals` functional defense mechanisms against the invasion of potential pathogens. Assessments in the following lactation showed that neither milk yield nor udder health were impeded by the targeted automated reduction of milk production before dry-off. The software module tested herein thus provides an effective tool for facilitating the dry-off process. © 2020},

	abstract = {Introduction Numerous studies have found associations between characteristics of urban environments and risk factors for dementia and cognitive decline, such as physical inactivity and obesity. However, the contribution of urban environments to brain and cognitive health has been seldom examined directly. This cohort study investigates the extent to which and how a wide range of characteristics of urban environments influence brain and cognitive health via lifestyle behaviours in mid-aged and older adults in three cities across three continents. Methods and analysis Participants aged 50 79 years and living in preselected areas stratified by walkability, air pollution and socioeconomic status are being recruited in Melbourne (Australia), Barcelona (Spain) and Hong Kong (China) (n=1800 total; 600 per site). Two assessments taken 24 months apart will capture changes in brain and cognitive health. Cognitive function is gauged with a battery of eight standardised tests. Brain health is assessed using MRI scans in a subset of participants. Information on participants' visited locations is collected via an interactive web-based mapping application and smartphone geolocation data. Environmental characteristics of visited locations, including the built and natural environments and their by-products (e.g., air pollution), are assessed using geographical information systems, online environmental audits and self-reports. Data on travel and lifestyle behaviours (e.g., physical and social activities) and participants' characteristics (e.g., sociodemographics) are collected using objective and/or self-report measures. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Australian Catholic University, the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong and the Parc de Salut Mar Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Government of Catalonia. Results will be communicated through standard scientific channels. Methods will be made freely available via a study-dedicated website. trial registration number ACTRN12619000817145. IntroduCtIon Dementia prevention is a global health priority. Around 40 50million people suffer from dementia worldwide and these figures are expected to almost double by 20301 2 due to population ageing.3 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is not severe enough to meet strengths and limitations of this study ? By recruiting participants from residential areas stratified by walkability, air pollution and socioeconomic status from three cities varying in exposures and lifestyle behaviours, this study will allow a robust estimation of dose response relationships of urban design and the relevant by-products (e.g., pollution) with brain and cognitive health. ? This study will provide a comprehensive assessment of multiple environmental factors and multiple lifestyle behaviours by which environments may affect brain and cognitive health. This will allow improved understanding of which environmental characteristics are related to brain and cognitive outcomes and by which mechanisms. ? The focus on locations visited for daily activities rather than only residential neighbourhoods will enable a more accurate estimation of individual exposure to features of the urban environment. ? The comprehensive assessment of lifestyle behaviours and individual-level moderators (apolipoprotein E genotype, physical health and personality traits) will assist the identification of optimal patterns of lifestyle activities that can be integrated in individually tailored lifestyle interventions, taking into account individual genetic factors and environmental living conditions. ? Current resources can support only two assessments, 24 months apart. This may not be a sufficiently long period to detect changes in certain exposures and/or outcomes. by copyright.

	abstract = {The use of functional material can help mitigate the pollution by heavy metals, which presents an array of risks to human production and life. This work provides a comprehensive review of the current knowledge on functionalized layered double hydroxide (LDH) as a heavy metal absorption material, by synthesizing the information from a total of 141 relevant publications published since 2005. LDH provides a potentially highly efficient method to adsorb heavy metal ions, which is simple to prepare and of low cost. The lack of functional groups and structural components of pristine LDH, however, limits the absorption capacity and widespread applications of LDH. Through intercalation, surface modification, or loading on substrates, functional groups or structural components are introduced into the pristine LDH to prepare functionalized LDH. In this process, the hydroxyl group and the valence state of [Mg(OH)6] octahedrons play a crucial role. Functionalized LDH can be endowed with selective absorption capacity and enhanced stability and recyclability. After adsorbing heavy metal ions, functionalized LDH can be readily separated from the liquid phase. These aspects are discussed, along with the structure and composition, shape and size, and synthesis methods and research tools of LDH. This work concludes with the discussion of preparation and utilization and a look to the future in terms of identified research needs regarding the preparation, use, and recycling (or upcycling) of economical and environmental-friendly LDH.  © 2020 Zhen Tang et al., published by De Gruyter 2020.},

	abstract = {Bianca di Saluzzo (BS) and Bionda Piemontese (BP) are two Italian chicken breeds, mainly reared for meat production, primarily in antibiotic-free farming. However, technical information on their growth pattern is still missing. At hatching, 150 unsexed chicks of each breed were weighed, labeled, and reared in indoor pens up to 8 w of age. At 8 w of age, the chicks were separated by sex and randomly transferred to growing pens with access to an external paddock (15 birds/pen; 4 pens/sex for each breed). The body weight (BW) was recorded biweekly for each bird, from hatching to 32 w of age. In order to identify an improvement strategy, the objectives of our study were to analyze the growth pattern of these birds using the Gompertz mathematical model and compare results with other chicken breeds. Polymorphism of the PAX7 gene was also analyzed to test its association with growth traits. Both BS and BP are close to unselected native breeds and, among the Italian local poultry, they are confirmed to be slow-growing birds with an intermediate size between heavy and light chicken breeds. Regarding the PAX7 gene, two alleles were found, F and G, and showed an association with the actual BW in the BP females from 14 w of age onwards. The G allele always exhibited a more favorable effect than the F allele. In small size poultry population, a delicate balance between preservation of biodiversity and performance improvement should be considered. Consequently, the most proper way could be an approach based on a mating scheme to keep inbreeding under control, increase growth rate, and improve commercial maturity. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Context: The lengthy process of treatment in burns units requires the patient to be hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) for a few days up to several months. Aims: The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of planned family presence at the patient's bedside in BICU on the family's anxiety. Setting and Design: The present randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on the family members of patients hospitalized in the BICU in Sari from March to May 2016. Materials and Methods: Selected through nonrandom sampling and randomly divided into a control and an intervention group (n = 30 per group). In the intervention group, one patient family member visited the patient for an hour each day from the 4th to the 8th day of admission. The control group received only the routine services of the unit, which meant keeping out all family members from the BICU. Statistical Analysis Used: The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety questionnaire was filled out in both groups on days 3 and 8 after the intervention. The data analysis were performed using SPSS version 21 (IBM). Results: Comparing the means of the two groups after the intervention using the independent t-test showed a statistically significant difference (t = 1.51, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The regular planned presence of family members at the patient's bedside in the BICU can effectively reduce anxiety in the family members and thus improve the care procedure. © 2020 MEDKNOW.},

	abstract = {Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular signaling and communication, allowing the intercellular exchange of proteins, lipids, and genetic material. Their recognized role in the maintenance of the physiological balance and homeostasis seems to be severely disturbed throughout the carcinogenesis process. Indeed, the modus operandi of cancer implies the highjack of the EV signaling network to support tumor progression in many (if not all) human tumor malignancies. We have reviewed the current evidence for the role of EVs in affecting cancer hallmark traits by: (i) promoting cell proliferation and escape from apoptosis, (ii) sustaining angiogenesis, (iii) contributing to cancer cell invasion and metastasis, (iv) reprogramming energy metabolism, (v) transferring mutations, and (vi) modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) by evading immune response and promoting inflammation. Special emphasis was given to the role of EVs in the transfer of drug resistant traits and to the EV cargo responsible for this transfer, both between cancer cells or between the microenvironment and tumor cells. Finally, we reviewed evidence for the increased release of EVs by drug resistant cells. A timely and comprehensive understanding of how tumor EVs facilitate tumor initiation, progression, metastasis and drug resistance is instrumental for the development of innovative EV-based therapeutic approaches for cancer.},

	abstract = {Like many important crops, peanut is a polyploid that underwent polyploidization, evolution, and domestication. The wild allotetraploid peanut species Arachis monticola (A. monticola) is an important and unique link from the wild diploid species to cultivated tetraploid species in the Arachis lineage. However, little is known about A. monticola and its role in the evolution and domestication of this important crop. A fully annotated sequence of ≈2.6 Gb A. monticola genome and comparative genomics of the Arachis species is reported. Genomic reconstruction of 17 wild diploids from AA, BB, EE, KK, and CC groups and 30 tetraploids demonstrates a monophyletic origin of A and B subgenomes in allotetraploid peanuts. The wild and cultivated tetraploids undergo asymmetric subgenome evolution, including homoeologous exchanges, homoeolog expression bias, and structural variation (SV), leading to subgenome functional divergence during peanut domestication. Significantly, SV-associated homoeologs tend to show expression bias and correlation with pod size increase from diploids to wild and cultivated tetraploids. Moreover, genomic analysis of disease resistance genes shows the unique alleles present in the wild peanut can be introduced into breeding programs to improve some resistance traits in the cultivated peanuts. These genomic resources are valuable for studying polyploid genome evolution, domestication, and improvement of peanut production and resistance. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {In Uganda, the role of ticks in zoonotic disease transmission is not well described, partly, due to limited available information on tick diversity. This study aimed to identify the tick species that infest cattle. Between September and November 2017, ticks (n = 4362) were collected from 5 districts across Uganda (Kasese, Hoima, Gulu, Soroti, and Moroto) and identified morphologically at Uganda Virus Research Institute. Morphological and genetic validation was performed in Germany on representative identified specimens and on all unidentified ticks. Ticks were belonging to 15 species: 8 Rhipicephalus species (Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, Rhipicephalus evertsi evertsi, Rhipicephalus microplus, Rhipicephalus decoloratus, Rhipicephalus afranicus, Rhipicephalus pulchellus, Rhipicephalus simus, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus tropical lineage); 5 Amblyomma species (Amblyomma lepidum, Amblyomma variegatum, Amblyomma cohaerens, Amblyomma gemma, and Amblyomma paulopunctatum); and 2 Hyalomma species (Hyalomma rufipes and Hyalomma truncatum). The most common species were R. appendiculatus (51.8%), A. lepidum (21.0%), A. variegatum (14.3%), R. evertsi evertsi (8.2%), and R. decoloratus (2.4%). R. afranicus is a new species recently described in South Africa and we report its presence in Uganda for the first time. The sequences of R. afranicus were 2.4% divergent from those obtained in Southern Africa. We confirm the presence of the invasive R. microplus in two districts (Soroti and Gulu). Species diversity was highest in Moroto district (p = 0.004) and geographical predominance by specific ticks was observed (p = 0.001). The study expands the knowledge on tick fauna in Uganda and demonstrates that multiple tick species with potential to transmit several tick-borne diseases including zoonotic pathogens are infesting cattle. © 2020, The Author(s).},

Poultry biodiversity is seriously threatened, and its safeguard is a strong objective in developed countries. According to the FAO, which emphasized the importance of native breeds for its country of origin, the aim of this study was to present the first contribution on eggs quality for endangered the Siciliana chicken breed and deepen knowledge on the local Livorno breed. At 20 weeks of age, 108 laying hens (54 Siciliana breed and 54 Livorno breed) were divided into six homogeneous groups of 18 hens each and reared according to requirements imposed by the EC Regulation 889/08 for organic production. The production cycle was controlled over one year, and egg production was recorded daily by group. Eggs were collected, weighted, and measured. Physico-chemical parameter and fatty acids profile were analyzed and nutritional indexes calculated. The statistical model included the effects of breed (Siciliana, Livorno). Egg production was 190 egg/head for Siciliana and 180 for Livorno group. The results showed similar values for Siciliana and Livorno egg quality, highlighting several valuable quality traits from these breeds which might be taken into account for conservation programs. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Particulate matter exposure during in utero life may entail adverse health outcomes later in life. The microvasculature undergoes extensive, organ-specific prenatal maturation. A growing body of evidence shows that cardiovascular disease in adulthood is rooted in a dysfunctional fetal and perinatal development, in particular that of the microcirculation. We investigate whether prenatal or postnatal exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) or NO2 is related to microvascular traits in children between the age of four and six. Methods: We measured the retinal microvascular diameters, the central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE), and the vessel curvature by means of the tortuosity index (TI) in young children (mean [SD] age 4.6 [0.4] years), followed longitudinally within the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. We modeled daily prenatal and postnatal PM2.5 and NO2 exposure levels for each participant's home address using a high-resolution spatiotemporal model. Results: An interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 exposure during the entire pregnancy was associated with a 3.85-μm (95% CI, 0.10 to 7.60; p = 0.04) widening of the CRVE and a 2.87-μm (95% CI, 0.12 to 5.62; p = 0.04) widening of the CRAE. For prenatal NO2 exposure, an IQR increase was found to widen the CRVE with 4.03 μm (95% CI, 0.44 to 7.63; p = 0.03) and the CRAE with 2.92 μm (95% CI, 0.29 to 5.56; p = 0.03). Furthermore, a higher TI score was associated with higher prenatal NO2 exposure. We observed a postnatal effect of short-term PM2.5 exposure on the CRAE and a childhood NO2 exposure effect on both the CRVE and CRAE. Conclusions: Our results link prenatal and postnatal air pollution exposure with changes in a child's microvascular traits as a fundamental novel mechanism to explain the developmental origin of cardiovascular disease. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In animal farming, alternatives to antibiotics are required due to the increase of antimicrobial resistance. In this contest, tributyrin showed the ability to promote gut health, to modulate gut microbiota and to improve protein digestibility, leading also to higher growth performance. However, although the mode of action of tributyrin on the intestinal epithelial cells has been partially explained, its effects on lipid and protein metabolism needs to be investigated. This paper provides information about the influence of tributyrin on production traits, blood parameters, faecal microbiota and faecal protein excretion in weaned piglets. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tributyrin supplementation on the production traits, the main metabolic parameters and gut microbiota in weaned piglets. One hundred and twenty crossbred piglets (Large White × Landrace) were randomly divided into two experimental groups (six pens each; 10 piglets per pen): the control group (CTRL), that received a basal diet, and the tributyrin group (TRIB) that received the basal diet supplemented with 0.2% tributyrin. The experimental period lasted 40 days. Production traits were measured at days 14, 28 and 40. A subset composed of 48 animals (n = 4 for each pen; n = 24 per group) was considered for the evaluation of serum metabolic parameters and hair cortisol by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and faecal microbiota by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Our results showed that the treatment significantly increased body weight (BW) at day 28 and day 40 (p = 0.0279 and p = 0.0006, respectively) and average daily gain (ADG) from day 28 to day 40 (p = 0.046). Gain to feed ratio (G:F) was significantly higher throughout the experimental period (p = 0.049). Even if the serum parameters were in the physiological range, albumin, albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio, glucose and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) fraction were significantly higher in the TRIB group. On the contrary, tributyrin significantly decreased the urea blood concentration (p = 0.0026), which was correlated with lean gain and feed efficiency. Moreover, serum insulin concentration, which has a regulatory effect on protein and lipid metabolism, was significantly higher in the TRIB group (p = 0.0187). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that tributyrin can be considered as a valid feed additive for weaned piglets. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background: Endometrial regeneration is essential for normal endometrial function; however, it is unclear whether and how menstrual blood-derived stem cells (MenSCs) and platelet-derived growth factor (PGDF) are associated with this phenomenon. The present study explored this topic. Material/Methods: EM-E6/E7/hTERT cells were divided into 5 groups: control group, NC group, PDGF group, MenSCs group, and PDGF+MenSCs group. The effects of MenSCs and PDGF on cell proliferation, invasion, and microvascular formation of endometrial epithelium were investigated by CCK-8, Transwell, and tube formation assays, respectively. Mouse endometrial injury models were established and mice were randomly divided into control, model, PDGF, MenSCs, and PDGF+MenSCs groups. Pathological change was examined with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Microvessel formation of endometrial epithelium was estimated by detecting the expression of CD34 protein with immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Western blot analysis was used to detect the activation of Akt and Bad proteins in endometrial tissue. Results: MenSCs, PDGF, and the combination treatments significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of endometrial epithelium compared to the control and NC group. The combination of MenSCs and PDGF remarkably promoted re-epithelialization and endometrial repair. IHC staining analysis showed significant increases in CD34 expression of the endometrial tissue following treatment with PDGF and MenSCs. The combination treatments also markedly enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt and Bad in endometrial tissue.

	abstract = {The provision of a suitable, high-quality starter diet to piglets has been described as a potential tool to minimize effects on the sow's catabolism during lactation and decrease the lag time between weaning and first feed intake at the nursery stage. This study aimed to determine the effects of gruel creep feed on (1) the piglets' performance from pre-weaning to finishing and (2) the sows' catabolism during lactation and its subsequent reproductive performance. Sixteen hybrid sows were selected according to parity, and were allotted in three treatments: control (CON, n = =5) only maternal milk without creep feed; dry creep feed (DCF, n = =5) maternal milk + dry creep feed; gruel creep feed (GCF, n = =6) maternal milk + gruel creep feed. The treatment was randomly assigned to a litter from day 3 post-farrowing until weaning. The experimental unit pre-weaning was considered the litter. After weaning, the cages with four piglets were considered the experimental units. The sows' catabolism was measured weekly through body weight and backfat losses during the lactation, associated with plasma metabolites parameters. Weaning-to-estrus interval (WEI) and estrus duration were used to measure reproductive performance after weaning. A total of 136 piglets had the body weight (BW) and feed intake measured at birth and on days 7, 14 and 21 (maternity period); 35, 49 and 63 (nursery period) and 104 and 133 (growing and finishing period) to calculate the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). On day 14 and 28, six piglets by treatment were randomly euthanized to analyze of intestinal morphometry. Sows had similar (P > 0.05) body weight and backfat loss during the lactation among the treatments. Also, the plasma metabolites were similar, except BHB was higher in GCF sows than in the other groups (P < 0.05). Feed: gain ratio and ADFI at 3–7 d were greater in GCF than in DCF piglets. In the other traits of piglets' performance differences were not observed. The coefficient of variation of birth weight and weaning weight were no statistical differences among treatments. At d133, there was higher variability in weight of GCF animals in comparison with control group, and DCF animals were similar to other treatments (P < 0.05). Besides, at 28 days in the ileum, the lower villus height: crypt depth ratio (VH: CD) was observed (P < 0.05) in GCF in comparison to CON and, low crypt depth (CD) was observed for CON piglets related the other treatments (P < 0.05). In conclusion, creep feed provided to piglets did not influence on the piglets' performance from pre-weaning to finishing and was not able to enhance sows' reproductive performance. © 2019},

This article aims to review the recent technological advances of non-destructive and non-invasive techniques to provide objective data to evaluate carcass composition and quality traits of sheep and goat meat. We highlight imaging and spectroscopy techniques and practical aspects, such as accuracy, reliability, cost, portability, speed and ease of use. For the imaging techniques, recent improvements in the use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to assess sheep and goat carcass and meat quality will be addressed. Optical technologies are gaining importance for monitoring and evaluating the quality and safety of carcasses and meat and, among them, those that deserve more attention are visible and infrared reflectance spectroscopy, hyperspectral imagery and Raman spectroscopy. In this work, advances in research involving these techniques in their application to sheep and goats are presented and discussed. In recent years, there has been substantial investment and research in fast, non-destructive and easy-to-use technology to raise the standards of quality and food safety in all stages of sheep and goat meat production. © 2020 by the authors.},

Key elements include, first and foremost, correctly identifying species that differ strikingly in their morphology at different life stages because with growth, they change size by several orders of magnitude and have accompanying shape changes. We also review comprehensive field studies documenting the need for management actions to correct abnormal shifts in sex ratios caused by climate change. We highlight the need to describe those perturbations in terms that are clear to regulators and personnel responsible for management and conservation policies. Finally, we review several basic studies that enhance our understanding of how selection has shaped morphological, functional, and performance attributes, and describe how that knowledge can be applied to the tasks required for enhancing species recovery. © The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Water stress is one of the main abiotic stresses that reduce plant growth;this decrease is due to changes such as physiological changes and causes growth and production limitation that caused by drought stress.In order to evaluate the effects of drought stress on some morphological and physiological characteristics of tow wheat cultivars, a factorial experiment based on completely randomized design was conducted. The findings show that drought stress exacerbations result in the plant's response to stress due to increased wheat resistance. This response is due to changes in plant pigments, proline, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde, glucose, galactose, rhamnose and xylose, which ultimately influence these changes effects on the morphological characteristics of wheat.Drought stress reduces the concentration of carotenoids, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophylls, but glucose, galactose, rhamnose, xylose, proline, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde (in leaves and roots) and the chlorophyll a and b ratios were increased.Reduction of plant height, stem height, root length, fresh and dry weight of wheat treated with 250 g / l PEG compared to non-treatment were 0.264, 0.236, 0.394, 0.183 and 0.395, respectively.From the two wheat cultivars, the morphological characteristics of the N8720 increased compared to the Gonbad cultivar. Interaction effects of cultivar and drought stress showed that N8720 cultivar without treatment had the highest morphological characteristics, carotenoid concentration, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophylls a and b, and the above cultivar with 250 g / l PEG (drought stress) had the highest amount of proline, malondialdehyde, soluble sugars and enzymes in leaves and roots. Increasing activity of oxidative enzymes and soluble sugars in wheat under drought stress could be a sign of their relative tolerance to drought stress.

	abstract = {Boreal peatlands store an enormous pool of soil carbon that is dependent upon – and vulnerable to changes in – climate, as well as plant community composition. However, how nutrient availability affects the effects of climate and vegetation change on ecosystem processes in these nutrient-poor ecosystems remains unclear. Here we show that although warming promoted higher CH4 emissions, the concurrent addition of N counteracted most (79%) of this effect. The regulation effects of the vegetation functional group, associated with the substrate quality, suggest that CH4 emissions from peatlands under future warming will be less than expected with predicted shrub expansion. In contrast, N2O flux will be enhanced under future warming with predicted shrub expansion. Our study suggests that changes in greenhouse gas emissions in response to future warming and shifts in plant community composition depend on N availability, which reveals the complex interactions that occur when N is not a limiting nutrient. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Frost and drought are key stress factors limiting the growth and distribution of tree species. Resistance to stress involves energy costs that may result in trade-offs between different functional traits. Structures or mechanisms that can help to withstand stress imply differences in the carbon economy of the species. Although adaptive responses to frost and drought resistance are usually of a similar nature, they are rarely assessed simultaneously. We investigated these resistance mechanisms in 10 canopy tree species coexisting in the semi-deciduous subtropical forests of northern Argentina. We measured leaf lifespan, anatomical, photosynthetic and water relations traits and performed a thermal analysis in leaves to determined ice nucleation and tissue damage temperatures. Our results showed that evergreen and deciduous species have different adaptive responses to cope with freezing temperatures and water deficits. Evergreen species exhibited cold tolerance, while deciduous species were more resistant to hydraulic dysfunction and showed greater water transport efficiency. Further research is needed to elucidate resistance strategies to stress factors at the whole tree-and stand level, and possible links with hydraulic safety and efficiency among different phenological groups. This will allow us to predict the responses of subtropical forest species to changes in environmental conditions under climate change scenarios.  © 2020 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {Global warming has posed a number of challenges for agriculture. The key problem is water retention in soil. Existing irrigation methods are costly and ineffective. To solve this problem, a synthesis of a rare-cross-linked hydrophilic polymer material with the properties of a pectin-based superabsorbent was conducted. The paper considers the structure and moisture absorption of the polymer material “Solid water”. The hydration properties of the superabsorbent in its original state and after contact with pectins were determined using IR spectroscopy. Our research showed that the water-adsorbing ability is ensured by the presence of short-sized acrylamide residues, fragments with residues of carboxyl groups and polysaccharide units in the structure. The superabsorbent with pectin as a biodegradable component is able to retain a portion of water of hydration even during prolonged drying. The effect of the pH of the medium on the water absorption capacity and swelling of the superabsorbent “Solid water” was shown. This superabsorbent can be used in different types of soils, as confirmed by the studies conducted in distilled water, as well as in alkaline and acidic media. The polymer is characterised by the highest swelling values in an alkaline medium due to the electrostatic repulsion of dissociated carboxyl groups, formed as a result of the hydrolysis of acrylamide. This makes it suitable for use in leached soils, such as leached black soil (Chernozem) in the Voronezh region. IR spectroscopy showed the presence of the superabsorbent's functional groups that form supramolecular structures including bound water molecules with no additional coordinate covalent bonds present. Thus, the reactions can be characterised as processes with the elements of system self-organisation. © 2020 A. V. Zenishcheva, V. N. Semenov, V. A. Kuznetsov, P. O. Kuschev },

	abstract = {The aim of the study was to evaluate the welfare of dairy goats of 32 farms located in Northwestern Italy, applying an on-farm assessment protocol, centered on animal-, resources-and management-based measures. The farms were classified as ‘intensive’ or ‘semi-intensive’ according to access to pasture. During each on-farm visit, a checklist was compiled, based on specific scores for housing and management conditions, and animals’ nutritional status, health, and behavior. Finally, the possible association between welfare measures and productive and reproductive traits was assessed. Overall, we observed an adequate level of animal wellbeing both in intensive and semi-intensive farming systems. This is possible thanks to the increased knowledge on goat breeding characteristics, and to the fact that veterinarians and farmers understood the importance of welfare protection to achieve a better health. Higher milk production was associated to some management practices (presence of the owner on the farm, high frequency of bedding change), and to seasonal breeding (which was mainly performed in the intensive farming). Moreover, it was associated to a quantity of urea in the milk comprised between 33 and 44 mg/dL. In intensive farms, the prevalence of caseous lymphadenitis was significantly higher compared to non-intensive farms. The semi-intensive breeding system positively influences the animals’ behavior. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Sarcoids are the most common skin neoplasm in the Equidae family. Sarcoids are benign, but may cause severe damage in affected animals. Due to the high risk of post-treatment recurrence and the lack of an effective method of treatment, it is reasonable to perform studies on the molecular aspects of this neoplasm. Therefore, the present studies analyzed five genes (cell cycle control binding protein alpha, coronin 1b, metalloproteinase 2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 and vimentin) related to cell mobility and invasion traits. Primary healthy fibroblasts and sarcoid cells were obtained from skin biopsies. Cell lines were cultured in two different medium types with different concentrations of foetal bovine serum (10% and 0.5% FBS) to study its influence on the analyzed genes. Gene expression was measured using the real-time PCR method. The results showed significant differences in two genes (coronin and vimentin) depending on culture conditions. In conclusion, the results enabled finding two new genes, related to cell motility and invasion traits, in which gene expression is deregulated. Results of the study may put new knowledge into the complexity of the genetic background of this disease and show the importance of further analysis on this subject. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Climate change causes rising temperatures and extreme weather events worldwide, with possible detrimental time-lagged and acute impact on production and functional traits of cattle kept in outdoor production systems. The aim of the present study was to infer the influence of mean daily temperature humidity index (mTHI) and number of heat stress days (nHS) from different recording periods on birth weight (BWT), 200 d- and 365 d-weight gain (200 dg, 365 dg) of calves, and on the probability of stillbirth (SB), and calving interval (CINT) of their dams. Data recording included 4,362 observations for BWT, 3,136 observations for 200 dg, 2,502 observations for 365 dg, 9,293 observations for the birth status, and 2,811 observations for CINT of the local dual-purpose cattle breed “Rotes Höhenvieh” (RHV). Trait responses on mTHI and nHS were studied via generalized linear mixed model applications with identity link functions for Gaussian traits (BWT, 200 dg, 365 dg, CINT) and logit link functions for binary SB. High mTHI and high nHS before autumn births had strongest detrimental impact on BWT across all antepartum- (a.p.) periods (34.4 ± 0.79 kg maximum). Prolonged CINT was observed when cows suffered heat stress (HS) before or after spring calvings, with maximum length of 391.6 ± 3.82 d (56 d a.p.-period). High mTHI and high nHS during the 42 d- and 56 d a.p.-period implied increased probabilities for SB. We found a significant (P < 0.05) seasonal effect on SB in model 3 across all a.p.-periods, with the highest probability in autumn (maximum of 5.4 ± 0.82% in the 7 d a.p.-period). Weight gains of calves (200 dg and 365 dg) showed strongest HS response for mTHI and nHS measurements from the long-term postnatal periods (42 d- and 56 d-periods), with minimum 200 dg of 194.2 ± 4.15 kg (nHS of 31 to 42 d in the 42 d-period) or minimum 365 dg of 323.8 ± 3.82 kg (mTHI ≥ 60 in the 42 d-period). Calves born in summer, combined with high mTHI or high nHS pre- or postnatal, had lower weight gains, compared with calves born in other calving seasons or under cooler conditions. Highest BWT, weight gains, and shortest CINT mostly were detected under cool to moderate climate conditions for mTHI, and small to moderate nHS. Results indicate acute and time-lagged HS effects and address possible HS-induced epigenetic modifications of the bovine genome across generations and limited acclimatization processes to heat, especially when heat occurs during the cooler spring and autumn months. © The Author(s) 2020.

The data file consisted of 80,408 dairy control data, 9,286 delivery records from 1969 to 2016, with information on total milk production corrected for 305 days (TMP), lactation length (LL) and percentage of fat (% F). Analysis of variance was performed using the SAS PROC MIXED, using fixed effects of farm, calving season (PS), farm * calving season interaction and buffalo age class at calving (CABC), and the animal as random effect. Means were differentiated using the Tukey test. The average production was 1,963.42+713.94 kg TMP, 281.71+53.89 days for LL and 7.07+0.86 % for % F, with influence of farm, farm * PS interaction and CABC; farm, PS and farm interaction * PS; and CABC for TMP, LL and % F, respectively. The phenotypic correlations were 0.32, 0.03 and 0.26 for TMP and LL, TMP and % F, and LL and % F, respectively. From the results, it was concluded that the studied characteristics show reasonable phenotypic variability, making buffalo farming a promising activity in the national scenario. © 2020, International Buffalo Information Center, Kasetsart University.

Collectively, 80% of the studied variables displayed significant differences (P<0.05) between at least two shade treatments. Shading generally showed most pronounced effect on the physiological traits of the legume, whereby the stomatal conductance, photosynthetic and transpiration rate differed significantly among plants for all treatments. The non-shaded plants were observed to have superior growth and physiological responses than the shaded plants. Interestingly, the moderately shaded plants exhibited the highest yield per plant, which significantly differed from the non-shaded and heavily shaded plants. This indicated that winged bean can adapt to partial canopy cover, making it a potential nitrogen-fixing cash crop which can be planted together with fruit or oil trees in commercial plantations. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

	abstract = {The vaccine against gonadotropin releasing factor (GnRF), Improvac®, has recently emerged as an option for rearing market gilts up to heavier harvest weights. Improvac's® temporary suppression of the ovarian function and gonadal hormones results in greater feed intake and better welfare from avoidance of sexual behavioral problems. Based on 22 published articles, our meta-analysis has quantified the effect of immunizing gilts against GnRF on parameters relevant for pig producers, pork packers and retailers/consumers. The meta-analyses included growth performance and final harvest parameters, general carcass traits and yield of valuable meat, meat and fat quality parameters. Primary analyses considered studies without ractopamine, subgroup and additional analyses assessed the impact of co-variates. From the perspective of pig producers, primary analyses showed that immunized (IM) gilts have significantly (P < 0.001) increased average daily gain (+45.1 g/day) and daily feed intake (+0.19 kg/day), higher final live weight (+4.0 kg) and more backfat (+2.8 mm). From the perspective of the pork packers, IM gilts have heavier carcasses (+3.2 kg; P < 0.001), whereas dressing percentage is similar. IM gilts are less lean (−1.5% units; P < 0.001) and have 0.21% units more intramuscular fat (P = 0.001). The yield of ham, shoulder, and loin is similar, whereas the yield of belly is significantly higher (+0.28 kg; P < 0.001). There are no differences in meat quality parameters (color, pH24, and drip loss) between IM gilts and untreated gilts, whereas a lower iodine value in IM gilts indicates an improved fat quality. Further subgroup and additional analyses confirmed the validity of our meta-analysis. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Acute herpes zoster (AHZ) is a common skin disease caused by invasion of the varicella zoster virus into the ganglia and skin, and the severe pain is the most complaint, which can seriously disturb the normal life of patients. Fire needle plus cupping is a special acupuncture treatment, which is widely used to treat AHZ for its better analgesic effect in China although it has not been fully verified by rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods/design: To test the effect, a three-arm randomized parallel controlled trial protocol has been designed. A total of 105 AHZ patients suffering pain will be randomly divided into three groups in an equal proportion. The interventions are fire needle plus cupping (FC) in group A, famciclovir plus gabapentin (FG) in group B, and fire needle plus cupping plus famciclovir (FCF) in group C. The length for the trial is set for a week time frame. Precisely speaking, the A group (FC) is to carry out 1 treatment per day for the total of 7 treatment sessions within 1 week period. On the other hand, the B group (FG) will take drugs orally three times a day within the trial 1 week. Meanwhile, with its combination element, the C group (FCF) is due to undertake both treatments and drugs as prescribed for A and B groups within the trial week. As an intra-trial arrangement, analgesic medication will be carefully administered for temporary pain release if the sudden intolerable pain appeared. For the primary outcome, this study is due to apply visual analogue scale to identify pain intensity relief. As the secondary outcomes are concerned, this study is aiming to focus on the issues related to changes in substance P and beta-endorphin concentrations in peripheral plasma, as well as those issues of analgesic needs, side effects, symptoms, and physical signs including pain classification, local itching, burning sensation, fever, local lymphadenopathy, skin lesion area, blisters, herpes clusters, vesicular traits, ulcers, and pimples; all these are taken into account for evaluation. For the final stage, the participants are to be followed up for postherpetic neuralgia. Discussion: The results of this trial aim to provide sufficient evidence on FC treatment over both FG and FCF treatments. It will then give a credible alternative treatment to cut down acute pain and to cure AHZ infection. Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1800015372.

However, the current visual scoring system has some disadvantages such as strong subjectivity, poor repeatability and low accuracy, and is prone to missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Artificial intelligence technology based on deep learning is expected to overcome these problems. In our study, we found that the convolutional neural network can be used to accurately extract internal features related to the treatment and prognosis of tumors, such as tumor-stroma ratio, nerve invasion and spatial distribution of lymphatic cells in tumor specimens, visualizing and digitalizing the curative effect of drug intervention on disease progression, and can quantify and automatic evaluate the expression of molecular biomarkers related to clinical treatment, classification and prognosis.

	abstract = {Evaluation of genetic and phenotypic trends is important to monitor the evolution of dairy cattle breeding programs. Traits that are not commonly included as selection goals should also be monitored, especially when they have some effect on consumer health, such as milk fatty acids profile. Thus, the aim was to evaluate the genetic and phenotypic trends of the milk fatty acids composition on a Holstein dairy cattle population, from three farms, reared in a tropical environment. Monthly records of palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), oleic (C18:1), total saturated (SFA), unsaturated (UFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated (PUFA) fatty acids content in milk (g/100 g of milk), were collected of 2047 Holstein cows from three Brazilian farms between May and December of 2012. The pedigree file contained 7963 animals of seven generations. Genetic and phenotypic trends were obtained by linear regression of breeding values or phenotypic values, respectively, over generations. Single-trait analyses were performed and the breeding values were estimated using Bayesian approach. All traits showed negative phenotype trend (−0.02723 g/100 g of milk to −0.00395 g/100 g of milk), indicating reduction of the phenotypic value over generations. According to the genetic trends for MUFA and PUFA (−0.00023 and −0.00005, respectively, in g/100 g of milk) the breeding values of the animals were reduced throughout the generations, while for SFA, C16:0 and C18:0 the genetic trends (0.00134, 0.00052 and 0.00013, respectively, in g/100 g of milk) showed an increase in breeding values, possibly due to correlated effects originated from selection protocols applied to the herd. The linear regression coefficients of the genetic values in the generations were not significant for UFA and C18:1 (p-value > 0.6226 and p-value > 0.9708, respectively). Significant genetic and phenotypic trends of small magnitude were obtained, which may be a consequence of the absence of direct selection for these traits in these populations. Genetic and phenotypic gains for fatty acids profile in milk should be monitored to guide breeding programs in their selection objectives. It is suggested to investigate the causes of possible correlated response in the studied populations. © 2019},

	abstract = {The present investigation evaluated the influence of seasonality and locality on the structure of the parasite community of the catfish Pimelodus blochii. A total of 160 fish were collected from two rivers in the State of Acre, western Brazilian Amazon: 80 fish in River Acre and 80 in River Iaco, with 40 in each season (rainy and drought). The overall prevalence was 78.7% and 1461 parasite specimens (adults and larvae) were allocated in 22 taxa: 5 of Monogenea, 10 of Nematoda, 3 of Digenea, 1 of Cestoda and 3 of Crustacea. In drought season, Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) pimelodus and Demidospermus peruvianus were more prevalent in River Acre and Iaco, respectively. The parasite diversity (Brillouin index) as well as the prevalence and abundance of the monogeneans D. peruvianus, D. striatus, Demidospermus sp. and Ameloblastella sp. were higher in River Acre. The parasite community structure were dissimilar among rivers, and seasonally in River Iaco. These results suggest that environmental traits may overshadow seasonal influences on the parasite community structure, which may be related to the higher anthropization in River Acre. Furthermore, seasonality exerted less influence on the parasite community than expected, probably because the two rivers have different hydrological traits than those of other rivers in the Brazilian Amazon. New host and locality records expanded our knowledge of parasite biodiversity of P. blochii. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The xCELLigence real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system has the potential to detect cellular proliferation, migration, cytotoxicity, adherence, and remodeling. Although the RTCA system is widely recognized as a noninvasive and efficient tool for real-time monitoring of cellular fate, it cannot describe detailed cell morphological parameters, such as length and intensity. Transforming growth factor beta(TGF-β) induced the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which produces significant changes in cellular morphology, so we used TGF-β to treat A549 epithelial cells in this study. We compared it with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) as stimulators. We developed an efficient algorithm to quantify the morphological cell changes. This algorithm is comprised of three major parts: image preprocessing, Hough transform (HT), and post-processing. We used the RTCA system to record the A549 cell index. Western blot was used to confirm the EMT. The RTCA system showed that different stimulators produce different cell index curves. The algorithm determined the lengths of the detected lines of cells, and the results were similar to the RTCA system in the TGF-β group. The Western blot results show that TGF-β changed the EMT markers, but the other stimulator remained unchanged. Optics-based computer vision techniques can supply the requisite information for the RTCA system based on good correspondence between the results. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has recognised that the production of pre-sexed livestock by sperm or embryo sexing as a useful breeding tool to increase production efficiency, especially for traits that are sexrelated. In this chapter, we briefly explain sex determination in mammals, review approaches to identifying X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm and their practical implications for semen handling and artificial insemination (AI) and compare their importance and success in the main farm animal species. The problems associated with current technology for sperm sexing, as reflected in the damage caused to mammalian sperm are then considered, followed by an assessment of the potential for replacing this technology by other methods. In mammals, the most efficient method to bias sex ratios in offspring is to separate X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm by flow cytometry before insemination. Numerous other techniques purporting to alter the sex ratio have been proposed or discussed. None of these were able to produce significant separation of fertile X and/or Y sperm populations or were not repeatable. Only quantitative methods, which differentiate between X and Y sperm on the basis of total DNA and then apply flow cytometric sorting, have been able to separate the two sperm populations with high accuracy. Sperm are labelled with a DNA fluorescent dye. After recognition and electric charging, droplets containing single sperm are deflected and pushed into a collection medium from which they are further processed. This set-up allows the identification and selection of individual sperm into populations with sort purities above 90% of the desired characteristics A critical point is the orientation of sperm in front of a UV laser, requiring modifications of a standard flow cytometer. A specially designed nozzle assembly hydrodynamically focusses the sperm-containing laminar core stream by means of a sheath fluid and the specific geometrics of the internal assembly parts. Sperm sorting requires special liquid media. For example, a system based on TRIS extender has been developed for bull and ram semen. Besides TRIS and other ingredients, the medium contains antioxidant scavengers to combat reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the Hoechst dye 33342. Porcine semen is handled in a similar way, except that the sample fluid is based on TRIS-HEPES. The sample fluid for stallion semen is generally based on skim milk, INRA 96 or Kenney's modified Tyrode (KMT). Sorted samples are collected in tubes prefilled with collection medium. The composition of this medium is, in most cases, a TEST-yolk extender, supplemented with seminal plasma in order to decapacitate the collected sperm. In the animal industries, changing the sex ratio of offspring can increase genetic progress and productivity. Animal welfare can be improved, for example, by decreasing obstetric difficulties in cattle and minimising environmental impacts by eliminating the unwanted sex. Sexed sperm has been most widely applied in the dairy industry, and it is likely that this will continue, dependent on the market situation. For US dairy farmers, milk production and the sale of surplus calves and cull cows are as important as the production of replacement heifers on-farm. Outside the USA, at least in Europe and Australia, the demand for sexed sperm is potentially high for milk producers to optimise herd management. In these countries, the genetically superior cows will be bred with X chromosome-bearing sperm to produce genetically superior females with high milk yield and for (female) pregnant heifer export to other countries. Besides AI, embryo transfer (ET) can be performed after insemination with sex-sorted sperm. The combination of sex-sorted sperm with in vitro embryo production (IVEP) is advantageous, but much more difficult than ET, and depends on species, individual semen donor and composition of media used for in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and in vitro culture. Commercialisation of sex-sorted ram sperm has, to date, been restricted by the dearth of commercial sorting facilities in Australia and New Zealand, although sheep are the only species in which sex-sorted frozen-thawed sperm have been shown to have comparable, if not superior, fertility to that of non-sorted frozen-thawed controls. Moreover, there has been little incentive to take up the technology due to low rates of adoption of genetic improvement programmes and/or artificial breeding technology. In pigs, apart from economic benefits from faster growth rates, sex-sorted sperm would provide major welfare advantages through the elimination of surgical castration. However, the current method of individual sperm sorting is not efficient enough to satisfy the potential demands of the porcine AI industry, due to the high number of sperm required for each insemination. For special applications, such as building up nucleus herds or for research, sexed boar sperm can be utilised in combination with specially adapted insemination strategies. A signifi-cant reduction in the total sperm dose, maintaining fertility, can be achieved if porcine semen is deposited deep in the uterus in front of the utero-tubal junction or directly into the oviduct. Only very few sperm are required for IVF using in vivo or in vitro matured oocytes. Transferring both gametes into the oviduct at the same time (gamete intrafallopian transfer-GIFT) can be used as an alternative to IVF. Even fewer sperm are required for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) than for all other IVF methods. However, to date, these methods require laparoscopy or laparotomy for insemination, embryo or gamete transfer, which are not practicable as alternatives to castration. In horses the preferred gender depends on the breed and range of use. Stallion sperm have a low sorting index and their sortability varies, not only among stallions but also among ejaculates. Additionally, the freezability of stallion sperm varies widely. Insemination with sex-sorted sperm has to be performed by hysteroscopy deep into the uterine horn, limiting the technology to high-value animals. The sex-sorting process can cause sperm damage. The main sources of damage are incubation with the fluorescent stain and exposure to the UV laser, mechanical forces and electrical charge. Future sorting methods may avoid the need to identify quantitative differences between X and Y chromosome-bearing sperm. This would require a specific marker related to only one sex. A promising system is based on gold nanoparticles, which can be functionalised with DNA probes. After internalisation of the probe into the sperm head, the Y chromosome-bearing sperm can be identified due to their strong plasmon resonance, which is more stable than fluorescent dyes. Non-invasive coupling of a specific DNA probe with the intact DNA double strand by triplex binding and accumulation of nanoparticles has been achieved, but to date internalisation of the gold nanoparticles requires further research. Another promising new method promotes the naturally occurring genomic variations by gene editing. It is not a question of if, only when these methods will be ready for the market and replace the existing sexing techniques. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

	abstract = {Although high diversity of parasitic ciliates has been reported in China, little is known about the species from high altitude areas, especially in Tibet. To investigate the species of parasitic ciliates in Tibet, a project was initiated in the Chabalang wetland in 2013. Two Trichodina species, namely, Trichodina sp. and T. reticulata Hirschmann & Partsch, 1955, were isolated from gills of an invasive fish, Micropercops swinhonis for the first time. In the present study, we provided the morphological, morphometrical, and molecular characterizations of the two species and conducted the phylogenetic analyses of mobilids based on the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rDNA) sequences. Both morphological characters and morphometric data of the T. reticulata agreed well with previous studies. Although two partial SSU rDNA sequences were obtained in the present study, only the sequence of T. reticulata population in the present study was thought to be reliable. The other sequence may not belong to the other species. Thus, we regarded the other species isolated in the present study as Trichodina sp. to avoid the wrong or confused species identification. Morphologically, Trichodina sp. is distinguished mainly by its large body shape with a broad adhesive disk, robust and obliquely quadrilateral blades, and well-developed rays. T. reticulata is mainly characterized with the 8–12 spherical or elliptical granules in the central zone of adhesive disk. Phylogenetic analyses consistently showed the two ectoparasites clustered with freshwater species of the genus Trichodina within the order Mobilida. Our study extended the host range of T. reticulata and supplemented the molecular data. Also, results reveal that invasion of exotic fish may cause a potential threat to native fish by introducing or dispersing parasitic ciliates. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The influence of muscle type and postmortem storage period on meat chemical composition and quality attributes of three breeds of camels (Baladi Saudi, Pakistani, and Somali) were investigated in this study. Crude fat and ash content were significantly higher in the Pakistani than in the Baladi Saudi and Somali breeds, except for higher moisture content observed in the Somali breed. The longissimus lumborum (LL) and semimembranosus (SM) muscles had a greater crude protein than the biceps femoris (BF) muscle. Storage period exhibited a significant reduction in pH values and improvement in color components of meat. The Somali breed produced higher cooking loss% and shear force, with a lower water holding capacity than the Baladi Saudi and Pakistani breeds. The LL muscle had better cooking loss %, water holding capacity, and shear force, whereas storage period (7 days) exhibited a significant reduction in the myofibrillar fragmentation index. Baladi Saudi and Pakistani breeds and LL muscle samples presented better meat sensory attributes, while storage period had no significant influence on the overall sensory characters of meat. In conclusion, there were significant differences between the chemical and structural characteristics of the LL, BF, and SM muscle samples among the three breeds of camel. Baladi Saudi and Pakistani had better meat quality traits than the Somali breed. In addition, LL muscles had better nutritional values and meat quality parameters than BF and SM muscles. Improvement in meat quality attributes were achieved with the storage process of 7 days. It is observed that, the Saudi Baladi camels have a merit of low fat content over both Somali and Pakistani camel breeds. It is also concluded that no significant effects were observed between the treatments as a result of storage when sensory attributes were considered. Moreover, breed, muscle and storage period were interacted significantly only with regard to lightness color space and shear force.

	abstract = {Bacillary necrosis of Pangasius (BNP), caused by Edwardsiella ictaluri, is one of the most devastating diseases in striped catfish farming. To date, quantitative genetic inheritance of BNP resistance is not known in striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus. The main aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for BNP resistance in a breeding population of striped catfish undergoing four generations of selection for high growth. Specifically, the study examined whether BNP resistance is heritable to enable family selection and whether genetic improvement for enhanced BNP resistance may have detrimental effects on growth and survival rate. To test these hypotheses, 720 full- and half-sib families were challenged with E. ictaluri pathogen using injection and cohabitation methods over four years, from 2010 to 2012 and 2015. In total, the data included 398,234 animals in the pedigree, from which 18,849 animals had disease challenge test records and 39,103 siblings had growth performance. Both univariate and bivariate sire–dam linear and threshold mixed models were used to estimate (co)variance components for BNP resistance, survivals and growth traits. The estimates of heritability for the BNP resistance recorded as death or survival were low regardless of models used (0.10–0.16), whereas survival time (days post-challenge test) showed moderate heritability (0.35). The survival rate during hapa rearing had medium heritability (0.33–0.52). The genetic correlations of BNP resistance with body weight and survival were all positive (0.03–0.53), suggesting that selection of increased BNP resistance may have positive impacts on growth and survival traits, and these traits could be easily improved simultaneously in the selective breeding programme for striped catfish. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Several major risk factors for cancer involve vascular oversupply of energy to affected tissues. These include obesity, diabetes and chronic inflammation. Here, we propose a potential mechanistic explanation for the association between energy oversupply and cancer risk, which we call the metabolic cancer suppression hypothesis: We hypothesize that oncogenesis is normally suppressed by organismal physiology that regulates and strictly limits normal energy supply to somatic cells, and that this protection is removed by abnormal oversupply of energy. Methodology: We evaluate this hypothesis using a computational model of somatic cell evolution to simulate experimental manipulation of the vascular energy supply to a tissue. The model simulates the evolutionary dynamics of somatic cells during oncogenesis. Results: In our simulation experiment, we found that under plausible biological assumptions, elevated energy supply to a tissue led to the evolution of elevated energy uptake by somatic cells, leading to the rapid evolution of both defining traits of cancer cells: Hyperproliferation, and tissue invasion. Conclusions and implications: Our results support the hypothesis of metabolic cancer suppression, suggesting that vascular oversupply of energetic resources to somatic cells removes normal energetic limitations on cell proliferation, and that this accelerates cellular evolution toward cancer. Various predictions of this hypothesis are amenable to empirical testing, and have promising implications for translational research toward clinical cancer prevention. © The Author(s) 2019.},

	abstract = {Cancer epithelia show elevation in levels of sulfated proteoglycans including dermatan sulfates (DS). The effect of increased DS on cancer cell behavior is still unclear. We hypothesized that decreased expression of the enzyme Iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) can lead to increased DS levels, which would enhance the invasion of cancer cells. Breast cancer sections shows depleted IDS levels in tumor epithelia, when compared with adjacent untransformed breast tissues. IDS signals showed a progressive decrease in the non-transformed HMLE, transformed but non-invasive MCF-7 and transformed and invasive MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively, when cultured on Type 1 collagen scaffolds. DS levels measured by ELISA increased in an inverse-association with IDS levels. Knockdown of IDS in MCF-7 epithelia also increased the levels of DS. MCF-7 cells with depleted IDS expression, when imaged using two photon-excited fluorescence and second harmonic generation microscopy, exhibited a mesenchymal morphology with multiple cytoplasmic projections compared with epithelioid control cells, interacted with their surrounding matrix, and showed increased invasion through Type 1 collagen matrices. Both these traits were phenocopied when control MCF-7 cells were cultivated on Type 1 collagen gels polymerized in the presence of DS. In monolayer cultures, DS had no effect on MCF-7 migration. In the context of our demonstration that DS enhances the elastic modulus of Type 1 collagen gels, we propose that a decrease of IDS expression leads to accumulation within cancer epithelia of DS: The latter remodels the collagen around cancer cells leading to changes in cell shape and invasiveness through fibrillar matrix milieu. © 2019 by the authors.

Live weight (LW, kg) of 42 purebred Wallachian lambs (from 33 ewes) was recorded during four control days with approximately 30-day intervals during rearing. At the same time, their mothers were examined for milk production (kg), milk fat (g), proteins (g), lactose (g), and fatty acids (%) contents. Results investigated using linear regression analysis showed 5.93 kg (p < 0.05) increase of lambs LW corresponded with 1 kg of ewe’s daily milk production increase during the observed period. Similarly, significant 0.13 kg or 0.11 kg increases of lambs live weight corresponded with 1 g increase of milk protein or milk lactose at this time. Milk with higher prevalence of trans-palmitoleic acid, trans-vaccenic acid, cis-vaccenic acid, linolelaidic acid, linoleic acid, or conjugated linolenic acid (CLA) significantly improved lambs LW. Moreover, significantly positive Pearson partial correlation between LW and trans-vaccenic acid (r = 0.305) or CLA (r = 0.347) indicated on genetic correlation between these traits. Therefore, milk (natural or artificially supplied) with higher distribution of these specified FAs could improve lambs’ LW. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Organic pig production may be conducted with different genetic types and the carcass outcome can differ in fatness content, however, the contribution of each effect to meat quality characteristics is not well established. The objective of this study was to evaluate two genetic types (Duroc x (Gascon x Duroc), Duroc-sired vs. Pietrain x (Landrace x Large White), Pietrain-sired) slaughtered at a different weights to achieve similar target carcass fatness (90 kg or 105 kg of body-weight, respectively), and the effect of two carcass lean grades (<60% or ≥60% lean) on growth rates, carcass and pork quality under organic husbandry. The daily gain and carcass yield were lower in Duroc than in Pietrain-sired pigs. The post-mortem and ultimate pH, moisture, lightness (L*), yellowness (b*), cooking loss and intramuscular fat content of loin meat were not influenced by genetic type, while redness (a*) and tenderness (shear force) were lower in Duroc than their Pietrain counterparts. Partition tree analysis showed that the highest shear force (≥4.63 kg) and the highest fat depth at Gluteus medius muscle (≥16 mm) were associated with Duroc-sired pigs. The lowest redness (a*<2.23) was associated with leaner (≥60%) pork. The crossbred finishing pig including 75% Duroc genes showed lower growth performance, carcass weight and dressing out than the Pietrain sired crossbreds. Lean grade was not associated with earlier differences in growth, carcass performance or meat quality, except for a tendency for greater compression at 80%force in leaner raw pork. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a leading cause of reproductive failure in sows and respiratory disorders in all ages of pigs; PRRSV is one of the most serious threats to the global pig industry. Continuously monitoring the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of PRRSV epidemic strains is beneficial for PRRSV prevention and control. In this study, we detected PRRSV from different types of porcine samples collected from 257 pig farms in Central (Henan Province) and South China (Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces) in 2016. Of the 1047 samples collected, 530 (50.62%) were positive for PRRSV by RT-PCR. The positive rates of virus detection for each of the geographical regions were higher than 44.25%. These findings suggest that the prevalence of PRRSV continues to be a major problem for the pig industry in China. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PRRSV2 was still the prevalent species in Central and South China, and highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) was the predominate PRRSV type. However, the emergence and circulation of novel PRRSV strains such as the GM2-like strains and NADC30-like strains is worrisome and should receive more attention. In terms of different geographical regions, HP-PRRSV strains were the predominate PRRSV strains circulating in South China, while both HP-PRRSV strains and NADC30-like strains appeared to be the predominate PRRSV strains in Central China (Henan Province). These findings demonstrate that PRRSV types circulating in different regions in China are some different. In addition, a number of amino acid mutation types including amino acid changes and deletions were observed in both the GP5 and Nsp2 proteins. Our study provides important information on the epidemiological and genetic characteristics of PRRSV strains currently circulating in China. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The implementation of photosynthetic organisms has received tremendous attention in the last two decades in order to achieve the products of high industrial value at the minimal cost of environmental carbon dioxide, water and nutrients. The advancement of molecular biology tools including the availability of completely sequenced genome of a variety of photoautotrophs has made their genetic modification possible for it. In the past decade, there was an increase in the discovery of novel biosynthetic pathways in photosynthetic organisms, but there are several challenges that need to be reported and solved for developing an improved engineered strain with desired traits. Genetic engineering tools are required not only to introduce novel pathways in the photosynthetic organisms but also to modify host metabolism. For solar biofuels, most of the metabolic engineering attempts have been applied on cyanobacteria and microalgae, mainly focused in this chapter. To modify cyanobacteria for production of biofuel, the efficiency of photon conversation should be targeted which in turn may allow effective utilization of solar energy. A combinatorial approach for developments of these strains, their selection, genetic engineering, optimization of bioreactors and processing technology may pave the way for the production of biofuels that can ensure future energy security in a sustainable manner. In a larger perspective, efficient photosynthetic machinery provides a solution for an efficient and large-scale biofuel production which holds the promise of replacing harmful non-renewable fossil fuels, which may eventually delay a shift in global climate change. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

	abstract = {Sharing landscapes with humans is an increasingly fraught challenge for wildlife across the globe. While some species benefit from humans by exploiting novel opportunities (e.g., provision of resources or removal of competitors or predators), many wildlife experience harmful effects, either directly through persecution or indirectly through loss of habitat. Consequently, some species have been shown to be attracted to human presence while others avoid us. For any given population of a single species, though, the question of whether they can recognise and change their response to human presence depending on the type of human actions (i.e., either positive or negative) has received little attention to date. In this study, we chose to examine the behavioural plasticity within a single population of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) to both positive and negative human activity. Within a relatively small and contiguous landscape, we identified areas where kangaroos experience a combination of either low and high frequencies of benign and harmful human disturbances. From six sampling sessions over five months, we found that density and group sizes were higher where humans acted benignly towards them, and that these groups had higher representations of sub-adults and juveniles than where humans had harmful intentions. Importantly, we found that the vital antipredator strategy of increasing group size with distance from cover was not detectable at sites with low and high levels of harm. Our findings suggest that these kangaroos are recognising and adjusting their behavioural response to humans at fine spatial scales, a plasticity trait that may be key to the survival of these species in human dominated landscapes. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Backyard poultry production plays a vital role in providing animal protein at affordable and sustainable manner. Growth and production potential of indigenous chicken need to be improved through selective breeding to enhance the productivity of backyard farming. PD-4 birds (Aseel, indigenous breed) were subjected to selection for higher body weight over eight generations. Study investigated effect of selection on the performance of PD-4 birds with respect to economic traits. There was significant improvement in body weight and shank length at 8 weeks of age. Egg production up to 40 weeks had improved by 19.1 eggs. Egg weight at 28, 32, 36 and 40 weeks of age improved by 0.8, 1.3, 1.7 and 1.3 g respectively. Age at sexual maturity had declined by 14.2 days. There was no significant change in fertility and hatchability traits. Survivors’ egg production up to 72 weeks of age was 156.5±2.79 eggs while hen day and hen housed egg production were 144.9 and 137.5 eggs respectively. Egg weight consistently improved from 35.13 g at age at first egg to 48.07 g at 40 weeks and to 49.63 g at 72 weeks of age. The study demonstrated that indigenous chickens could be improved for body weight and egg production without affecting other economic traits and improved PD-4 variety has the potential to be used as improved dual purpose indigenous chicken variety for low input backyard poultry farming. © 2019 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

	abstract = {Apple snails are large freshwater snails belonging to the family Ampullariidae that inhabit tropical to temperate areas. The South American apple snails Pomacea canaliculata and Pomacea maculata have been introduced to other continents where they have successfully established and spread. Our review aims to analyse the mechanisms of the impacts that these invasive Pomacea provoke or may provoke. Nine basic mechanisms were identified: Grazing/herbivory/browsing, competition, predation, disease transmission, hybridisation with native species, poisoning/toxicity, interaction with other invasive species, promotion of collateral damage of control methods on non-target species and when acting as prey. The most important impacts are those related to their grazing on aquatic macrophytes, algae and rice and their competition and predation on other aquatic animals, mostly macroinvertebrates, including other apple snails. Invasive Pomacea are also responsible for outbreaks of an emergent parasitic disease (human eosinophilic meningitis). Their great abundance in invaded areas, their bioaccumulation of pollutants and their natural toxicity may impact on their predators and on trophic webs through apparent competition, trophic cascades and biomagnification. The biota from manmanaged and natural wetlands may be unintentionally affected by mechanical, chemical and biological control against invasive Pomacea. Their capacity to hybridize may affect the distinctiveness and ecological traits of native Pomacea in invaded regions of America. Established populations of these invaders may either facilitate or resist the establishment of other exotic species. Field surveys and more realistic experimental approaches with multiple interacting species are needed to better understand the environmental impacts of invasive Pomacea and their underlying mechanisms. © CAB International 2019.},

Eight treatments arising from the factorial combination of four cultivars and two managements were randomly applied to 31-m2 plots in three blocks. Pasture dry matter production and growth rate were measured for one year. Three grazing assessments were performed to establish the grazing preferences of six dairy cows in spring, summer and autumn. High sugar cultivars produced less dry matter per hectare than the standard cultivars. Cows consumed more grass and harvested a greater proportion of the pasture under the agronomic management aimed at decreasing sugar concentration, i.e., with a greater nitrogen fertilization rate and under a more frequent defoliation regime, which could be explained by the greater crude protein concentration achieved under this management. The results suggest that the genetic selection for greater levels of sugars was at the expense of herbage yield, and that cows preferred to graze herbage with a greater crude protein level instead of a greater sugar concentration. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Beef cattle breeding has developed in extensive grazing systems in Mexico, concerning the livelihood of over one million families and affecting the use of natural resources. The diversity of climate, region, land tenure, herd size and poverty level potentially influence livestock farming. To detect areas of opportunity in the use of human, animal and natural resources, and to determine the degree of technological penetration, a structured questionnaire was administered as personal interviews to 3280 producers. Over 50% of farmers have an activity other than cattle breeding, mostly raising crops and other livestock. Weaned calves, primarily destined for the national market, are the foremost commercial product. Nevertheless, 20% of farmers in the northern region export their calves. European X Zebu crossbred cattle are widespread (over 45% of operations), followed by Bos taurus taurus breeds (22%). Criollo and predominantly Zebu cattle are present in <15% of farms, and dairy breeds in <5%. Over 70% of producers declared to select animal breed based on productive traits and adaptability, even though only 52% have record-keeping systems. The customary method to register data is hand-written, and < 7% of producers use computers. Recorded information comprises data on reproduction (59.1%), calves (44%), herd health practices (32%) and purchases and sales (28%). Over 95% of farmers identify animals by hot iron marks and National Individual Livestock Identification System (SINIIGA) ear tags. Close to 52% of animal breeders do not receive technical advice. Finally, according to producers, the main constraints for farm growth and profitability were lack of access to credit, followed by low market value of their products and insufficient infrastructure. © 2019 Everardo González-Padilla et al.},

	abstract = {                             Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), an important vector of West Nile virus (WNV) in the U.S.A., was first detected on the Galápagos Islands (Ecuador) in the 1980s. However, little is known of its ecology, distribution or capacity for arbovirus transmission in the Galápagos. We characterize details of lifecycle (including gonotrophic period), temporal abundance, spatial distribution, vector competence and host-feeding behaviour. Culex quinquefasciatus was detected on five islands of the Galápagos during 2006–2011. A period of 7–14 days was required for egg–adult emergence; water salinity above 5 ppt was demonstrated to hinder larval development. Blood-meal analysis indicated feeding on reptiles, birds and mammals. Assessment of WNV vector competency of Galápagos C. quinquefasciatus showed a median infectious dose of 7.41 log                             10                              plaque-forming units per millilitre and evidence of vertical transmission (minimal filial infection rate of 3.7 per 1000 progeny). The distribution of C. quinquefasciatus across the archipelago could be limited by salt intolerance, and its abundance constrained by high temperatures. Feeding behaviour indicates potential to act as a bridge vector for transmission of pathogens across multiple taxa. Vertical transmission is a potential persistence mechanism for WNV on Galápagos. Together, our results can be used for epidemiological assessments of WNV and target vector control, should this pathogen reach the Galápagos Islands.                          © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {A novel bio-nanocomposite was prepared by the combination of fungal biomass and Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles. The result of XRD and EDAX analysis indicated that Fe3O4 Actinomucor sp. bio-nanoadsorbent was prepared. Our experiments showed that the adsorption kinetics and isotherm of this material comply with the pseudo-second-order and the Langmuir models, respectively. The maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of this novel bio-nanoadsorbent was obtained as 29.49 mg/g. The thermodynamic analysis revealed that the adsorption of Cd2+ is spontaneous and exothermic. The optimum temperature, initial concentration, contact time and pH for adsorption system of cadmium were about 45 °C, 400 mg/L, 120 min and 7, respectively. Pretreatment of adsorbent by NaOH and SDS significantly increased cadmium adsorption capacity. SEM images showed that Fe3O4 nanoparticles were immobilized successfully on the fungus cell surface. Contribution of the carboxyl, hydroxyl, amine and Fe–O functional groups of the bio-nanoadsorbent in the binding to cadmium ions was revealed by FTIR analysis. Results from regeneration studies indicated reusability of the adsorbent up to 91%. According to experimental results, it could be claimed that bio-nanocomposite of Fe3O4−Actinomucor sp. is a novel efficient adsorbent for removal of metal ions from aqueous solutions, and hence it has potential to be used in the environmental pollution cleanup programs. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

To evaluate the potential of this technology in providing the amount of nitrogen requested by xaraés grass as topdressing, plants were fertilized at planting with an N rate of 100 kg ha-1, inoculated with strains of diazotrophic bacteria and Azospirillum brasilense, and compared with plants that received 100 kg ha-1 of N at planting and as topdressing during two periods of shoot growth (58 days in the first period and 26 days in the second period) in 20-dm3 pots. The data were subjected to analysis of variance and means compared by the Scott-Knott test at 5% significance. The leaf area of xaraés grass inoculated with strain UN42 was similar to that of plants that received nitrogen topdressing. However, grass biomass production was higher when nitrogen topdressing was applied. Plant inoculation with Azospirillum brasilense and strains UN16, UN17, UN21, UN33, UN49, and UN78 increased crude protein contents of xaraés grass when compared to nitrogen fertilization at planting without inoculation. However, grass inoculation with diazotrophic bacteria does not replace nitrogen topdressing completely. © 2019 Universidade Federal de Goias. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Numerous researchers have suggested that climate change affects both the onset and severity of cardiovascular and mental disorders at a population level, but its impact on higher mental functions (HMF) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) remains relatively unexplored. In order to evaluate the HMF and the autonomic regulation of the cardiac activity we examined forty-five individuals (18 males и 27 females; 18.7±0.6 year old) in September 2017 and February 2018. Assessment of ANS was performed by heart rate variability (HRV) measurement, where five-minute HRV recordings by three-lead electrocardiography (Cardio, Ukraine) were obtained at rest in supine position and during cardiovascular reflex tests (active tilt test and deep breathing test) followed by analyzes of standard time and frequency domain HRV parameters. HMF were assessed by 4 standard tests: Schulte tables and Anisimov-Bourdon test to assess the characteristics of voluntary attention; “Wellbeing-ActivityMood” questionnaire and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for evaluation of psycho-emotional status. Correlation analyses among autumn and winter registrations revealed significant associations between parameters of voluntary attention with wind velocity in September and with most of the meteorological factors in February. Most of the associations with meteorological factors (temperature and pressure) and anxiety were revealed during observation that coincided with the heat wave event in September 2017. Identified associations between RRNN, RMSSD, pNN50, LF, VLF and humidity were suggestive for increased sympathetic activity during both cardiovascular reflex tests and these effects were similar in September and February. Negative correlation between the temperature and RRNN also indicates an increase in sympathetic activity as temperature increases during the deep breathing test. These results suggest a moderate prevalence of the sympathetic regulation of the cardiac activity with low emotional stability during heat wave exposure that could be considered as a potential risk factor of cardiovascular morbidity brought about by climate changes. © 2019, Yerevan State Medical University.

	abstract = {Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) are invasive container mosquitoes that are of potential medical importance in the southern United States. Seeds (acorns) and leaves from oak trees can contribute seasonally to the detritus of larval container habitats. Herein, we examined the effect of acorns and leaves from the southern live oak (Quercus virginiana Mill.), which has a concomitant range with these mosquitoes, on the population performance of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. Three levels of acorns and oak leaves were used (0.99, 1.98, and 7.94 g), along with two mixtures (leaf + acorn: 0.50 + 1.48 and 1.48 + 0.50 g). Tannins, secondary plant metabolites that effect herbivory, were measured across all treatment levels; nitrogen and carbon was also measured for detritus and representative females. Survival, female mass, development time, and λ′ (per capita rate of population increase) were used to evaluate population performance of both species. Detritus amount but not type led to differences in tannins; however, these differences did not correspond to differences in performance. Acorns had higher carbon and C:N than leaves. Survival for both species was lower in medium amounts of acorns. Female mass varied with leaf amount, whereas development time differed between amounts of pure leaf and acorn. λ′ was lowest in medium and high acorns compared with leaves or mixtures. Thus, acorns do appear to limit mosquito survival and affect population growth, suggesting that inputs of this common detritus type may negatively affect container Aedes production. © The Author(s) 2019.

	abstract = {The incubation period of chicken eggs is 21 days; for meat-type birds, this represents approximately 60% of their life. In most cases, chicks are shifted from the hatchery when the majority (approximately 95%) of the chicks have hatched. This period time, added with the time required to transport the chicks to rearing farms, means that chicks can be deprived of water and feed for 2-3 days. Due to the specificity of the embryogenesis process and the unique avian eggshell structure, the development of the embryo could be directly manipulated via a small window that is cut into the egg-shell to allow access to the embryo. This ability has been used to develop the in ovo technique as a biotechnology approach, i.e. direct injection of bioactive and nutritional substances during the incubation process. Recent studies have shown major developments in the utilisation of this technique for early feeding and supply of carbohydrates and amino acids (more than 2.5% weight enhancement for broilers) or vaccination (Newcastle, Mareks Disease, with more than 2% immunity enhancement) in several commercial poultry farms particularly in Europe, United States and Brazil. Additionally, the injection of IGF type I (100 ng/egg from human origin) on the 3rd day of incubation increased the efficiency of growth and development of muscle during the first weeks of life resulting in more than 12% weight enhancement for broiler. The amniotic site has been considered the most effective for supplements injection, while the 18th day of chicken egg incubation is the most effective time. This review integrates recent aspects that could influence traits of interest for in ovo feeding in the poultry industry. © 2019 El-Sabrout et al.},

	abstract = {Cities within arid regions make up a significant but understudied subset of the urban ecosystems of the world. To assess the effects of urbanization, fragmentation, and land-use change in an arid city, we sampled the ant assemblages in three habitat types in Tucson, Arizona: irrigated neighborhood parks, urban desert remnants, and preserved desert. We analyzed the abundance, species richness, evenness, as well as the species and functional group composition of ant assemblages. We found no significant differences in species richness or evenness. However, irrigated parks had significantly greater ant abundances. Although some exotic species were present in the urban habitats, they did not have significant effects on ant diversity. Ant assemblages from all three habitat types were distinct from each other in their composition. Irrigated parks included a significantly higher proportion of species typically found in cooler and wetter climates. The differences in abundance and species composition between irrigated parks and the other habitats are likely the effect of irrigation removing water as a limiting factor for colony growth and increasing resource availability, as well as producing a localized cooling effect. Our results show that arid urban ecosystems may include considerable biodiversity, in part thanks to increased landscape heterogeneity resulting from the irrigation of green areas. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This study aimed to (1) identify cross-fostering (CF) practices employed on a commercial farm; (2) characterize CF pigs according to litter of origin traits, and (3) investigate the implications of CF practices on pig mortality, performance and welfare. This was an observational study whereby pigs were managed according to normal farming practice. Pigs (n = 1,016) born within 1 week were classified as non-CF (NCF); CF during the first (CFW1) and second or third (CFW2+) weeks of lactation. Pigs were individually weighed and inspected for the presence of tail (TL), ear (EL) and body lesions (BL) at weaning (7.03 ± 1.61 kg) and at the end of the first (12.9 ± 3.03 kg) and second (31.9 ± 5.50 kg) weaner and grower (66.3 ± 9.12 kg) stages. Mortality was recorded through to slaughter (c. 115 kg). At slaughter, TL were scored and carcass characteristics, presence of pleurisy, enzootic pneumonia, pericarditis and heart condemnations were recorded. 40.8% of CF pigs were CFW1; ANOVA tests revealed these were born to sows with a higher number of piglets born alive than NCF pigs (14.6 ± 2.61 and 12.8 ± 2.68, respectively). The remaining 59.2% of CF pigs were CFW2+; these were, on average, 0.14 kg lighter at birth than NCF pigs. Therefore, a nested case control design was retrospectively applied whereby pigs with complete records to slaughter, were matched for these variables to investigate associations between CF weeks, welfare and performance traits. Growth performance did not differ between CF week (P > 0.05); however, CFW2+ carcasses were 4.9 kg lighter (P < 0.05) compared with NCF and CFW1 pigs. EL were more likely in CFW1 compared to NCF and CFW2+ (P < 0.05) pigs. To investigate the effect of CF week on the risk of mortality, all 1,016 pigs were used. CF pigs were at higher risk of death (P < 0.05) with similar odds in CFW1 and CFW2+ pigs compared with NCF pigs, although other underlying factors could contribute to this result. Performance and health traits were similar between CF weeks. Early cross-fostering appeared to influence the presence of ear lesions but the mechanism is likely indirect and difficult to explain. © 2018 Calderón Díaz, García Manzanilla, Diana and Boyle.},

	abstract = {The additive under assessment is a muramidase from Trichoderma reesei DSM 32338 which is to be used as a zootehcnical additive in feed for chickens for fattening and minor poultry species. The production strain is a genetically modified microorganism. The introduced genetic sequences do not give rise to safety concerns and no viable cells and no DNA of the production strain were detected in the additive. The results of a tolerance trial in chickens for fattening showed that the birds tolerated well 10-fold the highest recommended level of 45,000 LSU(F)/kg feed. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the additive is safe for chickens for fattening and extrapolated the conclusion to minor poultry species for fattening. The enzyme filtrate used to formulate the additive was tested in genotoxicity studies and in a subchronic oral toxicity study. The results of these tests did not indicate any reason for concern for consumer safety arising from the use of the product as a feed additive. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the additive is safe for the consumers. The Panel could not conclude on the potential of the additive for skin/eye irritancy or for its skin sensitisation potential. Owing to the proteinaceous nature of the active substance, the additive is considered to have potential for respiratory sensitisation. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the use of this product as a feed additive poses no risks to the environment. The additive is to be used as a zootechnical additive, functional group other additives. To support the efficacy, the applicant submitted three efficacy studies with comparable design. The results showed significant and positive improvements on the feed to gain ratio of the birds receiving the additive at the lowest recommended level (25,000 LSU(F)/kg feed).

	abstract = {The research was carried out to study the effect of different farming systems on reproductive traits and body condition score in Deccani sheep. Ewes (36), 9-12 months of age, were divided in to 3 groups, viz. intensive (T1), semi-intensive (T2) and extensive farming system (T3) with 12 ewes in each group following completely randomized design. The results revealed that, body weight at puberty in intensive group (17.6 kg) was significantly higher than extensive (16.3) group. Age at puberty in extensive group was significantly higher (338 days) than intensive group (290 days). The conception rate in intensive group was 75%, which was higher than semi-intensive and extensive (58.3 and 66.6% respectively). Intensive group had achieved significantly higher body weight at lambing (24.74 kg) than semi-intensive (23.12 kg) and extensive (22.23 kg). Birth weight of lambs in intensive group (2.5 kg) was significantly higher than semi-intensive (1.98 kg) and extensive groups (1.82 kg). Length of estrus cycle and duration of oestrus differed nonsignificantly in different farming systems. BCS values were significantly higher during pregnancy in intensive group. BCS near parturition (48 h near) and BCS 3 months (post-parturition) was significantly higher in intensive as compared to semi-intensive and extensive. BCS (48 h after parturition) was significantly higher in intensive and semi-intensive systems with respect to extensive system. It can be concluded that reproductive traits and body condition score were higher in intensive system compared to other systems because care of life stages through provision of concentrate feed, with minimal body energy loss can be assured in intensive farming system. © 2018 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

The effects of climate change factors, such as elevated CO2, drought, and temperature on beneficial plant-microorganism interactions are increasingly being explored. Organisms live in concert with thousands of other species, such as some beneficial and pathogenic species which have little to no effect on complex communities. Since natural communities are composed of organisms with very different life history traits and dispersal ability, it is unlikely that all of the microbial community will respond to climatic change factors in a similar way. Among the different factors related to climate change, elevated CO2 had a positive influence on the abundance of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas the effects on plant-growth-promoting bacteria and endophytic fungi were more variable. The rise in temperature effects on beneficial plant-associated microorganisms were more variable, positive, neutral, and negative, which were equally common and varied considerably with the temperature range. Likewise, plant-growth-promoting microorganisms (i.e., bacteria and fungi) positively affected plants subjected to drought stress. In this chapter, we explore how climatic change affects soil microbes and plant-associated microorganisms. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {miRNA has shown its potential in the regulation of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, the mechanism of such an effect was not quite clear. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether miR-30a-5p participated in the regulation of cutaneous SCC (cSCC) and the possible mechanism involved. 5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) and cell cycle were measured using flow cytometry. The formation of cell colony was tested by colony formation assay. The capacities of migration and invasion were tested by wound healing assay and Transwell invasion assay, respectively. The target of miR-30a-5p was predicted by bioinformatics and identified by luciferase assay. Western blot was used for the determination of proteins and qPCR was for mRNA levels. miR-30a-5p expression was lowered in SCL-1 and A431 cells, and its upregulation suppressed EdU positive cells, colony numbers, migration, invasion and Bcl-2 expression, and elevated Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and cleaved Caspase-3 expressions, arresting cell cycle in G1 phase. Moreover, forkhead box protein G1 (FOXG1) was proved to be the target of miR-30a-5p, and FOXG1 overexpression partially offsets the decreased colony numbers, migration and invasion rates due to miR-30a-5p overexpression in SCL-1 and A431 cells. miR-30a-5p showed a regulatory role on the expression of FOXG1 and further modulated the progressing of cSCC cells, which could be a novel pathway intervening the development of cSCC. © 2019, AEPress, s.r.o.

	abstract = {Achatina fulica, the giant African snail, is the largest terrestrial mollusk species. Owing to its voracious appetite, wide environmental adaptability, high growth rate, and reproductive capacity, it has become an invasive species across the world, mainly in Southeast Asia, Japan, the western Pacific islands, and China. This pest can damage agricultural crops and is an intermediate host of many parasites that can threaten human health. However, genomic information of A. fulica remains limited, hindering genetic and genomic studies for invasion control and management of the species. Findings: Using a k-mer-based method, we estimated the A. fulica genome size to be 2.12 Gb, with a high repeat content up to 71%. Roughly 101.6 Gb genomic long-read data of A. fulica were generated from the Pacific Biosciences sequencing platform and assembled to produce a first A. fulica genome of 1.85 Gb with a contig N50 length of 726 kb. Using contact information from the Hi-C sequencing data, we successfully anchored 99.32% contig sequences into 31 chromosomes, leading to the final contig and scaffold N50 length of 721 kb and 59.6 Mb, respectively. The continuity, completeness, and accuracy were evaluated by genome comparison with other mollusk genomes, BUSCO assessment, and genomic read mapping. A total of 23,726 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled genome, among which 96.34% of the genes were functionally annotated. The phylogenetic analysis using whole-genome protein-coding genes revealed that A. fulica separated from a common ancestor with Biomphalaria glabrata ∼182 million years ago. Conclusion: To our knowledge, the A. fulica genome is the first terrestrial mollusk genome published to date. The chromosome sequence of A. fulica will provide the research community with a valuable resource for population genetics and environmental adaptation studies for the species, as well as investigations of the chromosome-level of evolution within mollusks. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

	abstract = {Superiority of hybrid maize cannot be overemphasized. Different types of hybrids are developed by plant breeders to improve productivity and multi-locational evaluation of these hybrids prior to release is necessary to select the best. The objectives of this study were to identify maize hybrids with superior agronomic potentials and compare the performance of top-cross and three-way cross hybrid maize varieties for grain yield and related traits under rain-fed condition in three different locations (Abeokuta, Ibadan and Akure) of Southwest Nigeria. The study consisted of ten hybrids each of top-cross and threeway cross hybrid varieties, tested with two checks. At each location, the experiment was laid out in randomised complete block design with three replications. The results showed that effects of locations, genotypes and genotype x location interactions were highly significant (p<0.01) for all the traits evaluated. Significant differences were also revealed between the top-cross and three-way cross hybrids for all the traits evaluated except days to 50% tasseling, ear diameter and 100-grain weight. The topcross hybrids were superior over the three-way cross hybrids for grain yield by 5.25%. The hybrids ‘M0926-7', ‘M0926-8', ‘M1026-11', ‘M1026-3', ‘M1226-2' (top-cross hybrids), ‘M1124-24', ‘M1124-27', ‘M1124-31', ‘M1227-6' and ‘M1227-7' (three-way cross hybrids) showed highest stable yields across the three locations. Hybrids ‘M0926-7' (top-cross hybrid) and ‘M1124-24' (three-way cross hybrid) that expressed early flowering with higher grain yield are recommended for drought stress prone areas because of their abilities to tolerate drought through escape. © 2019.

Lessening these issues is a key concern for the animal production industry. The primary aim of this research was to evaluate black soldier fly (BSF) performance when fed poultry, swine, or dairy manure at different rates (18 or 27 g/2 d until 40% prepupation). The results indicated that larvae fed with the control diet (Gainesville diet) were the heaviest (+31–70%); however, for other life-history traits, those fed the higher feed rate of poultry manure produced comparable results to the control. Larvae fed more resource, regardless of manure type, weighed more as larvae (+3–9%), pupae (+22–48%), and adults (+18–42%), developed faster (up to 3–4 d), had a higher percentage reach the prepupal stage (+2–16%), lived longer as adults (+1 d), and converted more resource to biomass (up to 1% more) than those fed at the lower rate. Yet, no difference was detected in dry matter (DM) reduction across feed rate for a given manure type. Based on these results, all three manure types can be digested by black soldier fly larvae, thus demonstrating their potential for waste management. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {An attempt was made to know the management system of intensive buffalo farming and buffalo derived -problems under semi-arid area of Bangladesh. Direct interview with farmers, farm observation, community discussion and key informant interview (KII) had been followed over six months in Dinajpur district. It was observed that buffaloes were reared under two types of management system namely household yard intensive (HYI) and completely intensive (CI). In HYI system, farmers purchased heifer or pregnant buffalo from local market and sold mother with calf after one year. Buffaloes were kept shed at night and maintained feeding, showering and other activities in the household yard at day. Those were showered by once-two times/week in cool day, but most of them were showered in a day. On the other hand, in CI system, buffaloes were reared inside the shed all time and maintain feeding, showering and other activities in the shed. Buffaloes were showered twice in a day in winter period while three times in summer period. Average milk production for each buffalo was 5 to 8 liter/day. Major productive and reproductive traits e.g. lactation Length (day), average milk yield (L/day), dry period (day), age at first pregnancy (month) and age at first calving (month) were found better in CI system than that of HYI system and those were found highly significant (P<0.001). Significant difference were found on total solids, fat and protein content but no significance difference were observed on SNF, lactose and ash of buffalo milk between two farms. Insignificant difference (P>0.05) was found for the value of electric conductivity (ECms/cm) that showed both farms produced healthy milk (3.25±0.49 vs 3.09±0.89). Both systems showed as a profitable venture (BCR 1.33 vs 1.25). Problem matrix revealed that the top ranked order of problem were “inadequate knowledge on buffalo rearing”, “high price of feed” and “low milk price” mentioned as 1, 2 and 3. Shortage of feeds and fodder, high temperature and lack of cow boy were ranked as 4, 5 and 6. Limited breeder bull, lake of AI workers and inadequate quality semen and credit facilities mentioned as 7 ranked problem. It was concluded that ensuring training and marketing could help to improve intensive system of dairy buffalo that meet up the growing demand of milk in urban people. Simultaneously AI facilities with quality semen, HYV fodder cultivation and credit facilities should be promoted for sustainable dairy buffalo farming. © 2019, International Buffalo Information Center, Kasetsart University.

	abstract = {The current review focuses on phenotypic characterization of West African cattle breeds for the development of breeding programmes for indigenous beef cattle genetic resources. Indigenous cattle breeds found in West Africa were identified and characterized using information from refereed journals, conference papers and research reports. A data mining exercise was carried out at the start of the review. Different literature search systems were used. The choice of a search system to be utilised was based on the database involved. Approximately 400 academic journal papers, refereed conference papers and peer reviewed research reports on livestock characterisation in Africa in general were found. A process of selecting the most relevant ones to the current review was carried out through scanning through each publication abstract. Results of this review indicates that smallholder cattle production in West Africa is extensive and dominated by indigenous cattle breeds with ability to adapt to the local environment. The breeds include Somba, Lagune, Muturu, N'Dama, Kuri, Maure, Azawak, Gudali, Shuwa, White Fulani, Djelli, Gobra, Ketekou, Ghana Sanga and Borgou. The contributions of these breeds to West African country's economy ranges from provision of food, cultural and ecological roles as well as a source of income. They also have adaptive traits including but not limited to tolerance to ticks and tick-borne diseases, heat and diseases such as trypanosomiasis. Although smallholder cattle farming systems contributes substantially to household food security and income, their productivity is hindered by several constraints including high prevalence of diseases and parasites, limited food availability and poor marketing. © 2019 Santoze and Mathiew.},

	abstract = {                             Background: The sustainability of farming and animal welfare requires the reconsideration of current selection schemes. In particular, implementation of new selection criteria related to animal health and welfare should help to produce more robust animals and to reduce anti-microbial use. The hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis plays a major role in metabolic regulation and adaptation processes and its activity is strongly influenced by genetic factors. A positive association between HPA axis activity and robustness was recently described. To explore whether selecting pigs upon HPA axis activity could increase their robustness, a divergent selection experiment was carried out in the Large White pig breed. This allowed the generation of low (HPA                             lo                             ) and high (HPA                             hi                             ) responders to adrenocorticotropic hormone administration. Results: In this study, we compared 23 hematologic and immune parameters of 6-week-old, HPA                             lo                              and HPA                             hi                              piglets and analysed their response to a low dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) two weeks later. At six weeks of age, HPA                             hi                              piglets displayed greater red blood cell and leucocyte number including CD8α                             +                              γδ cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, naive T helper (Th) cells and B lymphocytes as compared to HPA                             lo                              individuals. The ability of blood cells to secrete TNFα in response to LPS ex vivo was higher for HPA                             hi                              pigs. At week eight, the inflammatory response to the LPS in vivo challenge was poorly affected by the HPA axis activity. Conclusions: Divergent selection upon HPA axis activity modulated hematologic and immune parameters in 6-week-old pigs, which may confer an advantage to HPA                             hi                              pigs at weaning. However, HPA                             lo                              and HPA                             hi                              piglets did not exhibit major differences in the parameters analysed two weeks later, i. e. in 8-week-old pigs. In conclusion, chronic exposure to high cortisol levels in HPA                             hi                              pigs does not negatively impact immunity.                          © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The effectiveness of music therapy for relieving pain and anxiety during burn dressing changes has not been reported from India. Purpose: This study was conducted to assess the effect of music therapy on pain, anxiety, opioid use, and hemodynamic variables during burn dressing change. Methods: Patients in a tertiary care burn unit who were >10 years old, conscious, able to respond, and oriented to time, place, and person participated in a 2-month, quasi-experimental, cross-over pilot study. Each served as his/her own control. Dressings were changed every other day alternating between the control (standard pain management) and experimental (control plus patient-selected music) intervention. Pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale, anxiety was scored using the State Trait Anxiety Test (higher scores indicated more pain and anxiety), and hemodynamic parameters and analgesics were recorded. Wilcoxon Test and chi-squared tests were utilized for statistical analysis. Results: Median pain scores (5, interquartile range [IQR] IQR: 3-7; and 6, IQR: 5-8) and median anxiety scores (12, IQR: 8-17; and 14, IQR: 10-19) were significantly lower during the experimental than during the standard dressing change, respectively (P <.001), and opioids were used significantly less frequently during the experimental change (P ≤ .002). Conclusion: Music therapy helps reduce anxiety, pain, and opioid use during burn dressing change. © 2018 HMP Communications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Reducing the prevalence of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension (PH) remains a challenge to high-altitude beef production systems. Previous research and selection strategies have focused on the impact of bulls with PH in gain-test; however, little information is available on heifers that are typically developed in grazing systems. We hypothesized that indicator traits for PH in heifers are genomically associated with growth traits. The objectives of this study were to 1) identify SNP associated with yearling mean pulmonary arterial pressure (YPAP) and growth traits, 2) evaluate sequence variants common to YPAP and growth traits, and 3) identify underlying genes for QTL in Angus cattle. Yearling heifers (n = 1180) grazing in a high-altitude beef production system were measured for YPAP. Additionally, growth measures such as age of dam adjusted birth weight (BW), 205 d weaning weight (WW), 365 d yearling weight (YW), 365 d hip height (HH), and 160 d post-weaning gain (PWG) were also recorded. Isolated DNA from blood, hair, or blood card samples were analyzed using the Ilumina BovineSNP50 Beadchip. Genome-wide association analyses were conducted using an additive multi-locus mixed model with a 5% false discovery rate to account for multiple comparisons. Genotypes adjusted for FDR (P ≤ 1.00E−05; number of SNP) were associated with BW (2), YW (1), PWG (1), and HH (6), but no SNP were associated with YPAP or WW at this significance level. Associated SNP (P ≤ 1.00E−03; number of SNP) were identified for YPAP (37), BW (42), WW (31), YW (38), PWG (36), and HH (65). There was one SNP concordant with YPAP, YW, and HH, another with YPAP, YW, and PWG, and one SNP was concordant between YPAP and BW. Underlying genes within 1 kb of concordant SNP were SLC36A2 and CFAP58 and are involved in small amino acid transportation and cell cycle processes, respectively. Results suggested that 2 genomic regions may co-associate YPAP and growth traits. However, given these SNP accounted for <0.05 percentage of the genomic variance, selection for growth will have limited influence on YPAP and subsequently incidence of hypoxia-induced PH in beef heifers developed in grazing systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

EMT contributes to increased cancer cell motility and invasiveness mainly through invadosomes, the adhesion structures that accompany the mesenchymal migration. The invadosomes and their associated proteases restrict protease activity to areas of the cell in direct contact with the ECM, thus precisely controlling cell invasion. Our data prove that Snail-overexpressing HT-29 cells that imitate the phenotype of colon cancer cells in the early stage of the EMT showed an increase in the expression and pericellular activity of cathepsin B. It appears that the pericellular localization of cathepsin B, also observed in colon and rectum adenocarcinoma tissue samples, plays a key role in its function. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Animal robustness may be defined as a complex trait characterizing the ability of an individual to be adapted, productive and healthy under contrasted and fluctuating environmental situations. Such a trait is now considered an essential criterion in order to meet the more ambitious goals of farming sustainability. In ruminants, one of the key mechanisms via which robustness is expressed is the capacity to mobilize or restore body reserves (BR) to cope with the challenges of negative energy balances. The objectives of this work were as follows: 1) to estimate the genetic parameters related to BR dynamics in ewes over successive production cycles and 2) to investigate BR management relationships between different physiological stages. For this, historical individual BW and BCS data from 2,920 phenotyped ewes were used for genetic analysis. The changes in BW (ΔBW) and BCS (ΔBCS) over time were analyzed. Eight physiological stages were considered to investigate these changes over time: mating, early pregnancy, mid-pregnancy, lambing, early suckling, mid-suckling, weaning, and postweaning. The estimated heritability were low for both ΔBW (h2 = 0.13 to 0.18) and ΔBCS (h2 = 0.04 to 0.16). Moderate to high positive genetic correlations (from 0.48 to 0.91) were obtained between BR mobilization phases and between BR accretion phases. Similarly, moderate to high negative genetic correlations (from -0.36 to -0.75) were estimated between the BR mobilization and accretion periods, suggesting that mechanisms driving BR mobilization and accretion processes were genetically correlated. This is the first study in ruminants that demonstrate that the extent and temporal changes in profiles of BR mobilization and accretion are heritable and genetically linked, indicating that such traits could be considered in genetic programs aimed at improving robustness. Nevertheless, further research is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of BR dynamics, notably by including other physiological parameters (i.e., metabolites and hormones) and additional information on the productive and reproductive life of the ewe. © The Author(s) 2018.

	abstract = {A goal for swine farming is the improvement in the number of live-born and weaned piglets per sow. Hence, the effect of parities should consider the correlation between the component traits of reproductive performance, weaning, and duration. Sows were housed in farrowing pens (W 2.2 × D 1.8 × H 1.2 m) on a partially slatted plastic floor. Twenty sows used in this study were between the first and sixth parity in gilts (P1), parity 2-5 (P3), and parity 6-9 (P6). Data collection by parity was classified into three categories: (1) reproduction performance (gestation length, total number of piglets born, number of piglets live born, number of piglets stillborn, total piglet birth weight; (2) weaning traits (weaning period, number of piglets weaning, total piglets weaning weight); (3) duration traits (farrowing duration, placenta expulsion duration, time from last piglet to first placenta, average birth interval, and tail wagging behavior). Gestation length was higher in P6 than P1 and P3 of different parity sows. The maximum value in P1 and P3 was 117 days, but the median value in P6 was 117 days (p < 0.05). The total number of piglets born (p = 0.113), number of piglets live born (p = 0.118), number of still piglets born (p = 0.151), and total piglet birth weight (p = 0.117) were not affected by parity. The number of live piglets was higher than the other parities by an average of 15.6 ± 2.1 in P1. The duration of farrowing was the lowest at 22.2 min in P6, but the maximum value was 42.2 min more than other parities (p = 0.355). Weaning traits of sows also did not differ significantly (p > 0.05), but the weaning period from P1 was lower than that of the other parities (p = 0.170). The number of piglets weaned was 10 heads on average in P1, P3, and P6 (p < 0.05). However, the mean values of the total piglet weaning weight (p = 0.377) of P6 (62.0 10.4 kg) were higher than those of P1 (54.9 10.2 kg) and P3 (58.4 13.6 kg). The placenta expulsion duration was higher in P6 than that in P1 and P3 (p = 0.447). The time from the last piglet to first placenta was be lower in P3 than that of the other parities (p = 0.206). The average birth interval was higher in P3 than that of the other parities (p = 0.156). Tail wagging (count) behavior was higher in P6 than in the other parities (p = 0.065). The data showed that the reproduction performance, total piglets born, and weight were higher in the gilts group, and higher in the weaning trait than that in the P6 group. This study examined the relationship between reproductive performance, birth interval and tail motion according to sow parity. Regarding duration, farrowing duration was lower in P6 than that in the other parities, but placenta expulsion and tail wagging were higher in P6 than in the other parities. Therefore, it is possible that the results from these sows could be used as basic data for effective farm management. Copyright © 2019 Korean Society of Animal Science and Technology.},

	abstract = {Andaman Local Goat (ALG) is an indigenous goat breed of Andaman and Nicobar islands. The present study was designed to characterize the ALG for its phenotypic characters, feeding and management system. Study revealed that these goats are medium to short in stature with colour combination of black, brown and white. Ears are flat and leaf-like, medium-sized and drooping. Both sexes have small horns, curved upward and backward. Flock size per family ranges from 5 to 35. Age at first mating, weight at first mating, age at first kidding, weight at first kidding, service period, kidding interval and gestation period were 260.0±15.0 days, 8.49±0.89 kg, 420.0±12.0 days, 13.26±1.61 kg, 101.20±11.23 days, 300.0±20.0 days and 147.0±2.0 days respectively. The common diseases observed were parasitic infestation, diarrhoea, bloat, grass poisoning, orf, and tetanus. The risk of extinction of the breed is increasing in these islands due to decrease in the number of breedable male and reduction in the total population. Efforts for conservation of this indigenous breed should be strengthened to save this breed from extinction. © 2019 Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sexual dimorphism in the Laysan albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) on Guadalupe Island was evaluated during the breeding seasons of 2015–2018 by measuring and comparing 10 morphological attributes: cranial length, bill length, nostril length, cranial width, bill height, bill width, tarsus length, closed wing length, opened wing length, and wingspan length in reproductive adults (n = 135). Males were larger than females across all traits (Student’s t-test, p < 0.05, p < 0.05). We created a logistic model using stepwise regression to predict sex based on morphological variables. This model indicated four significant morphological predictor variables (z < 0.05) and was able to successfully predict the sex of P. immutabilis individuals in more than 90% of the cases. Based on these predictor variables, a web app was developed to determine the sex of the Laysan albatross in the field, providing a non-invasive method for rapid data collection that reduces costs and handling times while improving conservation efforts. We tracked Laysan albatross (n = 36) during breeding seasons and found no significant differences between females and males for either trip length (GLMM, F = 0.017, DF = 1, 1, p = 0.917 > 0.05) or maximum trip distance (GLMM, F = 0.374, DF = 1, 1, p = 0.651 > 0.05). Our results suggest that both sexes show a strong preference to travel to highly productive coastal waters northeast of the breeding colony that are influenced by the California Current. The present research will serve to establish a baseline to protect this species on Guadalupe Island and highlights the importance of understanding sexual dimorphism in at-risk seabird species. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Advances in molecular genetics have allowed the identification of genes that can enhance livestock production. The aim of this study was to investigate possible relationships between the calpastatin (CAST) Hha1 gene polymorphisms and growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality in Awassi sheep. A total of 87 blood samples were collected from two-week-old Awassi ram lambs. The amplification of the CAST Hha1 gene yielded a fragment of 622 bp. Three CAST genotypes were found in Awassi sheep: MM for two fragments (385 bp and 281 bp), MN for three fragments (622 bp, 385 bp, and 281 bp), and NN for only one fragment (622 bp). The M and N allele frequencies of the CAST Hha1 genotypes were 0.765 and 0.235, respectively, while the genotypic frequencies of MM, MN, and NN were 0.586, 0.356, and 0.057, respectively. Based on CAST Hha1 gene polymorphisms, three groups of lambs (MM: N = 8; MN: N = 6; and NN: N = 3 genotypes) were subjected to a fattening period of 70 days to investigate growth performance and meat characteristics. Only the final body weight and longissimus muscle width were significantly different between the three genotypes, while no significant differences were detected in any other carcass characteristics and meat quality parameters. In this study, new variants were observed in CAST using the Hha1 restriction site, potentially assisting in Awassi sheep breeding and selection programs to improve final body weight and longissimus muscle width. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Infectious diseases have large economic impacts on the pig breeding industry worldwide. A few genetic markers associated to disease resistance have been recently identified and used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) in a few pig populations, as part of disease control programs. Neonatal Diarrhea (ND), Post-weaning Diarrhea (PWD), caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli, and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV), are diseases with high priority for the pig industry. Since interactions or antagonism between growth, innate immunity and disease resistance traits could exist, this work investigated if four disease resistance gene markers [mucin 4 (MUC4), rs338992994 associated with resistance to ND; fucosyltransferase 1 (FUT1), rs335979375 associated with resistance to PWD; and guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1), rs340943904 and rs80800372 (also known as WUR10000125) associated with resistance to PRRS] could affect seven production traits (average daily gain, back fat thickness, lean meat cuts, feed gain ratio, ham weight, visible intermuscular fat and ham weight loss at first salting) and 15 haematological parameters in about 550 performance tested Italian Large White pigs. We also monitored allele frequencies of the same markers on Italian Large White boars sampled under the national selection breeding program over a 20 years-period. Moreover, we evaluated allele frequencies of these polymorphisms in four Italian local pig breeds (Apulo-Calabrese, Casertana, Cinta Senese and Nero Siciliano). The frequency of the resistance-associated alleles for the four polymorphisms was usually higher in all local pig breeds, indirectly supporting a higher rusticity of autochthonous breeds, compared to commercial populations. The two GBP1 polymorphisms were not in complete linkage disequilibrium in all breeds, except in Apulo-Calabrese. No significant allele frequency change for the investigated markers occurred over 20 years in the Italian Large White boar population in three of these markers. Only FUT1 showed a modest but significant change of allele frequencies over this period. Association analyses carried out in Italian Large White pigs for production traits, meat quality or haematological parameters under investigation showed no significant effect of any genotyped polymorphisms. Our results indicate that implementing MAS programs in Italian Large White pigs with polymorphisms associated with disease resistance have no direct effects on production traits. The selection program running for this heavy pig breed might not negatively impact disease resistance derived by the investigated major genes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Targeted cell migration plays important roles in developmental biology and disease processes, including in metastasis. Drosophila tumors exhibit traits characteristic of human cancers, providing a powerful model to study developmental and cancer biology. We now find that cells derived from Drosophila eye-disc tumors also display organ-specific metastasis, invading receptive organs but not wing disc. Toll receptors are known to affect innate immunity and the tumor inflammatory microenvironment by modulating the NF-κB pathway. Our RNA interference (RNAi) screen and genetic analyses show that Toll-6 is required for migration and invasion of the tumor cells. Further, receptive organs express Toll ligands [Spätzle (Spz) family molecules], and ectopic Spz expression renders the wing disc receptive to metastasis. Finally, Toll-6 promotes metastasis by activating JNK signaling, a key regulator of cell migration. Hence, we report Toll-6 and Spz as a new pair of guidance molecules mediating organ-specific metastatic behavior and highlight a novel signaling mechanism for Toll-family receptors. © 2019.

	abstract = {We are in a period of relatively rapid climate change. This poses challenges for individual species and threatens the ecosystem services that humanity relies upon. Temperature is a key stressor. In a warming climate, individual organisms may be able to shift their thermal optima through phenotypic plasticity. However, such plasticity is unlikely to be sufficient over the coming centuries. Resilience to warming will also depend on how fast the distribution of traits that define a species can adapt through other methods, in particular through redistribution of the abundance of variants within the population and through genetic evolution. In this paper, we use a simple theoretical 'trait diffusion' model to explore how the resilience of a given species to climate change depends on the initial trait diversity (biodiversity), the trait diffusion rate (mutation rate), and the lifetime of the organism. We estimate theoretical dangerous rates of continuous global warming that would exceed the ability of a species to adapt through trait diffusion, and therefore lead to a collapse in the overall productivity of the species. As the rate of adaptation through intraspecies competition and genetic evolution decreases with species lifetime, we find critical rates of change that also depend fundamentally on lifetime. Dangerous rates of warming vary from 1°C per lifetime (at low trait diffusion rate) to 8°C per lifetime (at high trait diffusion rate). We conclude that rapid climate change is liable to favour short-lived organisms (e.g. microbes) rather than longer-lived organisms (e.g. trees).  © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Production performance of silkworm (Bombyx mori L., 1758) play a pivotal role in sericulture industry and good quality cocoon represents the economic driver of farms. Silkworms are monophagus insects and differences between cocoon characteristics may depend both on mulberry tree leaves quality as well as on genetic selection of hybrid lines. While a huge work was carried out to identify the best feeding sources to optimize yields, genetic types of silkworms with desirable production and economic traits were studied to a limited extent to date. This experimental feeding trial was carried out using a commercial variety of mulberry tree leaves (Morus alba var. Ichinose) to feed a total of 1600 silkworms in 4 replicates, allotted into 32 box consisting of 50 larvae each. Feed consumption, manure production and feed conversion ratios were monitored throughout the experimental period across five instars of 8 hybrid lines (200 larvae each). Efficiency, Profitability and Eco-compatibility were identified as criteria to evaluate the best performing hybrid lines: in descending order hybrids 32 × 31, 153 × 154 and 104 × 103 have appeared the best in terms of feed conversion ratio to larva weight gain and to cocoon weight, shell to cocoon ratio and wet manure per g of dry matter intake per silkworm. Our results point to promising outcomes as to animal selection to improve yields of silk production at farm level. Sustainable and modern sericulture industry can therefore point to raise genetically selected hybrid lines of silkworms together with opportune feeding practices, to optimize feed conversions and rationalize manure in farms. © 2019},

	abstract = {Background: Structural and functional alterations in cortical anatomy by environmental stressors are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders. Many of these changes are supposed to fore start disease onset and result from environmental exposures. It was previously demonstrated that black mustard extract had a significant impact on the structural and functional integrity of the prefrontal cortex in our previous study. Aim and Objectives: To report effects of the aqueous extract of Brassica nigra (BN) black mustard seeds on the cerebellum of adult Wistar rats at varying doses. Materials and Methods: Twenty adult female rats weighing an average of 180 ± 20g were used. They were split into 4 groups (n = 5) and received administration orally; Group A (received extract at 200 mg/kg body weight), Group B (received extract at 100 mg/kg body weight), Group C (received extract at 50 mg/kg body weight), and Group D (received distilled water ad libitum). Rats from the experimental groups (A-D) were sacrificed 24 hours after the last day of administration which took 28 days, and cerebellar tissues were subjected to routine histochemical and biochemical analyses. Results: Spectrophotometric analyses of glutathione enzymes (GPx, GSH, GST) revealed that BN exerted an inverse dose-related comparative reduction in their neural activities in rats. Cytoarchitectural disposition of neural cells and evaluated Nissl bodies confirmed that BN at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg dose initiated cell death within cerebellar sections of rat brains. Neurons in this brain region showed early signs of apoptosis, hallmarked by intercellular fragmentation, cytoplasmic shrinkage/ condensation and degradation of nuclear materials. Conclusion: Our results suggest that BN is not totally innocuous and thus, should be consumed in moderation. © Journal of Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences University.},

	abstract = {The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis can invade host cells, a virulence trait which may contribute to the persistence of infection at subgingival sites. Whilst the antibiotic protection assay has been commonly employed to investigate and quantify P. gingivalis invasion, data obtained have varied widely and a thorough investigation of the factors influencing this is lacking. We investigated the role of a number of bacterial and host-cell factors and report that the growth phase of P. gingivalis, source (laboratory strain vs. clinical strain), host-cell identity (cell line vs. primary), host-cell lysis method, and host-cell passage number had no significant effect on bacterial invasion. However, incubation time, host-cell seeding density, method of quantification (viable count vs. DNA), and whether host cells were plated or in suspension, were shown to influence invasion. Also, cells isolated by rapid adhesion to fibronectin exhibited higher levels of P. gingivalis invasion, possibly as a result of increased levels of active α5β1 integrin. Interestingly, this may represent a population of cells with stem cell-like properties. This study provides important new information by identifying the most important factors that influence P. gingivalis invasion assays and may help to explain variations in the levels previously reported. © 2018 Eur J Oral Sci},

	abstract = {Simple Summary: To maintain sustainability, the poultry production industry uses low-protein diets to minimize the potential for environmental pollution from nitrogen waste. However, reducing dietary crude protein may compromise the performance and health of the chickens. Thus, strategies using crystalline amino acids or exogenous protease added to the low-protein diets, the latter being the more recent trend, have been common practice in the industry, in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for poultry meat in the most sustainable way possible. In the present study, we evaluated a novel protease, produced by the bacterial species Bacillus clausii isolated from the body fluid of a polychaete (Periserrula leucophryna) found only in Korean waters, as an additive in broiler chickens fed the low-protein diets. We found that dietary protease improved growth performance in these broiler chickens. Abstract: Dietary exogenous proteases (ENZ) can be used in poultry production to improve the growth of chickens fed low-protein (LP) diets. We hypothesized that ENZ supplemented in an LP diet would improve growth performance and physiological response in broilers for 8–35 days. To investigate this, we used a 2 × 2 factorial design with crude protein (CP, normal diet (NP) and LP) and ENZ. The LP diet contained low in 1% CP and ca. 8–12% amino acids compared to the NP diet and both NP and LP diets were added without or with (1 g/kg of diet) ENZ. We randomly allocated 720 1-week-old Ross 308 male chicks to 48 pens and experimental diets. At 21 days, dietary ENZ, but not CP, increased (p = 0.007) live body weight. Body weight gain from 8–21 days was affected (p = 0.006) by dietary ENZ, but was not affected (p = 0.210) by CP. The feed conversion ratio was affected by both CP and ENZ during the starter period (p < 0.05), by ENZ (p = 0.034) during the finisher period, and by CP (p < 0.001) during the whole period. However, the interaction between CP and ENZ did not significantly affect growth performance (p > 0.05). Dietary ENZ increased (p = 0.013) the relative weight of liver at 21 days. CP and ENZ affected (p = 0.043) total short-chain fatty acids at 21 days. However, this effect was not seen (p = 0.888) at 35 days. Dietary CP increased (p < 0.05) the serum concentrations of both uric acid and creatinine in broilers. We concluded that dietary ENZ is more beneficial to younger broilers, independent of CP levels, and that its effect was restricted to body weight and the feed conversion ratio. © 2019 by the authors.

The present study focuses mainly on the application of the three approaches (FGs, MFGs, MBFGs) for morpho-functional classifications used for detecting changes in phytoplankton communities in five Bulgarian large reservoirs that have long been used for aquaculture. Totally 113 taxa of planktonic algae were identifi ed. The representatives of Cyanoprokaryota (H1, M; 5a, 5b, 5e; III, VII), Chlorophyta (J; 3b, 9b; IV), Streptophyta (P, N; 8a; IV) and Bacillariophyceae (P, MP, D; 6b; VI) had the largest contribution to the abundance of algae in the studied reservoirs. Fourty-two dominant species from eighteen functional groups (FGs), fi fteen morpho-functional groups (MFGs) and seven morphologically based functional groups (MBFGs) were found. The functional groups with most species were: H1, J, N, Lo, P и M, most common among MFGs were: 5a, 5b, 5e, 6b, 8a and 9b, and among MBFGs: III, IV, VI and VII. The large gelatinous colonial (M; 5b; VII) and filamentous (H1; 5a, 5e, III) cyanoprokaryotes, some of which are potentially toxic species indicative of eutrophication, were among the most common taxa in three of the studied reservoirs. According to the presented study, the three morpho-functional environmental concepts provide an important tool for understanding the seasonal changes in phytoplankton communities, as well as for assessing the environmental status of heavily modifi ed freshwater reservoirs. © 2019, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

	abstract = {The fast and accurate identification of forest species is fundamental to support their conservation, sustainable management, and, more specifically, the fight against illegal logging. Traditionally, identifications are done by using dichotomous or polytomous keys based on physical characteristics of trees. However, these techniques are of little use when the trees have been cut, removed from their natural environment, and consequently there is only a partial subset of information on all those traits. In these cases, it may be possible to resort to the anatomical characteristics of the wood, which are less affected by environmental factors and therefore have a high diagnostic value in the identification. For some years now, computers have been used to support the identification processes through interactive keys and access to global repositories of digital images, among others. However, techniques based on machine learning have recently been developed and applied successfully to the identification of both plant and animal species. Consequently, automatic or semiautomatic techniques have been proposed to support botanists, taxonomists and non-experts in the species identification process. This article presents an overview of the use of these techniques as well as the current challenges and opportunities for the identification of forest species based on xylotheque samples. © 2018 IEEE.},

Pinto peanut (Arachis pintoi Krap. and Greg. “Amarillo”) has several traits that are suitable for mixed pastures but have not yet been adequately explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate a mixture of Tifton 85 bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) and pinto peanut and evaluate forage yield, crude protein, and stocking density. A two-year study of three grazing systems was used with the following treatment combinations: (a) Tifton 85 (T) + 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1 + pinto peanut (T + PP+100); (b) T + 100 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (T + 100; control, pure grass); and (c) T + 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1 (T + 200; positive control, pure grass). In this study, forage yield, pasture characteristics and responses of lactating cows were evaluated. The experimental design was completely randomized with three treatments (grazing systems), three replicates (paddocks), and repeated measures (grazing cycles within seasons). Forage accumulation, crude protein concentration, and stocking rate were 15.1; 11.3 and 14.1 t DM ha-1 yr-1; 17%, 16%, and 17%; and 5.3; 4.9 and 6.1 AU ha-1 day-1, respectively.

Fasciola appeared widespread from the east to the west of Algeria. Among 1701 sampled cattle from 8 Algerian provinces, 5% were infected. Using morphological and morphometric analysis, one morphotype of Fasciola was observed. Nuclear ITS marker indicated that all collected flukes belong to F. hepatica. Multiple alignments of ITS dataset revealed two haplotypes, one described here for the first time. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of mitochondrial markers revealed weak population structure in Algeria. Mismatch distributions, neutrality tests, and median-joining network analysis all were compatible with a recent expansion of Algerian F. hepatica population. Fasciolosis appeared common in Algerian cattle, it seems that the absence of control strategy coupled to the favorable Mediterranean climate may lead to a reconstruction and dispersion of its populations. This study provides important results concerning the genetic characterization and variability of F. hepatica in Algeria as well as the significant role of cattle importation in shaping its dispersal route worldwide. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Pharmacologically-active components in honey such as flavonoids and phenolic constituents are known to contribute to its medicinal benefits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on evaluating anticancer effects of locally-produced Malaysian stingless bee honey from Heterotrigona itama sp. on malignant glioma cells. Methods: Proliferation and apoptosis studies of U-87 MG cells following stingless bee honey treatment were carried out using MTS assay and acridine orange/propidium iodide dual staining, respectively. Results: Results demonstrated time and dose-dependent cytotoxicity using 0.625%, 1.25% and 10% stingless bee honey (P < 0.05). IC50 values were calculated using cells treated with 10% stingless bee honey. It was also observed that 10% stingless bee honey induced nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation and nucleus fragmentation, indicating that cellular changes were consistent with the apoptotic characteristics of the cells. Conclusion: These data provide a good basis for further evaluation of the medicinal properties of stingless bee honey from Heterotrigona itama sp.

	abstract = {Many plant species of tropical African origin have substantial socio-economic and cultural importance among the rural populace. A good number of these species exhibit long-term ethno-medicinal relevance to the African people. Besides, they have major food and nutritional values that have guaranteed some levels of food and nutritional security. Species considered in this review have shown considerable diversity in many traits including those that are economically significant. Prospects for selection for genetic improvement therefore exist with profound implications on household and rural economies. In this review, the following tropical plant species were discussed: African breadfruit (Treculia africana Decne), African Walnut (Plukenetia conophora Muell Arg.), Tamarind (Tamarindus indica L.), baobab (Adansonia digitata L.), shea butter tree (Vitellaria paradoxa C. F. Gaertn.), bitter leaf (Vernonia amygdalina L.) and ‘Utazi’ (Gongronema latifolium). Certain facts have emerged from the review that tend to fault the neglect of these species by the international research community and thus, makes a call for research attention compelling. Relevant current literature studies especially those published by sub-Saharan African scientists in areas of interest were reviewed. Also consulted were research outputs from elsewhere in related fields including pharmacy and veterinary medicine. These indigenous species therefore merit more serious research attention due to their food, nutritional, health and economic significance to concerned African populations who continue to exploit them for these purposes. Besides their value for biodiversity conservation they, unlike the exotic species, have no problems with adaptation to the environment and familiarity with the local inhabitants. © CAB International 2019 (Online ISSN 1749-8848)},

Currently nothing is known about the genetic variability and population structure of Cystoisospora suis (Apicomplexa: Coccidia), the causative agent of piglet coccidiosis, and we made use of the recently available genome of C. suis (strain Wien-I) to amplify microsatellite regions (ca. 300-550 bp) and evaluate the applicability of fluorescence-labeled primers to investigate amplicon length variation at high resolution using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Two phenotypically characterized isolates (Wien-I, toltrazuril susceptible; Holl 1 toltrazuril resistant) and six field isolates from Europe were compared by conventional PCR followed by agar-gel electrophoresis, Sanger sequencing, and CE (fluorescence labeling and fragment length analysis) to evaluate the applicability of the method. Four primer pairs could be identified that amplified bands of the expected size and were labeled for CE analysis. High resolution CE for size determination of PCR amplicons proved to be a reliable and simple method. It revealed high diversity of the analyzed strains, with marked differences even between two strains from neighboring swine farms. In follow-up studies, adaptation of the PCR assay to multiplexing and amplification of small DNA quantities will provide a cost-effective tool to analyse field strains to reveal geographic diversity that could be mapped to phenotypic traits. © 2019 Joachim, Ruttkowski and Palmieri.},

	abstract = {The use of species distribution models (SDM) is of increasing popularity when studying biological invasions, e.g. to assess the impact of climate change on invasive species, to prioritize conservation measures, or to study invasive evolutionary biology. SDM correlate known occurrences of species with environmental variables and predict a species’ potential distribution on other geographies over space and time. Today, SDM are widely used to produce invasion risk maps by delineating probable risk areas based on climatic suitability for a species. These maps can guide early detection and rapid response measures. While recent developments in modelling approaches and wider availability of environment datasets have helped to create better and more accurate SDM, in many cases the used models ignore the associated underlying ecological processes for e.g. dispersal and biotic interactions and thus provide only an incomplete picture of invasion risks. In this paper, we present a review of the most common applications of SDM in invasive species management and provide an overview of possible solutions to various challenges like uncertainty and transferability associated with them. Based on our review we conclude that ways towards more accurate model outputs include fitting models with existing ecological knowledge (hybrid models), address uncertainty and biotic interactions and link species dispersal traits with projections of species distributions. In the future, work is required on developing more hybrid approaches and models that addresses both local diffusion and long distance movement of alien species. © CAB International 2019.},

This requires when selecting genetic resources for our breeding program, the study of seed productivity and structural yield components to be made in relation to the duration of the vegetation period. With such aim twenty-eight cultivars of different maturity groups were studied during three year in a field trial conducted in the long-plot design method on the soybean technology established for the country. According to the results presented, a high and stable performance regarding the traits determining the seed productivity could be considered in connection with the maturity group of genotypes. In selection for “large-seedness” as parental components should be used genotypes with high expression of the trait from the early-ripening or middle late-ripening group of maturity. The average values, but also the ecological dispersion of the traits number of fertile nodes and number of branches were higher in genotypes with a longer vegetation period, and also early-ripening genotypes with a high and ecologically stable expression on these traits were established in this study. Individual productivity, estimated by the number and mass of seeds obtained from a plant, has the most stable performance in Bulgarian cultivars and can be considered to be a function of the specific adaptation of genotypes. Also there is a trend for a higher yield of seed from a plant in genotypes with shorter growth period which can be associated with better seed filling. © 2019, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

	abstract = {In plants, aquaporins (AQP) occur in multiple isoforms in both plasmalemma and tonoplast membranes resulting in regulation of water flow in and out of cells, and ultimately, water transfer through a series of cells in leaves and roots. Consequently, it is not surprising that physiological and molecular studies have identified AQPs as playing key roles in regulating hydraulic conductance in roots and leaves. As a result, the activity of AQPs influences a range of physiological processes including phloem loading, xylem water exit, stomatal aperture and gas exchange. The influence of AQPs on hydraulic conductance in plants is particularly important in regulating plant transpiration rate, particularly under conditions of developing soil water-deficit stress and elevated atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD). In this review, we examine the impact of AQP activity and hydraulic conductance on crop water use and the identification of genotypes that express soil water conservation as a result of these traits. An important outcome of this research has been the identification and commercialization of cultivars of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and soybean (Glycine max (Merr) L.) for dry land production systems. © 2018 by the authors.

The variant strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has been greatly neglected for more than 30 years. Recently, the subclinical infection of suspected IBD, causing considerable economic losses, occurred in the main chicken-farming regions of China. Through RT-PCR, sequencing, and phylogenic analyses, novel variant IBDVs were first identified in six provinces of eastern China. Immunological detection further confirmed the antigenic variation of the Chinese variant IBDVs. The Chinese IBDV variants were obviously different from the American IBDV variants, with less than a 97.7% (VP1) or 98.7% (VP2) amino acid sequence identity. Animal experiments further confirmed the serious threat of the variant IBDVs to chickens, demonstrating irreversible damage to the central immune organ, obvious immunosuppression, and growth retardation. This study not only identified the pandemic nature of the novel variant IBDVs for the first time but also discovered the distinct molecular epidemiological characteristics of these viruses, which will contribute more to the control of the disease. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Features of intensive farming can seriously threaten pig homeostasis, well-being and productivity. Disease tolerance of an organism is the adaptive ability in preserving homeostasis and at the same time limiting the detrimental impact that infection can inflict on its health and performance without affecting pathogen burden per se. While disease resistance (DRs) can be assessed measuring appropriately the pathogen burden within the host, the tolerance cannot be quantified easily. Indeed, it requires the assessment of the changes in performance as well as the changes in pathogen burden. In this paper, special attention is given to criteria required to standardize methodologies for assessing disease tolerance (DT) in respect of infectious diseases in pigs. The concept is applied to different areas of expertise and specific examples are given. The basic physiological mechanisms of DT are reviewed. Disease tolerance pathways, genetics of the tolerance-related traits, stress and disease tolerance, and role of metabolic stress in DT are described. In addition, methodologies based on monitoring of growth and reproductive performance, welfare, emotional affective states, sickness behavior for assessment of disease tolerance, and methodologies based on the relationship between environmental challenges and disease tolerance are considered. Automated Precision Livestock Farming technologies available for monitoring performance, health and welfare-related measures in pig farms, and their limitations regarding DT in pigs are also presented. Since defining standardized methodologies for assessing DT is a serious challenge for biologists, animal scientists and veterinarians, this work should contribute to improvement of health, welfare and production in pigs. © 2019 Nakov, Hristov, Stankovic, Pol, Dimitrov, Ilieski, Mormede, Hervé, Terenina, Lieubeau, Papanastasiou, Bartzanas, Norton, Piette, Tullo and van Dixhoorn.},

	abstract = {Given the impact of climate issues and their direct influence on agricultural production, the aim of this study was to identify superior genotypes of dry edible common bean under water deficit. Thus, 30 common bean genotypes were evaluated under controlled greenhouse conditions in a randomized block experimental design with split plots and four replications; the plots consisted of the water treatments (irrigated and water deficit) and the split plots consisted of the genotypes. The results showed genetic variability among the accessions evaluated, and in spite of significant reduction in grain yield and stomatal conductance under water deficit, these two traits showed significant, positive correlation and are able to be applied in early selection of genotypes under this stress condition. Another important response was in relation to the genotypes SER-16, SEN 92, FT Paulistinha, Carioca Precoce, IAC Imperador, and SXB 410, which showed the best yield performances in the two water treatments applied. They can be widely used in breeding programs for development of new cultivars, especially aiming at drought tolerance. © 2019, Federal University of Lavras. All rights reserved.},

Apparent organ lesions documented during meat inspection may provide an opportunity to integrate phenotypes into the breeding program. Nevertheless, several factors influence the scoring of organ lesions causing intra-abattoir and inter-abattoir variations in the estimated prevalence. The utilization of recorded lesions as health-related phenotypes depends on a precise and uniform lesion definition and standardized data recording but these conditions are currently not sufficiently met in meat inspection data. Meat inspector training is often quoted as producing a sensitivity-increasing approach in the literature, and statistical approaches such as data scaling or latent-class models might handle this systematic abattoir effect. However, initial heritabilities have been estimated to demonstrate the potential of meat inspection data. Improving pig health via breeding by using this data currently requires further efforts but seems to be a valuable method for the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Consumers associate product quality more and more with the extrinsic cues related to the way animals are raised (animal welfare), agrobiodiversity, and tradition. Consumers also favor the reduced use of additives in products. To support the preservation of the autochthonous pig breeds, which are used marginally due to their lower productivity, it is important to enhance the market potential and value of their products. In light of consumer preferences for organic farming and product naturalness, the present study was designed to develop a nitrite-free product (salami type of dry-fermented sausage) from Krškopolje pigs (autochthonous Slovenian breed) and to evaluate if and how the husbandry system (organic or conventional) affects its quality. Results of this study demonstrated softer texture and somewhat less tasty dry-fermented sausages from pigs that were held in organic husbandry. This result could be ascribed to more unsaturated fat and the fact that sausages were produced without additives with antioxidant capacity. Dry-fermented sausages were produced in a traditional way, without addition of nitrites and starter cultures, from meat of an autochthonous breed (Krškopolje pig) raised either in a conventional indoor or organic husbandry system. Physicochemical and sensory analyses were performed at the end of processing to characterize their quality. Dry-fermented sausages from organic pork retained more moisture, which resulted in higher water activity and softer texture (instrumental and sensory). They were more oxidized (higher thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)), in agreement with more unsaturated fatty acid profile, a higher score for rancid taste, and a higher relative abundance of volatiles from lipid β-oxidation. Overall, dry-fermented sausages from organic pork had lower levels of volatile compounds, particularly, those originating from spices (despite the same quantity added) and lower levels of amino-acid degradation. Sensory analysis showed that dry-fermented sausages from organic pork had less intensive and vivid color, tasted more bitter and sour, and had more off-tastes. The observed differences could be related to initial differences in raw material (differences in meat pH and level of polyunsaturated fatty acids) affecting the process of fermentation. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Multiple births or twinning in equids are dangerous, undesirable situations that compromise the life of the dam and resulting offspring. However, embryo vitrification and freezing techniques take advantage of individuals whose multiple ovulations allow flushing more fertilised embryos from the oviduct to be collected, increasing the productivity and profitability of reproductive techniques. Embryo preservation is especially important in highly endangered populations such as certain donkey (Equus asinus) breeds; for which conventional reproductive techniques have previously been deemed inefficient. For instance, becoming an effective alternative to artificial insemination with frozen semen to preserve the individuals' genetic material. The objective of this study was to examine the historical foaling records of Andalusian donkeys to estimate prevalence, risk factors, phenotypic and genetic parameters for multiple births, assessing the cumulative foal number born per animal, maximum foal number per birth and multiple birth number per animal. We designed a Bayesian General Animal Mixed Model with single records considering the ‘fixed’ effects of birth year, birth season, birth month, sex, farm, location, and husbandry system. Age was considered and included as a linear and quadratic covariate. Gibbs sampling reported heritability estimates ranging from 0.18 ± 0.101 to 0.24 ± 0.078. Genetic and phenotypic correlations ranged from 0.496 ± 0.298 to 0.846 ± 0.152 and 0.206 ± 0.063 to 0.607 ± 0.054, respectively.

	abstract = {Domestic chicken populations have been subjected to selection strategies to improve different production traits. Throughout history, selection coupled with diverse demographic dynamics have shaped the genome of many local populations which might harbor important genetic combinations with potential for production and survival to future unknown climate changes. South American local chickens include several well-adapted local breeds that thrive in extreme environments (e.g., tropical rain forest, high altitude and desert). In addition, there has been a long tradition of game fowl breeding in South America about which very little is known. As game fowl display distinct phenotypes compared to other types of chickens, i.e., aggressiveness, we have screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) localized in genes related to behavior that depart from neutrality (i.e., outliers) and therefore might be influenced by selection. Here we used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) to identify 122,801 SNPs distributed across the genome to scan for selection signatures in South American chicken populations. We detected 892 SNPs that were under selection. Two SNPs under positive selection localized in a genomic region harboring the Dopamine Receptor 2 (DRD2) gene and the Ankyrin Repeat and Kinase Domain Containing 1 (ANKK1) gene which have been associated with behavior. The population branch statistics analysis (PBS) on these two SNPs provided further evidence that these two variants have been under positive selection in game fowl. These findings contribute to the understanding of the genetic architecture behind the aggressiveness behavior in chickens, a trait of paramount importance in the poultry industry. © 2019},

	abstract = {Tendon refers to a band of tough, regularly arranged, and connective tissue connecting muscle and bone, transferring strength from muscle to bone, and enabling articular stability and movement. The limitations of natural tendon grafts motivate the scaffold-based tissue engineering (TE) approaches, which aim to build patient-specific biological substitutes that can repair the damaged or diseased tissues. Advances in engineering and knowledge of chemistry and biology have brought forth numerous fibre-based technologies, including electrospinning, electrohydrodynamic jet printing, electrochemical alignment technique, and other fibre-assembly technologies, which enable the fabrication of tendon tissue structure in 3-dimension. Textile techniques such as knitting and braiding have also been performed based on the fibrous materials to produce more complex structure. These scaffolds showed great similarity with native tendons in architectural features, mechanical properties, and facilitate biological functionality such as cellular adhesion, ingrowth, proliferation, and differentiation towards tendon tissue. Herein, we review the techniques that have been used to assemble fibres into scaffolds for tendon TE application. The morphological structures, mechanical properties, materials, degradation characteristics, and biological activities of the induced scaffolds were compared. The existing challenges and future prospects of fibre-based tendon TE have also been discussed. Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is a vector of many medically significant viruses in the Americas, including dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus. Traits such as longevity, fecundity, and feeding behavior contribute to the ability of Ae. aegypti to serve as a vector of these pathogens. Both local environmental factors and population genetics could contribute to variability in these traits. We performed a comparative study of Ae. aegypti populations from four geographically and environmentally distinct collection sites in Argentina in which the cohorts from each population were held at temperature values simulating a daily cycle, with an average of 25°C in order to identify the influence of population on life-history traits. In addition, we performed the study of the same populations held at a daily temperature cycle similar to that of the surveyed areas. According to the results, Aguaray is the most outstanding population, showing features that are important to achieve high fitness. Whereas La Plata gathers features consistent with low fitness. Iguazu was outstanding in blood-feeding rate while Posadas's population showed intermediate values. Our results also demonstrate that climate change could differentially affect unique populations, and that these differences have implications for the capacity for Ae. aegypti to act as vectors for medically important arboviruses.  © 2018 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Aim: Broilers' optimum performance in response to their genetic potential depends on litter environment which is ideal for bacterial survival and coccidian oocyst sporulation. An in vitro evaluation was conducted for the effectiveness of superphosphate, meta-bisulfide, and charcoal litter amendments in minimizing Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium survival, Eimeria oocyst count, and sporulation. Materials and Methods: Three groups of 16 litter trays were prepared and inoculated with E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and Eimeria non-sporulated oocyst. A set of four trays in each group was designed for each one of the chemical amendments. A total of 720 litter samples were collected and examined for bacterial counts, Eimeria oocyst count, and sporulation during the experimental period (35 days). Results: Litter moisture and pH revealed a highly significant (p < 0.001) reduction in all treated litter trays compared to control. Total bacterial count (TBC), total Enterobacteriaceae count, and S. Typhimurium count showed a highly significant (p < 0.001) reduction in meta-bisulfide-treated trays compared to other amendments and positive control. Meanwhile, Eimeria oocyst count and sporulation revealed a highly significant (p < 0.001) reduction in superphosphate, meta-bisulfide, and charcoal-treated trays, respectively. Temperature revealed a highly significant (p < 0.001) weak positive correlation with pH of all inoculated trays, a highly significant (p < 0.001) weak negative correlation with moisture percentage of E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium inoculated trays, and a highly significant (p < 0.001) weak negative correlation with TBC. Meanwhile, relative humidity revealed significant (p=0.005) weak positive correlation with moisture percentage of E. coli O157:H7 inoculated trays. Conclusion: The study concluded that regular usage with periodical reapplication of litter amendments as meta-bisulfide or superphosphate in poultry farms is one of the indispensable managemental and preventive measures for minimizing bacterial survival and inhibiting Eimeria oocyst maturation and sporulation. © Soliman, et al.},

	abstract = {                             Introduction/Objective The development of safer cosmetic medical procedures has lead to an increase in the number of minimally invasive esthetic procedures. The main aim of the current paper is to examine the connection of the number/location of esthetic procedures with the overall body image dissatisfaction, affective temperament traits, and the index of self-esteem in persons who have undergone several minimally invasive cosmetic procedures for esthetic reasons. The subsidiary aim is to compare the predominance of the above-mentioned traits in the sample with the results in the general population. Methods The study included 228 participants, aged from 21 to 73 years, who had multiple minimally invasive cosmetic procedures, purely for esthetic reasons. Data were collected using a socio-demographic questionnaire, medical documentation, the Body Image Assessment Scale-Body Dimensions, TEMPS-A temperament scale, and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results Overall body image dissatisfaction was moderate in our patients (11.56 ± 11.877). With an increase of dissatisfaction, the number of procedures did not grow (r = 0.075, p = 0.263); however, the number of body parts on which the procedures had been performed did. The patients who had their body parts altered most were found to have deeper dissatisfaction with their overall body image (F(2,225) = 4.963, p = 0.008, η                             2                              = 0.04), and the most prominent temperament was wound to be hyper-thymic (F(2,225) = 3.408, p = 0.035, η                             2                              = 0.03), similar to the Serbian general population. Conclusion Through establishing potential relations between physical, social, and psychological variables, like body image dissatisfaction, temperament, and self-esteem, we could provide a better insight into a mental state of individuals who frequently undergo minimally invasive cosmetic procedures.                          © 2019, Serbia Medical Society.

The project has greatly accelerated the identification of deleterious mutations for a range of genetic diseases, as well as for embryonic lethals. The rate of identification of causal mutations for complex traits has been slower, reflecting the typically small effect size of these mutations and the fact that many are likely in as-yet-unannotated regulatory regions. Both the deleterious mutations that have been identified and the mutations associated with complex trait variation have been included in low-cost SNP array designs, and these arrays are being genotyped in tens of thousands of dairy and beef cattle, enabling management of deleterious mutations in these populations as well as genomic selection.

	abstract = {Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is an enzyme that participates in important cellular mechanisms as aldehyde detoxification and retinoic acid synthesis; moreover, ALDH activity is involved in drug resistance, a characteristic of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Even though ALDH is found in stem cells, CSCs and progenitor cells, this enzyme has been successfully used to identify and isolate cell populations with CSC properties from several tumor origins. ALDH is allegedly involved in cell differentiation through its product, retinoic acid. However, direct or indirect ALDH inhibition, using specific inhibitors or retinoic acid, has shown a reduction in ALDH activity, along with the loss of stem cell traits, reduction of cell proliferation, invasion, and drug sensitization. For these reasons, ALDH and retinoic acid are promising therapeutic targets. This review summarizes the current evidence for ALDH as a CSCs marker in solid tumors, as well as current knowledge about the functional roles of ALDH in CSCs. We discuss the controversy of ALDH activity to maintain CSC stemness, or conversely, to promote cell differentiation. Finally, we review the advances in using ALDH inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.},

A meta-analysis of 42 studies was carried out with 518 heterosis estimates. In total, 62.5% of estimates were found to be significantly different from zero, the majority of which (89.8%) were beneficial for the studied trait. Trait and breed combination were shown to have a significant effect on the size of heterosis (P < 0.001 and P = 0.044, respectively). However, climate did not have a significant effect. Health, longevity, and milk production traits showed the highest heterosis (31.84 ± 10.73%, 35.13 ± 14.35%, and 35.15 ± 3.29%, respectively), whereas fertility, growth, and maternal traits showed moderate heterosis (12.02 ± 4.10%, 12.25 ± 2.69%, and 15.69 ± 3.26%, respectively). Crosses between breeds from different types showed moderate to high heterosis ranging from 9.95 ± 4.53% to 19.53 ± 3.62%, whereas crosses between breeds from the same type did not express heterosis that was significantly different from zero.

	abstract = {A revised two-dimensional ecosystem model of 35 state variables, set within the De Soto Canyon ecotone of the Northern Gulf of Mexico and driven by both three-dimensional flow fields from uncoupled circulation models and observed accumulations of zooplankton herbivores, is explored here in terms of the daily (1) food web, (2) public health, and (3) sedimentary consequences of oil-, nutrient-, and overfishing-induced transitions of dominant particle transports to the seafloor: from changing vectors of copepod fecal pellets to those of bacterial-modulated marine snow formations and lysed harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxicities over the annual periods of 1965-2011. Recently spilled petrochemicals were found to minimally impact already decimated zooplankton populations. They facilitated instead formation of marine snow macroaggregates. These recent oil effects just exacerbated other consequences of prior overfishing in the absence of major eutrophication along the eastern side of the ecotone on the WFS (West Florida Shelf). East of that ecotone, overly optimistic removals of piscivore fish stocks over the last half century had already caused a trophic cascade, with ~95% of WFS marine pelagic herbivore losses occurring by 2010, before the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) blowout. By contrast, west of De Soto Canyon, copepods on the eutrophic Louisiana shelf were less impacted by overfishing. Yet during simulated descent of modeled marine snow to the ~1200 m isobath of the upper slope, ~90% of the particulate import to the benthos was now mainly clay minerals of Mississippi River origin along the ecotone, scavenged by aggregates from the water column. The model results here replicated concurrent time series of: (1) annual sediment accumulations, measured at the seafloor; (2) bimonthly onshore supplies of shipboard and current-meter sampled in situ nutrient fluxes, due to upwelling forced remotely by the Loop Current; and (3) near-surface weekly phytoplankton changes of competing functional groups of microalgae, seen by satellite and cell counts. Because of such minimal grazing stresses, after the most recent DWH oil reductions to ~50% of the remaining WFS copepods, their decreased herbivory amounted to only an 8% fecal pellet contribution to computed particle fluxes, settling to the model’s sea bottom. By contrast, 12% of the biotic particle exports, entrained within marine snow, resulted from increased allocthonous loadings of Mississippi River nutrients, while 50% of the ungrazed sinking phytoplankton were fueled by decadal anomalies of increased nutrient supplies from upwelling by the Loop Current. Finally, of the exiting marine snow phytodetritus from the 2010 to 2011 water columns, 30% were due to autocthonous nutrients of the slope water column. Yet, in contrast to the summer-fall oligotrophic HAB accumulations of as much as ~150 umol C L-1 of Karenia brevis, the other eutrophic, sunlit dinoflagellate competitor Cochlodinum sp. behaved instead like the diatom Skeletonema costatum but with winter model blooms of just 3-5 umol C L-1 of this second dinoflagellate simulated by January 2002 and 2011. Moreover, both these simulated and observed stocks of Cochlodinum sp. during 2010-11 on the WFS were ~fivefold less than those found in the adjacent estuaries during March 2011. Such model results indicated that (4) this eutrophic dinoflagellate, with twofold greater required half-saturation constants for phosphorus uptake, was indeed a poor competitor on the WFS against K. brevis, adapted instead there for oligotrophic habitats; and (5) the WFS had not yet been eutrophied, seaward of the mouths of the estuaries, despite popular convictions among some proponents of increased nutrient loadings to Florida’s coastal waters. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Aiming to explore the effect of reasonable reed type rice acreage on the purification of culture water of crab pond, we analyzed the characteristics of phytoplankton functional group community and their relationship with environmental factors. From July to October, 2015, the species composition, biological density, biomass, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou evenness index, and Margalef richness index of phytoplankton and their relationship with environmental factors were analyzed. The results showed that a total of 126 phytoplankton species were identified, and most of them belonged to Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta and Cyanobacteria, being classified into 71 genera and eight phyla. Simultaneously, 16 dominant species were classed into 12 functional groups of R, S1, G, J, B, D, P, LO, WO, X2, X1 and MP. The ranges of average biological density, average biomass, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou evenness index and Margalef richness index were 0-(8.135±4.794)×107 L－1, (1.079±0.454)-(38.162±13.414) mg/L, (1.301±0.072)-(2.387±0.368), (0.346±0.006)-(0.843±0.125), (1.038±0.183)-(1.852±0.131), respectively. The redundancy analysis (RDA) result showed that the most important factors affecting the structure of phytoplankton functional groups were nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, temperature, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll a. The water pollution level of young carb pond was α-fouling. The comparative analysis of phytoplankton diversity in the young crab pond with different reed type rice acreages showed that the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou evenness index of the phytoplankton in the 20% group were all higher than those in the other three groups and were relatively stable; however, the richness index of the phytoplankton in the 20% group was higher than the other three groups in the mid-term, and lower than 0% and 10% groups in the late-term, but higher than 30% group. In conclusion, the crab pond with reed type rice of 20% area is more appropriate. © 2019 Zhejiang University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Most biological structures carry out multiple functions. Focusing on only one function to make adaptive inferences overlooks that manifold selection pressures and tradeoffs shape the characteristics of a multifunctional structure. Focusing on single functions can only lead to a partial picture of the causes underlying diversity and the evolutionary origin of the structure in question. I illustrate this discussion using bark as a study case. Bark comprises all the tissues surrounding the xylem in woody plants. Broadly, bark includes an inner and mostly living region and an outer, dead one. Of all plant structures, bark has the most complex anatomical structure and ontogenetic origin involving two (and often three) different meristems. Traditionally, the wide diversity in bark traits, mainly bark thickness, has been interpreted as the result of the selective pressures imposed by fire regime. However, recent research has shown that explanations based on fire regime cannot account for salient patterns of bark variation globally including the very strong inner bark thickness-stem diameter scaling, which is likely due to metabolic needs, and the very high intracommunity variation in total, inner, and outer bark thickness, and in inner:outer proportions. Moreover, explanations based on fire disregard that in addition to fire protection, bark carries out several other crucial functions for plants including translocation of photosynthates; storage of starch, soluble sugars, water, and other compounds; protection from herbivores, pathogens, and high temperatures; wound closure, as well as mechanical support, photosynthesis, and likely being involved in xylem embolism repair. All these functions are crucial for plant performance and are involved in synergistic (e.g., storage of water and insulation) and trade-off relationships (e.g., protection from fire vs photosynthetic activity). Focusing on only one of these functions, protection from fire has provided an incomplete picture of the selective forces shaping bark diversity and has severely hindered our incipient understanding of the functional ecology of this crucial region of woody stems. Applying a multifunctional perspective to the study of bark will allow us to address why we observe such high intracommunity variation in bark traits, why some bark trait combinations are ontogenetically impossible or penalized by selection, how bark is coordinated functionally with other plant parts, and as a result, to understand how bark contributes to the vast diversity of plant ecological strategies across the globe. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

There were 41 consecutive patients with intracranial meningiomas surgically treated at the Department of Neurosurgery, Zenica Cantonal Hospital, Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, during the period from January 2010 to December 2015. We reviewed clinical data including patient age, gender, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of the tumor and peritumoral edema, tumor margins, intraoperative characteristics, histopathologic grade and Ki67 LI. In all cases, follow up MRI was obtained at about three months after resection and PTBE was analyzed. Our research showed the tumor volume, tumor margins, and intraoperative signs of arachnoidal and pial invasion to be associated with PTBE in intracranial meningiomas. Ki67 LI expression correlated with PTBE. This study showed the resolution of PTBE to depend on invasive behavior of meningioma and KI67 LI.

	abstract = {Progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) is a main cause of its morbidity and mortality. CRC progression is characterized by increased growth of the primary carcinoma as well as lymphatic and haematogenic spread. The liver is the first vascular bed in which disseminating colorectal cancer cells are often trapped and subsequent liver metastasis is commonly the cause of death. The microenvironment of primary or circulating and disseminated tumor cells seems to be essential in all steps of the metastatic process of CRC. The extracellular matrix is a main component of this microenvironment. The connection and interaction between the ECM components is complex and multifunctional. Beside its function in many physiologic processes, such as elasticity of the tissues, organ homeostasis, embryonic development, immune response, signal transduction and wound healing processes, it is also involved in cancer progression and a series of metastasis associated sub-processes. Starting by the detachment of tumor cells from the primary tumor, the invasion, migration and escape from the immune response, as well as the induction of angiogenesis and inflammation, the involvement of the ECM is scientifically validated. Not only macromolecules such as collagens and proteoglycans, but also other collagenous proteins, like fibronectin and laminin, as well as non-collagenous proteins, such as osteopontin and SPARC seem to be involved in CRC progression and its liver metastasis. In addition, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a major component of the surrounding stroma of carcinomas that emerge in the tumor microenvironment as a result of signals derived from the cancer cells. Biochemical cross-talk between cancer cells and CAFs as well as mechanical remodeling of the stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) by CAFs are important contributors to tumor cell migration and invasion, which are critical for cancer progression from a primary tumor to metastatic disease. Therefore, cancer-associated cellular stroma evolving from ECM should be crucially integrated with CRC diagnosis, staging and treatment. Integrating diverse types of prognostic information into accurate, individualized estimates of outcome in CRC is challenging. Hence, creating a risk-diagnostic based model for personalized treatment is a promising future research trait in CRC treatment. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {Genes interact with both pre- and postnatal environments potentially affecting several important traits in beef cattle. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the existence of genotype by prenatal nutritional environment interaction using genomic information in growth traits, birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW) and yearling weight (YW) in a composite beef cattle breed (50% Red Angus, 25% Charolais, and 25% Tarentaise). Dams were randomly assigned to be fed in two levels of harvested supplemental feed from Dec to March of each year that were expected to result in adequate (ADEQ) or marginal (MARG; ∼ 61% of the supplemental feed provided by ADEQ) levels of protein based on average quality and availability of winter forage. This design resulted in two prenatal nutritional environments: MARG and ADEQ. A total of 3,020 records were used in a two-trait model treating each environment as a different trait. Genetic parameters for all three traits were estimated using genomic information. The direct genetic correlations between environment ADEQ and MARG were 0.97, 0.97 and 0.99 for BW, WW and YW respectively. On the other hand, the maternal genetic correlations between the two environments were 0.62, 0.41 and 0.73 for BW, WW and YW respectively. Furthermore, direct and maternal genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) using single step genomic BLUP were computed and the solutions of SNP markers were back solved from the resulting GEBVs to compare genomic regions associated with the two environments. The present study demonstrated the existence of maternal genetic by prenatal nutritional environment interaction especially for BW and WW in beef cattle. © 2019},

Both the western diet and special diets can have a relevant impact on the microbiome and promote the development of various diseases. There has been an increase in food-related disorders in recent years, largely associated with dramatic changes in food consumption trends and main nutrients. A major response to food intolerances has been the adoption of new dietary trends involving the reduction or exclusion of specific food ingredients. Especially gluten-containing, but also gluten-free cereals are in the cross-fire. Supporters of the gluten-free diet argue that gluten triggers inflammation and related diseases, while followers of the Paleo diet drastically impeach all cereals as dangerous for human health. To date, no controlled studies support or reject a positive health effect of a gluten-free or cereal-free diet. Future large-scale studies need to evaluate the effect of gluten-containing and gluten-free cereals and the various diets on human health, inflammatory parameters, clinical symptoms, and the gut microbiota (including the bacteria, fungi, and viruses). Dietary-associated changes in compositional and functional microbiota traits should be correlated with the health status for the future development of dietary recommendations and potential clinical interventions.},

	abstract = {Dairy cattle farming in developing countries is mainly by resource poor smallholder farmers. Intensification of production within smallholder production systems is being driven by increasing demand for animal products. Current intensification is driven by importation of high-input high-output genotypes. This puts in question the sustainability of these resource constrained systems under harsh environmental conditions. Sustainability of production systems can be defined as long-term resilience and productivity. We use deterministic simulations to compare the impacts of three criteria to define breeding objectives i.e., economic, desired gains and non-market value, on annual genetic and monetary gains in production (market) and functional (non-market) traits for a small-sized nucleus genomic selection breeding program under developing country conditions. Market traits considered were milk yield (MY) and mature body weight (MBW). Non-market traits were calving interval (CI) and production lifetime (PLT). Fat yield (FY) was also considered a non-market trait as it had no market value. With the economic objective, traits were weighted on economic values. Weights for desired gains and non-market (NM) values were derived iteratively. Economic objectives placed highest emphasis on MY with very little gains in non-market traits but had the highest returns on investment. For desired gains objective, maximal achievable gains in PLT, CI and FY were lower than the indicated desired gains. The non-market value objective achieved the best compromise between gains in MY and other traits. We conclude that non-market value objectives can be applied to direct selection towards more robust genotypes but with loss in monetary gain. Breeding robust genotypes can contribute to sustainable intensification in developing small-holder dairy systems. However, for such objectives to be satisfactory, a sound criterion is required to determine declines in genetic gains for market traits that are acceptable by producers. © 2019},

In order to ensure the viability of the commercial cattle and sheep production sector in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, structured breed improvement programs are needed. The study aims to better understand selection decisions of cattle and sheep breeders and their trait preferences for local and imported breeds. Methods: 49 cattle and 31 sheep breeders in peri-/urban areas of the city were approached in personal interviews. Data were analyzed in R version 3.5.1. Results: The main motivation for keeping cattle and sheep was to generate regular cash income through the selling of milk (cattle only) and surplus animals. Some (modern) breeders used imported breeds because of higher production performances. For imported cattle breeds, improved breeding technologies and management were applied to further enhance production outputs. Nevertheless, local livestock breeds were predominantly used due to their good adaptation. Conclusions: Selection decisions and trait preferences for local and imported cattle and sheep breeds were strongly based on performance traits. Especially sheep breeders, but also traditional cattle breeders, did not record performance traits and did not take conscious breeding decisions. © 2019, MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In several areas where Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) have come in contact following successful invasions, Ae. aegypti have been rapidly displaced by Ae. albopictus. Recent work has confirmed that mating interference, in the form of satyrization, is likely a driving factor in these competitive displacements. However, in sites of sympatry, Ae. aegypti females evolve resistance to satyrization, and in the laboratory, satyrization-susceptible Ae. aegypti can evolve resistance within a few generations of cage exposure to Ae. albopictus. The resistance trait may be costly to maintain, as satyrization-resistant females have been shown to invest more time in mate selection. Here, we show that increased satyrization-resistance does not persist in the absence of satyrization pressure, confirming a cost to maintaining this trait. Ae. aegypti lines that had been previously selected for increased satyrization-resistance demonstrated rapid decreases in this trait over eight generations. Support for the hypothesis that condition-dependent mate preferences lead to variation in mating choice among individuals of differing quality within a population has been accumulating. Here we examine how age-related changes in reproductive effort or reproductive value may result in age-dependent mate choice. We hypothesize that older, lower quality individuals may be more likely to accept a subpar mating, in this case an interspecific mating. Our results demonstrate that mosquito age significantly affects interspecific mating rates with older mosquitoes (male and female) engaging in interspecific mating more frequently than younger counterparts (26.32 vs 9.41%). We discuss the possibility of age-related signal variation causing the breakdown of mating barriers with age. © The Author(s) 2019.

	abstract = {One of the most important challenges in clinical oncology is the prevention and treatment of metastatic disease. Tumor metastasis involves tumor cell invasion and migration from the primary tumor, intravasation into the vasculature, dissemination and survival in the circulation, extravasation into distant tissues, survival and metabolic adaptation in the distant tissue, dormancy, reactivation, and overt colonization to form a new macroscopic tumor at a distant site. This process is highly inefficient; it has been estimated that less than 0.01% of tumor cells that enter the circulation develop into metastases. Despite this inefficiency, metastases are responsible for more than 90% of all cancer-related deaths. Understanding the biology and vulnerabilities of metastatic tumor cells is of critical importance if we are to improve overall survival rates in cancer patients. Recent studies have characterized the molecular and phenotypic makeup of metastatic tumor cells. In addition, it is now appreciated that cellular and molecular constituents of the tumor microenvironment also greatly affect metastatic tumor progression. This chapter describes the cellular and molecular traits driving tumor metastasis and discusses how the tumor microenvironment influences this process. Most important, it addresses how this knowledge can be translated into current and future cancer therapies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Recent adverse climatic changes have limited crop productivity, which in turn causes food crises throughout the globe, but this is more concerning for developing countries. Interest for practical genomics as well as proteomics is currently widespread to understand the mechanism(s) of stress tolerance. The information gained through the said methods would facilitate the nutritional management and metabolic and genetic improvement of plants of our interest. Genomic and proteomic studies of control and stressed plants have empowered the recognizable proof of various traits and proteins that assume vital part in granting stress resistance to plants. Therefore, identification of “stress-responsive” protein(s)/gene(s) and utilization of thus obtained data provide a great chance to reduce effects of any particular or combined stress on plant. On the other hand, it is also necessary to investigate the cross talk between key stress reaction pathways/components in order to better understand the regulation of protection mechanism. This review provides a critical and extensive analysis of the proteomic profiling of plants in reply to heavy metal stress and highlights key techniques being employed for accomplishing ever-desired success. It also revealed an account of proteins identified to impart resistance under different abiotic stresses in plants. In addition, we present the role of functional genomics and various bioinformatics tools to understand the proteome maps of heavy metal-stressed plants. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of castration on carcass and meat quality traits of Nellore cattle harvested after 0, 100 or 200 days on feed. Thirty-six Nellore calves averaging 256.1 ± 3.05 kg of body weight and 8.2 ± 0.07 months of age were used. Half of the calves were randomly selected for surgical castration one-week prior to weaning. Post-weaning calves were penned and adapted to a common finishing diet. Six bulls and six steers were selected to be harvested after 0, 100 or 200 days on feed. Carcass and meat quality traits were evaluated. Data were analyzed as a completely randomized design with a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments including two sex conditions and three harvest times. Castration by time on feed interaction was found (P < 0.01) for intramuscular fat and for kidney, pelvic and heart fat. The bull carcasses were heavier (P < 0.05) than those of steer. Regardless of time on feed, castration increased (P < 0.05) backfat thickness. Although unaged meat shear force was similar (P > 0.05) between bulls and steers, castration reduced (P > 0.05) shear force and increased myofibrillar fragmentation index of 14 days aged meat. Castration increased (P < 0.05) postmortem desmin degradation. All carcass traits were improved (P < 0.05) by time on feed, except dressing. Carcasses from cattle harvested at 0 day on feed had higher (P < 0.05) chilling rate and lower pH decline (P < 0.05). Shear force change from 1 to 14 days postmortem reduced (P < 0.05) as time on feed increased. In conclusion, although intensively raised young bulls have similar unaged meat quality than steers, castration improves aged meat tenderness and intramuscular fat. Overall, increasing time on feed improves carcass and meat quality traits. © 2019},

	abstract = {Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common female endocrine disorder that often results in infertility. It is a complex, heterogeneous trait of uncertain etiology, but there is strong evidence that it is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recently, numerous studies have been performed as the role of genetic factors involved in metabolic disorders, sex hormones, and inflammation has become more widely accepted. In the past few years, we have tried to identify several novel genes and proteins relevant to PCOS, involved in angiogenesis, insulin signaling, and inflammation. Of these, genes of tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), leptin receptor (LEPR), adiponectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), follicle stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and insulin receptor (INSR) are linked to the chronic inflammation and insulin signaling pathway. Pre-genome wide association study (GWAS) has been a very powerful tool for identifying the pathogenesis of PCOS, even though most of the strongest associations are for loci rather than functional variants. A trend towards large-scale GWAS has succeeded in identifying many additional novel PCOS loci. Most of the PCOSassociated regions are shared with other diseases or symptoms, as well as with metabolism, inflammation or insulin signaling-related traits, or cancer. Moreover, susceptibility genes for early diagnosis of PCOS are anticipated to offer the prevention of long-term risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well. Furthermore, advanced new technical approaches such as GWAS and next generation sequencing (NGS) will provide new opportunities in the molecular analysis of PCOS, which can, in the long term, lead to the development of new therapeutic treatments for the disorder. To date, very little was known about the etiology of PCOS, and the mechanisms by which this disorder develops are still unclear. Having identified compelling genetic signals, the functional analyses of these should be assessed to see how the associated alleles regulate gene or protein function. Furthermore, structural variations and epigenetic signatures are also likely to contribute to the genetic background of this disorder. In pursuit of understanding the genetic mechanisms of complex traits, risk prediction models should be established, in order to develop minimally invasive methods of diagnosis and to achieve effective targeted therapy. Alternatively, molecular markers that identify a female population who are just developing the disorder at pubarche would benefit from earlier intervention of the disease, as diagnosing PCOS is particularly problematic among female population lacking even expert consensus. In conclusion, GWAS methodology and potential functional mechanisms are becoming crucial in investigating genetic association with PCOS. Undoubtedly, GWAS has succeeded in identifying many additional novel PCOS loci. Genes and related pathways involved in PCOS have not been completely identified yet. More importantly, a rational strategy for genetic investigation of PCOS is essential and studies should avoid small sample duplication. Moreover, elucidating the exact functions of these genes or gene products would shed light on the pathogenesis of PCOS and facilitate the development of efficient therapeutics for PCOS. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {The study of locally adapted breeds has the potential to underpin the discovery of genes involved in economically and ecologically important traits. Brazilian locally adapted sheep breeds have distinctive characteristics that could be of value for specialized production systems. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to identify genomic regions that may have been under selection and therefore may explain ecological and production differences observed among three important Brazilian locally adapted sheep breeds. Animals from the Brazilian Creole, Morada Nova and Santa Ines breeds were genotyped using the Illumina Ovine SNP50 BeadChip. The identification of selection signatures was based on two groups of methodologies: differentiation among populations (FST) and linkage disequilibrium (iHS and RsB). Taken together, these analyses allowed for the identification of 86 candidate genes. Functional analysis revealed genes related to immunity, nervous system development, reproduction and sensory perception. A number of genes are of particular interest including: RXFP2, which has recently been associated with the presence/absence and morphology of horns in sheep; the TRPM8 gene, involved in regulation of body temperature at low temperatures; DIS3L2, PLAG1 and NIPBL, associated with height variation; and finally, SPEF2 and SPAG6, important for spermatogenesis. Selective sweeps were identified using multiple methods, and in a number of cases sweep regions contained genes with a demonstrated role in phenotypic variation. The genomic distribution of the sweep regions differed between populations, suggesting that breed specific signatures were successfully identified that may reflect the consequence of local adaptation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This review charts the major developments in the genetic manipulation of plant cells that have taken place since the first gene transfer experiments using Ti plasmids in 1983. Tremendous progress has been made in both our scientific understanding and technological capabilities since the first genetically modified (GM) crops were developed with single gene resistances to herbicides, insects, viruses, and the silencing of undesirable genes. Despite opposition in some parts of the world, the area planted with first generation GM crops has grown from 1.7 Mhm2 in 1996 to 179.7 Mhm2 in 2015. The toolkit available for genetic modification has expanded greatly since 1996 and recently Nobel Laureates have called on Greenpeace to end their blanket opposition, and plant scientists have urged that consideration be given to the benefits of GM crops based on actual evidence. It is now possible to use GM to breed new crop cultivars resistant to a much wider range of pests and diseases, and to produce crops better able to adapt to climate change. The advent of new CRISPR-based technologies makes it possible to contemplate a much wider range of improvements based on transfer of new metabolic pathways and traits to improve nutritional quality, with a much greater degree of precision. Use of GM, sometimes in conjunction with other approaches, offers great opportunities for improving food quality, safety, and security in a changing world. © The Author(s) 2016.},

The climate change scenario assumed to be a major threat to animal production systems under tropical climate. The demand of food or the food security issue compel us to a holistic approach to sustainable livestock production system that may be one of the remedies for fulfilling the demand of fast growing population. The objective of this review is to focus the major effect on dairy production system and different strategies to overcome the adverse effect of heat stress under tropical climatic conditions. The identification of unique adaptive traits between and within breeds and their propagation seem to be essential in near future in respect of climate change scenario. The management and feeding strategies revealed to be beneficial for relieving adverse effects of heat stress for maintaining the productivity of dairy animals. Nevertheless, decision makers, extension services and research institutions have to support and encourage livestock activities to enhance the animal productivity under changed climate scenario. © 2018 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

Through their functional traits, interactions with both abiotic and biotic environment, and their own successional dynamics, they significantly affect woody vegetation succession coupled with soil and ecosystem development. In this chapter, we review the role of ECM fungi in the processes of early primary and secondary succession, including non-anthropogenic natural systems, like glacier forefronts, volcanic deserts, and sand dunes, as well as major sites disturbed by intensive human activity, such as mine spoils, fire-affected sites, clear-cuts and timber harvesting areas, and post-agricultural lands. Successional traits of ECM fungal community reflecting their life histories and species composition, dispersal, spatial and temporal structure, host preferences, and sensitivity to environmental filters underpin key ecosystem services provided by ECM fungi in the processes of forest development, management, and restoration. While the rapidly increasing influence of climate change, environmental damage, species invasions, and biodiversity reduction become obvious, ECM fungi and their successional traits must be considered in afforestation and carbon sequestration polices, in sustainable forest management, as well as in biodiversity conservation and rehabilitation practices. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

	abstract = {Sage (Salvia L.) is one of the largest genera in the family Lamiaceae. Species in the genus are used to preserve foods and a spice for flavoring, ornamental plants in parks and gardens. In addition, several species of this genus are utilized in medicine and fragrance industries. The utilization of molecular markers in Salvia lags behind many other plant species. Molecular markers are proteins/isozymes, secondary metabolites, deoxyribonucleic acid or ribonucleic acid (DNA/RNA) sequences that could be thought as signs or marks differentiation one locus or an individual from others. DNA markers (DMs) define the location of traits, genes or indicate differences within and between genomes of individuals. The earlier application of DMs was the fingerprinting studies and later onDMs were extensively used in plant genetic mapping and gene identification studies. Currently DMs are routinely used in plant variety identification, protection, conservation, genetic stock development, marker-assisted breeding, association and ecological studies. Genotyping by sequencing (GBS), high-throughput marker systems based on next generation sequencing (NGS), makes DMs more effective. Future technologies of molecular markers would not only detect and locate the genome-wide genetic differences at the single nucleotide level, but also will detect the epigenetic differences in the whole genome. DMs will be extensively used in genome mapping and genome selection research in next generation breeding studies. In this chapter, the technical aspects, types and principles of traditional and NGS based DMs used in plant research are briefly introduced. DMs are technically classified as traditional PCR-based, hybridization-based, PCR-restriction enzyme based, PCR-hybridization based and NGS-based GBS markers. DMs are also classified as genetic and genic (functional) markers. Furthermore, DMs could be classified as low-throughput and high-throughput markers. In some other resources, molecular markers are classified as the first, second, third, fourth and next generation marker systems. DMs could be classified as nuclear, plastid (chloroplast), mitochondrial markers, or in silico based markers. In this chapter, DMs are reclassified based on their technical principles and will be revisited emphasizing on their use in Salvia. This chapter also deals with genome-wide genetic markers and molecular markers for secondary metabolites. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2017. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aquatic wild birds have been intensively studied to better understand their role in avian influenza virus (AIV) maintenance and spread. To date, AIV surveillance has primarily focused on natural aquatic environments where different bird species aggregate and viral survival is enhanced. However, artificial habitats such as landfills are attracting substantial numbers of wild birds, AIV reservoir species included. The use of landfills as a predictable food source has significantly influenced population size, migratory traits, and feeding behavior of white storks (Ciconia ciconia) and black-headed gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) among others. Considering the proximity of landfills to urban settlements and frequently poultry-farms, targeted monitoring of AIV in bird species that forage at landfills but are known to also frequent urban and agricultural habitats could be a useful means for monitoring of AIV, especially during periods of bird aggregation. During the wintering season 2014-2015, the prevalence of AIV in five avian species at two landfills in South-Central Spain was explored by rRT-PCR and species related temporal variation in AIV prevalence determined. We collected and tested 1,186 fresh fecal samples from white storks (N = 689), cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis, N = 116) and mixed flocks of gulls (N = 381) as well as cloacal and oral swabs from five birds found dead. Seven samples contained AIV, five from gulls and one each from a stork and a cattle egret. Overall, AIV prevalence was 0.60%. No significant temporal variation was observed in AIV prevalence. Prevalence differed significantly among the sampled taxonomic groups, being highest in gulls (1.31%). H16N3 subtype was detected from a cattle egret and H11N9 subtype from a white stork, whereas gulls harbored both subtypes in addition to H11N3 subtype. H16 subtype detection in a cattle egret evidences its host range may not be restricted to gulls. Our results indicate that wild birds foraging at landfills may carry different LPAIV subtypes. © 2017 Bárbara, Torrontegi, Camacho, Barral, Hernández and Höfle.},

Acremonium lolii Latch, Christensen & Samuels also imparts insect resistance to perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Such mutualistic symbioses may provide a means of supplementing conventional plant breeding, to further improve abiotic and biotic stress resistances in grasses.

Additionally, the connection between the identified polymorphism and the somatic cell score (SCS) was tested. Two hundred and six Polish Holstein-Friesian cows were genotyped using the PCR-RFLP method. One SNP mutation (c.126G > A) was identified within the coding sequence of the analyzed gene. Results of logistic regression analysis displayed no significant association between the IL-17A genotype and clinical mastitis occurrence (Wald chi-square test = 0.74; P = 0.69). The GLM analysis demonstrated that genotype also did not affect the SCS (P = 0.77), while the effects of age at first calving, lactation number, lactation stage, mean milk yield per milking day, and milk yield on the day of milk recording proved to be highly significant (P < 0.01). The present study was one of the first to show an association between polymorphism within the IL-17A gene and selected udder health traits in cattle. An influence of the c.126G > A polymorphism on clinical mastitis and the SCS in the studied set of Polish Holstein-Friesian cows was not found.

	abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci associated with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) susceptibility, but further progress requires integration of epidemiology and biology to illuminate true risk loci below genome-wide significance levels (P <5 × 10-8). Most risk SNPs lie within non-protein-encoding regions, and we hypothesize that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) genes are enriched at EOC risk regions and represent biologically relevant functional targets. Methods: Using imputed GWAS data from about 18,000 invasive EOC cases and 34,000 controls of European ancestry, theGENCODE(v19) lncRNA database was used to annotate SNPs from 13,442 lncRNAs for permutation-based enrichment analysis. Tumor expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis was performed for sub-genome-wide regions (1 × 10-5 > P > 5 × 10-8) overlapping lncRNAs. Results: Of 5,294 EOC-Associated SNPs (P <1.0-10-5), 1,464 (28%) mapped within 53 unique lncRNAs and an additional 3,484 (66%) SNPs were correlated (r2 > 0.2) with SNPs within 115 lncRNAs. EOC-Associated SNPs comprised 130 independent regions, of which 72 (55%) overlapped with lncRNAs, representing a significant enrichment (P =5.0 × 10-4) that was more pronounced among a subset of 5,401 lncRNAs with active epigenetic regulation in normal ovarian tissue. EOC-Associated lncRNAs and their putative promoters and transcription factors were enriched for biologically relevant pathways and eQTL analysis identified five novel putative risk regions with allele-specific effects on lncRNA gene expression. Conclusions: lncRNAs are significantly enriched at EOC risk regions, suggesting a mechanistic role for lncRNAs in driving predisposition to EOC. Impact: lncRNAs represent key candidates for integrative epidemiologic and functional studies. Further research on their biologic role in ovarian cancer is indicated. © 2016 American Association for Cancer Research.},

	abstract = {In the Black Sea copepod species from marine and coastal areas (including Ponto- Caspian and boreal relicts, old Mediterranean immigrants and recent Atlantic and Indo- Pacific invaders), the salinity tolerance ranges and osmotic responses to salinity changes were estimated. Also, the effect of temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration on respiration rate, feeding, growth and locomotion activity was studied in these copepods. In comparison with native marine species, conspecific alien copepods possessed wider salinity tolerance ranges and were able to osmoregulate. Moreover, the Ponto-Caspian relict Calanipeda aquaedulcis, capable to survive as in fresh as in hypersaline water, was found to be an exceptional osmoconformer over the salinity range of 0.2 to 40 psu. A population strategy of overwintering (unknown for cyclopoid copepods) was first reported for the warm-water Indo-Pacific cyclopoid Oithona davisae. The unique specific adaptation to local temperature and oxygen regimes was shown in Calanus helgolandicus (dominating species in the open zone of the Black Sea). Due to diel vertical migrations from surface warm oxygenated layers to deep cold hypoxic zones, the late developmental stages of this species can decrease their energy requirements and increase the duration and efficiency of lipid accumulation in the form of wax esters. Therefore, the values of definitive body size, lipid amount and productivity in the Black Sea C. helgolandicus are as high as those in Calanus species from the more productive North Atlantic seas. This review aims to synthesize the understanding of the processes of behavioral and physiological adaptation of the copepod species to the highly diversificated Black Sea environment. © 2018 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

Therefore, the development of new remedies and the utilization of natural medicines that target metastasis are of great interest and have been studied extensively. Chinese medicinal herbs have various anti-carcinogenesis properties; however, the in vitro effect and mechanism of Viola yedoensis on cancer cell metastasis remains poorly understood. V. yedoensis extracts (VYE) can suppress the invasion of a highly metastatic human lung cancer cell line, A549 cells. According to gelatin zymography and casein zymography assays, VYE inhibited the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA). The results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting revealed that VYE can alter the expression of proteinase inhibitor. VYE also suppressed the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B. We concluded that VYE may inhibit tumor invasion by suppressing the activities of MMP and u-PA in lung cancer cells. © Ivyspring International Publisher.},

In general, the negative effects of the high temperature are more significant than the effects of low temperatures. In this study, seasonal variations of body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, serum T3 and T4 levels were investigated on Karya, Kivircik and Karacabey Merino sheep in Mediterranean climate conditions. The aim of the study was to describe the stress in animals due to high temperatures all through the year with regard to some physiological and hormonal parameters. In general, heart rates in the spring, the summer, the autumn and in the winter seasons were found as 108.53, 100.10, 101.10 and 107.30 units/min.; the respiratory rates were found as 60.15, 78.99, 56.40 and 46.97 breaths/min.; the body temperatures were recorded as 39.67, 39.49, 39.36 and 39.60 °C, and the serum T3 levels were found as 1.35, 1.20, 0.95 and 1.54 ng/ml; and the serum T4 levels as 73.90, 61.29, 50.67 and 63.49 ng/ml, respectively. Seasons were found effective on respiratory rates, on body temperatures and on serum T3 and T4 levels. The Genotype trait created differences only on serum T3 and T4 levels. When the so- called seasonal changes in some parameters like respiratory rate were taken into account, it could be said that animals were affected by the high level of ambient temperature in the summer season. Karacabey Merinos displayed reactions to seasonal climatic changes similar to Karya and Kivircik reactions with regard to the physiological parameters and thyroid hormone levels that were dealt with in this study and that are the indicators of the adaptation to the seasonal environmental conditions. © 2018 Lietuvos Veterinarijos Akademija.},

	abstract = {The recent emergence of the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system has attracted significant attention for its potential to improve traits of agricultural importance. However, most applications in livestock species to date have depended on aberrant DNA repair to generate frameshifting indels. Whether this genomic engineering technique involving homology-dependent repair (HDR) can be used to introduce defined point mutations has been less explored. Previously, we reported a G→A point mutation (g.231A>G, p.Val397Ile) in the growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) gene that has a large effect on the litter size of cashmere goats. In the present study we report that by co-injecting synthesised RNAs and single-stranded oligo deoxynucleotide (ssODN) donor sequences into goat zygotes, we successfully introduced defined point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions in the proteins as expected. The efficiency of this precise single-nucleotide substitution in newborn kids was as high as 24% (4/17), indicating that ssODN-directed HDR via zygote injection is efficient at introducing point mutations in the goat genome. The findings of the present study further highlight the complex genome modifications facilitated by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which is able to introduce defined point mutations. This represents a significant development for the improvement of reproduction traits in goats, as well as for validating the roles of specific nucleotides in functional genetic elements in large animals. © CSIRO 2018.},

This parenchyma would be a water accumulation site during dry periods and it is therefore an effective mechanism for drought adaptation. The anatomical parameters studied also show significant variations. The other anatomical parameters of the leaf also have a very pronounced variability. It is shown through this study that morpho-anatomical models are established. Thus, the increase of the water reserve parenchyma thickness is accompanied by an increase of the chlorophyll parenchyma and the stomatal density, and the opposite situation was observed. © 2018, Agricultural Academy, Bulgaria.

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to investiget the effect of different kinds of egg yolk (hen, quail, turkey, and duck) on the awassi ram semen quality after cryopreservation. The semen was collected by using artificial vagina from four awassi rams and then evaluated, after pooling the semen samples and dilution with tris which contain egg yolk made from poultry birds (10%) and glycerol (5%).The samples were kept in 4C for two hours and then exposed to liquid nitrogen vapor for (10min) and suck in liquid nitrogen, one month later, the samples were thawed at 37C for(5min).the sperm motility, membrane integrity, the percentage of dead and abnormal sperm and DNA fragmentation determination were evaluated. The results showed that yolk of quail egg recorded the higher percent of sperm motility and membrane integrity in comparison with other birds (40.85, 43.85%) respectively. No significant (P > 0.05) differences were recorded between quail yolk egg and duck yolk egg for dead and abnormal sperm. The yolk of quail eggs Foard the lowest percentage of DNA fragmentation (8.8%) while no significant difference was recorded between yolk of hen egg, turkey and duck. It can be conclude that the ability of using yolk of quail eggs as substitute of yolk of hen in the semen ram dilutions. © The Iraqi Journal of Agricultural Science - College of Agriculture \ Baghdad University 2015.; كان اليدف من ىذه الد ا رسة ىو تحديد تأثير أنواع مختمفة من صفار البيض )الدجاج،السمان،التركي،البط( عمى نوعية السائل المنوي لمكباش العواسية بعد الحفظ بالتجميد.تم جمع السائل المنوي باستخدام الميبل الاصطناعي من أربع كباش عواسي وتقيمو ، وبعد تجميع عينات السائل المنوي ،واج ا رء التخفيف بمخفف الترس والذي يحتوي عمى صفار البيض لطيور الداجنة ٪01 ( وكميسيرول ) 5٪(. تم وضع العينات عند درجة ح ا ررة 4 مْ لمدة ساعتين، بعدىا تعرضت العينات لبخار النيتروجين ( السائل لمدة ) 01 دقائق( وتغطس في النيت روجين السائل، بعد شير يتمت أذابة العينات عند درجة ح ا ررة 73 مْ لمدة 5 دقائق،تم تقييم حركة وسلامة الغشاء البلازمي لمنطف ، ونطف الميتة والمشوىة وتجزؤ المادة الو ا رثية. أظيرت النتائج ان صفار بيض السمان سجل اعمى نسبة مئوية لحركة وسلامة الغشاء البلازمي بالمقارنة مع صفار بيض الطيور الاخرى) 41.05 بين صفار بيض السمان والبط لمنطف الميتة والمشوىة ، سجل )P > %47.05 (بالترتيب .لم تسجل فروقات معنوية ) 0.05 ، صفار بيض السمان اقل نسبة مئوية لتجزؤ المادة الو ا رثية ) 0.0 %( في حين لم تظير فروقات معنويو بين صفار بيض الدجاج والتركي والبط. تشير النتائج الى امكانية أستعمال صفار بيض السمان كبديل عن صفار بيض الدجاج في مخخف السائل المنوي لمكباش.},

	abstract = {Here, we compared the effects of ram, buck and dromedary camel seminal plasma mixed with TRIS-egg yolk glycerol extender on the freezing preservation of ram semen. Awassi ram semen samples underwent primary evaluation and were then pooled and diluted with the following diluents: TRIS-egg yolk glycerol mixed with (1) whole ram semen as a control (T); (2) ram sperm after seminal plasma removal (W); or (3) ram, (4) buck or (5) camel seminal plasma (R, B and C, respectively). The diluted semen was frozen using liquid nitrogen vapor. Various sperm parameters were evaluated in the frozen semen. Total motility before and after freezing was significantly higher in R, B and C diluents than in T and W diluents. Progressive motility after freezing was significantly higher in R, B, C and T diluents than in W diluent. Vitality after freezing was significantly higher in B than in W diluent. DNA fragmentation before and after freezing was significantly lower in R, B, C and T diluents than in W diluent. Plasma membrane integrity before and after freezing was significantly higher in R, B and C diluents than in W diluent. Sperm abnormalities before freezing were significantly lower in R, B and C diluents than in W diluent. Malondialdehyde concentration was significantly higher in T and W diluents than other diluents. Reduced glutathione concentration was significantly higher in B diluent than other diluents. Moreover, reduced glutathione concentration was significantly higher in C, R and W diluents than in T diluent. Thus, the addition of ram, buck or camel seminal plasma to TRIS-egg yolk glycerol extender improved the quality of frozen ram semen, while seminal plasma removal adversely affected it. Ram, buck and camel seminal plasma had similar effects, with no significant differences between them on the evaluated parameters of frozen ram semen. © 2018 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

	abstract = {Climate strongly influences the geographic distribution and timing of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks. Environmental temperature affects phenotypic traits of mosquitoes including vector competence for arboviruses mediated by changes in infection, extrinsic incubation period and in rates of transmission. Most experiments, however, are done at constant temperatures. In nature, mosquitoes are more likely to experience daily fluctuations in temperature. Here we compare disseminated infection (leg infection) and saliva infection of Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) from Florida following oral exposure to an Asian genotype of chikungunya virus emergent in the Americas. We evaluated experimentally the effect of variable temperature regimens on disseminated infection and saliva infection of these Aedes species. Each of three temperature regimes had approximately the same average temperature (27-28°C), but differed in the magnitude of the diurnal temperature range (DTR). The large DTR was 8.0°C (range 23-31°C) and the small DTR was 4.0°C (range 26-30°C) which approximate ranges in different locations of Florida during July-October when risk of transmission is highest. The constant temperature was set at 27°C. Testing three geographic populations of each mosquito species, significant effects on disseminated infection were detected for an interaction between temperature regime and geographic population for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. There were no significant treatment effects of temperature, geographic population, or temperature by geographic population interaction on saliva infection for either mosquito species. Constant temperature resulted in a higher viral load in the saliva of Ae. albopictus, but not Ae. aegypti, compared to conditions where the temperature fluctuated. © The Author(s) 2017.

The records on first lactation milk yield and reproduction performance of 3,008 crossbred cattle spread over a period of 18 years (1995-2012) were used for the study to assess the impact of crossbred cattle performance in this area. The production traits considered were age at first calving (AFC), first lactation 305-days or less milk yield (FL305DMY), peak yield (PY) and fat%. The overall least squares means for AFC, MY, PY and fat% were estimated as 1092.009±07.96 (days), 3214.488±26.58 kg, 12.922±0.10 kg and 3.739±0.01%, respectively. The effect of sire was highly significant on all the traits while the effect of season was significant on MY, peak yield and fat%. However, the effect of period was highly significant on MY and fat% only. It is also reflected that the fluctuations in extreme climatic conditions did affect these traits in milch crossbred cattle maintained under tropical farming conditions. The heritability estimates of different production traits, viz. FL305DMY, PY and fat% were 0.316±0.054, 0.177±0.042 and 0.064±0.032, respectively.},

The temporal and geographic extent of tick and pathogen dispersal is dependent on tick phenology and host movements across a landscape. We evaluated bird-host traits and habitat characteristics that may influence tick infestation and subsequent dispersal in Illinois. To determine which characteristics of host species and habitats influence infestation, we examined captured birds in 22 forest patches across east-central Illinois during migratory periods in fall of 2012 and 2013, and spring of 2013 and 2014. We examined 1,028 birds of 78 species; 136 (13.2%) individuals representing 33 (42.3%) species were infested with at least one tick. We determined that infestation prevalence was greatest among birds that 1) forage primarily in the forest understory; 2) use large forest patches; 3) use patches with less invasive shrub cover. Furthermore, infestation intensity was greatest among birds captured during fall migration. These findings highlight the importance of avian and habitat traits that may influence tick infestation among passerine birds. © The Authors 2017.},

	abstract = {The sea louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, is parasitic to salmonid species in the Northern Hemisphere and has become a widespread biological and economic problem for the salmon farming industry. A better understanding is needed of their spatial distribution and early life history to disrupt the life cycle of the sea louse. In this study, sea lice larval densities within salmon farms, between salmon farms and reference sites, and at various depths were quantified using both plankton pumps and plankton nets. Farm sites exhibited significantly higher densities than reference sites; however, these densities dropped an order of magnitude at a distance of 100 m from the cages. The majority of the larvae captured in the study were nauplii (93%), and densities ranged from 0 to 10 larvae/m3. Free-swimming sea lice larvae were found to exhibit a diel cycle where nauplii larvae were in deeper waters (10–17 m) during the day and in surface waters (1–6 m) during the night. The results of this study suggest that the early life-history stages of sea lice originate from and may remain close to active salmon farms, creating a self-sustaining population. © 2017 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to characterize the soil macrofauna under different crop systems and compare them to the macrofauna under the native vegetation of a Cerrado/Caatinga ecotone in southwestern Piauí State, Brazil. The areas studied included areas under sweetsop cultivation (Annona squamosa L.), andropogon grass with three years of use, andropogon grass with six years of use, pivotirrigated corn, Napier grass, and native vegetation. In each area, soil layers of 0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, and 0.2-0.3m, including the surface litter, were evaluated following the Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility Program (TSBF) recommendations. The soil macrofauna from the different land-use systems were identified to the family level, and the mean density of each taxon was calculated for each soil-management type and layer. The structure of the soil macrofauna was negatively altered under the different crops in comparison to the native Cerrado/Caatinga vegetation, with macrofaunal occurrence varying in the different soil layers. A correlation existed between the functional groups and the soil grain-size distribution and moisture. Napier grass cultivation favored greater soil macrofaunal abundance, with a predominance of families belonging to the orders Isoptera and Hymenoptera. Number of soil macrofaunal families under pivot-irrigated corn was more like the number observed with the native vegetation, and corn also had greater family diversity compared to the other crops studied. Therefore, pivot-irrigated corn can reduce the impact of anthropogenic land use on the diversity of soil macrofauna. © 2017, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: As ectothermic animals, temperature influences insects in almost every aspect. The potential disease spreading Asian bush mosquito (Aedes japonicus japonicus) is native to temperate East Asia but invasive in several parts of the world. We report on the previously poorly understood temperature-dependence of its life history under laboratory conditions to understand invasion processes and to model temperature niches. Results: To evaluate winter survival, eggs were exposed between 1 day and 14 days to low temperatures (5 °C, 0 °C, -5 °C and -9 °C). Hatching success was drastically decreased after exposure to 0 °C and -5 °C, and the minimal hatching success of 0% was reached at -9 °C after two days. We then exposed larvae to 14 temperatures and assessed their life trait parameters. Larval survival to adulthood was only possible between 10 °C and 31 °C. Based on this, we modelled the optimal (25 °C), minimal (7 °C) and maximal (31 °C) temperature for cumulative female survival. The time to adult emergence ranges from 12 days to 58 days depending on temperature. We used an age-at-emergence-temperature model to calculate the number of potential generations per year for the Asian bush mosquito in Germany with an average of 4.72 potential generations. At lower temperatures, individuals grew larger than at higher temperatures with female R1 length ranging from 3.04 ± 0.1 mm at 31 °C to 4.26 ± 0.2 mm at 15 °C. Conclusions: Reduced egg hatch after exposure to sub-zero temperatures prohibits the establishment of the Asian bush mosquito in large parts of Germany. Larval overwintering is not possible at temperature ≤ 5 °C. The many potential generations displayed per year may contribute to the species' invasion success. This study on the thermal ecology of the Asian bush mosquito adds to our knowledge on the temperature dependence of the species and data could be incorporated in epidemiological and population dynamic modelling. © 2018 The Author(s).},

One of the related tasks was to establish the influence of the genotype on morphological quality of eggs in the five hybrid groups as an element of evaluating their egg production performance. Experiments were performed at the Agricultural Institute – Stara Zagora in 2015. Eggs were collected from five genotypes autosexing hybrid hen strains (by feathering colour). Hybrids crosses were obtained from the following lines of the national gene pool- line Ss (Sussex- Columbian feathering), line NHG (German New Hampshire – red feathering), line P (Rhode Island Red, red feathering), line Е (Barred Plymouth Rock), line I (Barnevelder). For the purpose of investigation morphological traits of eggs, 30 eggs were obtained from 34-week- old layers from each of the five groups. The eggs produced by hybrids from group V were the heaviest – 62.47 g with Barred Plymouth Rock as maternal form, whereas eggs of group IV (line Ss: Sussex as maternal form) were the lightest – 53.50 g at p<0.001. The eggs of the other hybrid groups were at the intermediate level. The weight of the shell with shell membranes had a highest significant value in heaviest eggs- those of hybrids groups I, V, II (6.14 g, 6.13 g and 6.01 g respectively). The egg weight correlated to the shell percentage. The differences were significant at various levels of significance (р < 0.05). The absolute yolk weight did not tend to increase in eggs with higher weight. The trait varied at a various extent among the hybrids groups. The yolk index was not associated to egg weight and yolk weight. The groups with highest egg weight to yolk weight ratio were not the heaviest ones. The eggs of studied hybrids with the highest egg weight had more albumen. In group II, its amount was 36.54 g, group V – 35.83 g, group I – 35.12 g with highly statistically significant differences between groups III and IV. © 2017, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

The successful establishment of Wolbachia infection is largely dependent on the effects of Wolbachia infection to host fitness, but the effects of Wolbachia infection on the individual life-history traits of immature mosquitoes can vary. Here, the effects of life-shortening Wolbachia (wMelPop) on population growth of infected individuals were evaluated by measuring larval survival, developmental time and adult size of Aedes aegypti in intra- (infected or uninfected only) and inter-group (mixed with infected and uninfected) larval competition assays. At low larval density conditions, the population growth of wMelPop infected and uninfected individuals was similar. At high larval densities, wMelPop infected individuals had a significantly reduced population growth rate relative to uninfected individuals, regardless of competition type. We discuss the results in relation to the invasion of the wMelPop Wolbachia infection into naturally uninfected populations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In the era of targeted therapies, patients with gynecological and urogenital malignancies have not yet benefitted from this new class of therapeutical development. Prostate, bladder, kidney, ovary and cervical cancer are highly heterogeneous groups of cancer with variable responses to standard chemotherapies. The highly unmet need in treatment of these kinds of cancers is reflected in the poor prognosis of patients with advanced stage disease. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are non-protein coding transcripts over 200 nucleotides in length. The repertoire of lncRNA functions is rapidly expanding with defined roles in development, as mediators of mRNA decay, host genes for miRNAs, etc. Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant expression of lncRNAs may play an important role in gynecological and urinary cancer biology. Human cells express a family of mitochondrial long non-coding RNAs (ncmtRNAs), whose functional role probably lies outside the mitochondria, based on their cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. One of these transcripts, sense ncmtRNA (SncmtRNA) is expressed in normal proliferating cells, as well as in tumour cells but not in non-dividing cells, suggesting a role in cell cycle progression. Normal proliferating cells also express two antisense transcripts, named ASncmtRNA-1 and ASncmtRNA-2. Remarkably however, tumour cell lines, as well as tumour cells present in gynecological and urinary human biopsies, downregulate the expression of AS-ncmtRNAs. Based on this differential expression pattern, we hypothesized that these transcripts might function as unique mitochondrial-encoded tumour suppressors. In tumour cell lines of prostate, ovary, kidney, bladder and cervix, we found that knocking down the AS transcripts in vitro with antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) induces a strong inhibition of cell proliferation and massive apoptotic cell death, the latter mediated by a drastic reduction in the levels of the inhibitor of apoptosis survivin. Apoptosis is reflected by caspase activation, DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial membrane potential loss, among other emblematic apoptotic traits. The treatment also strongly affects stemness in vitro and loss of migration and invasion factors. The experimental evidence we have obtained in vitro suggests that these transcripts constitute universal targets for the development of a therapy mediated by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO). Therefore, we developed several xenograft models of these cancers and our results suggest a strong efficacy of the ASO therapy in vivo. Finally, we hypothesize that the mechanism of induction of cell death, after ASO treatment, could be mediated by the generation of miRNAs targeting the mRNAs of an array of proteins involved in cell cycle control, cell survival and metastasis. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {In this research, post-thaw effects of bull semen extenders including different amounts of boron (sodium pentaborate) on total motility (TMOT), progressive motility (PMOT), kinetic parameters of spermatozoa (VCL, VSL, VAP, LIN, STR, WOB, ALH, BCF), plasma membrane and acrosome integrity (PMAI) and DNA fragmentation index (DFI) were evaluated. Eight ejaculates were examined from four different bulls. Each ejaculate was split in to five aliquots and extended with standard Tris extender (Control) and 0.4 g boron with 0.5 g glucose (Group 1) 0.5; 0.7; 0.9 g boron without glucose (Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 respectively) were used as experimental groups. After thawing TMOT, PMOT, kinetic traits of spermatozoa, PMAI and DFI were determined. According to motility and progressive motility (66.04%, 50.79%), Group 1 had higher values than the others, but differences between groups were not statistically significant (P>0.05). The highest values of VSL, LIN, STR and WOB were determined (28.15 µm/s, 42.98%, 71.69%, 59.71%) in Group 1 (P<0.05). While other kinetic traits of spermatozoa were higher numerically in Group 1 than the other groups, differences between groups were not statistically significant (P>0.05). The highest PMAI value was determined as 60.84% in Group 1 (P>0.05). The DFI rates were found similar in all control and experimental groups (P>0.05). In conclusion, it was observed that the boron (sodium pentaborate) has positive effects on post-thaw movement and structural traits. In addition, boron has no detrimental effect on DNA fragmentation index in semen freezing.

	abstract = {Host-parasite interactions are often influenced by environmental factors through multiple mechanisms. For example, changes in host food resources may affect multiple host traits (e.g., body size, behavior, immunocompetence), which may increase or decrease infection levels and the impact of parasites on host fitness. We often lack an understanding of which traits are most important for parasite transmission and fitness effects, posing challenges to predicting consequences of changing environmental conditions (e.g., eutrophication). Here, I examined the effects of food resources and host traits experimentally in a larval frog (Rana clamitans Latreille, 1801)—trematode parasite (Echinostoma revolutum Looss, 1899) system. I hypothesized that higher food resources reduce parasite infection and parasite effects on host growth and survival, due to increased host investment in parasite defenses, which I tested in a laboratory experiment. Contrary to my hypothesis, the results indicated that increased food levels enhanced infection in hosts, while the effect of parasites on survival did not depend on host food resources. A potential explanation for the positive effect of food level on infection was size-dependent infection rates (i.e., higher food levels increased infection through increased host growth), which is supported by a positive relationship between host body size and infection. These findings emphasize the complex relationship between host food resources and parasitism and the importance of environmental context and host traits (i.e., body size) in mediating interactions with parasites. The results also have relevance for conservation in light of rising anthropogenic impacts on aquatic systems and recent amphibian declines. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Mastitis is the inflammation of udder parenchyma and mostly occurs due to an invasion of bacteria through its teat canal from environment or during milking procedure. Mastitis is a multifactorial threshold trait resulting from interaction between genetic components of the host, infectious agents and environmental factors (Keviletsu and Yadav 2009).This disease can be identified by abnormalities in the milk, udder parenchyma with or without systemic illness. Mastitis is the most common and costly disease of dairy cattle today and remains one of the major problems for the dairy industry. Significant economic losses are mostly due to pathogen-mediated damage of milk secreting tissue of udder, lower milk yield and its degraded quality, early culling, loss of genetic potential, higher veterinary expenses, and increased labour cost for a farmer. Among the several barriers in achieving the milk production targets, mastitis continues to remain as a most challenging impediment, since the affected quarters show 30% less productivity and cow loses about 50% of production (NAAS 2013). In the affected animals, the milk yield is reduced considerably. Estimates of milk yield loss by different workers range from 100 to 500 kg/cow per lactation. When clinical mastitis occurs, additional costs result from discard of abnormal milk, cost of drugs and veterinary services. According to a study, the estimated loss following clinical mastitis in cows was almost 700 kg in first lactation and 1, 200 kg in the second or higher lactation.},

	abstract = {India was one of the few developing countries to initiate policies for the development of biotechnology even when the biotechnology revolution had not developed fully. Initially the Government of India established in 1983 a Board on Biotechnology, which was converted into the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in 1985. Since then biotechnology has been supported by the Government of India through various programmes, including efforts in capacity building and human resources development. The opening up of the economy and liberalisation since 1991 provided many opportunities for the biotechnology sector in India. India became one of the favourite destinations for biotechnology research and development (R&D) and at the same time attracted foreign direct investments. With India becoming a global player in information technology and enabled services, bioinformatics and bioservices became important sectors in biotechnology. According to a recent estimate, India's bioeconomy is valued at about US$35 billion and the share of agribiotech is US$9 billion (ABLE, 2016). The DBT published its latest biotechnology strategy in December 2015. Many state governments have their own policies and programmes to promote biotechnology. Thus the policy milieu in India for biotechnology has been favourable and, with the increased emphasis on ‘Make in India’ and new opportunities in sectors like biopharmaceuticals and post-genome life sciences, governments have become all the more supportive of biotechnology. Regarding GM crops though, Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) cotton is the only crop that has been allowed for commercialisation. Other GM crops in the pipeline and their respective traits are very important for India to meet its needs in agriculture when threats like climate change, constraints on using water resources and soil degradation loom large. Among scientists in India there is almost a consensus that GM crops have a key role to play and that they pose no significant risks to the environment and human health (Giri and Tyagi, 2016). While the policies for promoting and incentivising biotechnology are important, equally important is a biotechnology regulatory regime that would ensure that benefits from biotechnology are not achieved at the cost of environmental safety, human health and conservation of biodiversity. © Cambridge University Press 2017.},

	abstract = {Tillers are the basic units of growth in forage grasses and tillering is responsible for the adaptation and reestablishment of grass after defoliation. Therefore, it is important to understand the morphological changes of tillers due to defoliation environment and fertilization, which are two important pasture management strategies. In this study, we aimed to characterize the morfologic response of marandu grass tillers before nitrogen fertilization and frequency of defoliation for a better understanding of the phenotypic plasticity of this plant. This study was carried out in two experimental years. The treatments in the first year consisted of different cutting intervals (7, 14, 28, 56, and 112 days). In the second year, besides the same cutting intervals, two fertilization conditions were studied: A low level (21.5 kg.ha-1 P and 75 kg.ha-1 N) and a high level (43 kg.ha-1 P and 300 kg.ha-1 N). A randomized block design was adopted and in experiment two a factorial scheme with four repetitions was used. In both experiments the responses to stem length, leaf blade length, space between leaf blade and leaf area, and weight of tiller increased with cutting intervals. In experiment two, high doses of fertilization provided larger number of vegetative tillers, space between leaf blades, tiller weight, longer leaves and stems, and higher population densities of reproductive tillers with longer cutting intervals. In conclusion, the defoliation and the nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization produced morphologic modifications in marandu grass tillers suggesting the phenotypic plasticity of this grass.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to analyze the expression of microRNAs in relation to p53 status in breast cancer cells and to delineate the role of Moesin in this axis. We used three isogenic breast carcinoma cell lines MCF7 (with wild-type p53), 1001 (MCF7 with mutated p53), and MCF7-E6 (MCF7 in which p53 function was disrupted). MicroRNA expression was analyzed using microarray analysis and confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The 1001 clone with mutant p53 showed 22 upregulated and 25 downregulated microRNAs. The predicted targets of these 47 microRNAs were >700 human genes belonging to interesting functional groups such as stem cell development and maintenance. The most significantly downregulated microRNAs in the p53-mutant cell line were from the miR-200 family. We focused on miR-200c which targets many transcripts involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition including Moesin. We found that Moesin was expressed in 1001 but not in its p53 wild-type parental MCF7 consistent with the observed mesenchymal features in the 1001, such as vimentin positivity, E-cadherin negativity, and ZEB1 positivity in addition to the morphological changes. After Moesin silencing, the p53-mutant cells 1001 reverted from mesenchymal-to-epithelial phenotype and showed subtle reduction in migration and invasion and loss of ZEB1 and SNAIL expression. Interestingly, Moesin silencing restored the 1001 sensitivity to Doxorubicin. These results indicate that loss of miR-200c, as a consequence of p53 mutation, can upregulate Moesin oncogene and thus promote carcinogenesis. Moesin may play a role in metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

Peter Paddington is an overweight prepubescent, and Allison Lee is a lesbian with burn scars. In both novels, the protagonists must navigate their sexuality, even as they in some measure exhibit physical traits that verge upon or merge with disability issues. In both novels, the protagonists seek to avoid their proliferating sexual desires, desires which they feel cause them angst and social isolation. The authors depend on the abnormal, deficient, or divergent body as a character-defining trait, while simultaneously declining to characterize fully their protagonists as disabled. The books offer a narrative arc of teen outsiders who not only are the leads, but are narrators who struggle with their body differences. In doing so, both protagonists display how identity intersects at the category-destabilizing shift between queerness and disability. These characters negotiate the transitional complexities of their bodies—as repositories of difference, as icons of exclusion, and as cultural markers of “inescapable” diversity. © Liverpool University Press.},

However, it is now being realized and accepted that it is essential to include various wood traits while selecting superior genotypes for breeding strategies. We are of the opinion that it is necessary to also include the heartwood content as another important trait because of its commercial value. As a prelude to consider heartwood content as one of the selection traits for tree improvement programs, it becomes imperative to document the variation in this trait in a given population. Information about heartwood formation, progression, and genetics is being studied globally, and preliminary indications are that it is genetically controlled, but the role of environmental factors is also equally important. In this paper, heartwood content variation in known aged plantation and its relationship with tree girth in three important indigenous highly valued tree species-Hardwickia binata (Anjan), Pterocarpus santalinus (Red Sanders) and Santalum album (Indian Sandalwood)-is discussed. Significant variation was observed in young-aged plantations in all the three species. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of reducing dietary nutrient content for pigs from 25 to 130 kg live weight, on performance, carcass traits, meat quality and environmental impact. Forty gilts and 40 barrows were distributed in a randomized block design with two treatments and 10 replications per treatment, with four animals per experimental unit. The feeding program was in four phases. Two diets were formulated for each feeding phase. One was adjusted using the InraPorc® model to minimize crude protein, amino acid and phosphorus excess (LN), and the other (ST) was formulated with standard Brazilian recommendations. No differences were found on performance. The mean ADG and ADFI were 0.919 and 2.46 kg/day, respectively. Carcass characteristics and meat quality were also not affected by the experimental diets. The average total feed cost was 6.8% lower (P<0.05) for animals fed the LN diets. For nitrogen and phosphorus balance, there was no statistical difference in retention, but the nitrogen and phosphorus intake were 15.8% and 9.42% lower for pigs fed LN diets, respectively, and the excretion levels were 24.1% and 14.6% lower for pigs fed LN diets, respectively. Life cycle assessment showed that LN strategy can reduce the environmental impacts of climate change and terrestrial ecotoxicity by about 4%, acidification and eutrophication by 8% and 10%, respectively, and land occupation by 9%. Data suggest that nutritional adjustment is a valuable alternative to standard formulations, without affecting performance, but lowering costs and reducing environmental burdens. © 2017},

Hybrids-backcrosses for immunity to virus Y, field resistance to late blight and resistance to the pathogen Ro1 of the golden potato nematode were evaluated by the method of artificial infection in pot-plant in a greenhouse. Analysis of hybrid progeny for starch content and suitability for processing by the color of chips was carried out under laboratory conditions. According to the results of the analysis of the pedigrees of 10 varieties of potato originating from the two forms of S. chacoense, a high efficiency of recurrent accumulation crosses providing introgression of the dominant immunity genes to the virus Y is revealed, as well as resistance to alternaria, heat and drought. Medium-late varieties with high field resistance of leaves and tubers were created on the basis of unstable to the late blight hybrid (F1 S. chacoense 55 d x Agra) and 3 recurrent crosses. In this case, varieties with medium field resistance to late blight participated in backcrossing. When assessing the collection of wild species for resistance to the pathogen Ro1 of the golden potato nematode, only one new source of S. chacoense 58 d was detected. Analysis of the cleavage in resistance to nematode among populations from the crossing of three-species hybrids (vrn x chc) x tbr and backcross hybrids (vrn x chc) x tbr2 confirmed control of the trait by one dominant gene, which facilitates selection for this feature. Based on the analysis of the frequency of occurrence of hybrids with different starch content in the fissile offspring, it is established that this feature is controlled by a small amount of pure additively acting genes. In the hybrid populations studied, the symmetrical frequency distribution, the presence of transgressions, and the high correlation between the average starch content of parental forms and the average offspring were observed. In a comparative assessment of 36 hybrid populations on the suitability for processing for potato products, methods for selecting parental forms for crossing and timing of the evaluation of the trait in different periods of tuber storage have been identified. Twenty-two hybrids are identified that are suitable for processing during the entire storage period without reconditioning. An increase in the efficiency of the selection process was noted in the repeated use of identical hybrid populations for selection in various environmental and geographical conditions, which significantly reduces the financial costs of creating a variety. © The Iraqi Journal of Agricultural Science - College of Agriculture \ Baghdad University 2015.},

Gradually, breeding objectives have included an increasing number of traits and been reoriented from productivity to functional traits. The Agriculture Orientation Law in 2006 and the emergence of genomic selection in 2009 deeply modified the selection procedures with the end of progeny testing, the implementation of reference populations for accurate genomic prediction, but also larger companies, a lower national influence replaced by company driven strategies and some international initiatives.

	abstract = {                             Background: Indiscriminate use of antibiotics in livestock and poultry farming has caused emergence of new pathogenic strains. The situation has warrented the development of safe and alternative growth promoters and immunity enhancers in livestock. Herbal additives in animal and bird feed is a centuries-old practice. Thus, the present study investigated the efficacy of a standardized formulation of lipophilic turmeric extract containing curcumin and turmerones, (TF-36), as a natural growth promoter poultry feed additive. Methods: The study was designed on 180 one-day old chicks, assigned into three groups. Control group (T                             0                             ) kept on basal diet and supplemented groups T                             0.5                              and T                             1                              fed with 0.5% and 1% TF-36 fortified basal diet for 42 days. Each dietary group consisted of six replicates of ten birds. Body weight, food intake, food conversion ratio, skin colour, blood biochemical analysis and antioxidant status of serum were investigated. Results: Body weight improved significantly in T                             1                              with a 10% decrease in FCR as compared to the control. TF-36 supplementation in T                             1                              enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activity significantly (p < 0.05) with a decrease (p < 0.05) in lipid peroxidation. It also caused a slight yellow skin pigmentation without any change in meat color, indicating the bioavailability of curcumin from TF-36. However, no significant change in the concentration of serum creatinine, total protein and liver enzyme activities were observed, indicating the safety. Conclusion: In summary, we concluded that TF-36 can be a natural feed additive to improve growth performance in poultry, probably due to the better antioxidant activity and antimicrobial effects contributed by the better bioavailability of curcuminoids and turmerones. Besides, curcuminoids and turmerones were also known to be gastroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents.                          © The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Crassostrea rhizophorae and C. gasar oysters are cultivated in the northeast region. Perkinsus parasites infect bivalves, and their effects on oysters from tropical regions are poorly understood. This study evaluated the impact of Perkinsus infection on the productive traits of native oysters. Oysters were sampled bimonthly during 7 months, from July 2010 to February 2011, to evaluate growth rate, mortality and shell color patterns (white and dark-gray) (n = 500), and to determine the prevalence and intensity of Perkinsus (n = 152). Perkinsus and Crassostrea species were determined using molecular tools. Results showed that most dark-gray (90%, n = 20) and white (67%, n = 18) oysters were C. gasar and C. rhizophorae, respectively. Oysters showed a high growth rate and moderate cumulative mortality (44%). C. gasar oysters grew better and showed lower mortality and lower incidence of Perkinsus compared to C. rhizophorae. The mean prevalence of Perkinsus was moderate (48%), but the infection intensity was light (2.2). Perkinsosis affected very small oysters (19.4 mm). In conclusion, native oysters, especially C. gasar, have a great potential for culture, mortality is not associated with perkinsosis, and the shell color of oysters can be used to improve selection for spats with better performance. © 2017, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology.

The epigenome is modifiable through environmental exposures, such as air pollution, tobacco smoke, and diet, and epigenetic dysregulation of tumor-suppressor genes such as mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) and breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) have been identified in healthy individuals that are associated with increased cancer risk. Through the study of these aberrant epigenetic marks and the effect of environmental exposures, epigenetic epidemiology can bring significant insights into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and the risk of disease. In this chapter, the design and selection of appropriate tissues for studies will be addressed. Evidence for epigenetic changes in response to environmental exposures and for the presence of “epimutations” in oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes will be reviewed. In addition, novel approaches to integrated analysis of the epigenome, such as the “epigenetic clock” model of aging, will be discussed and the future directions of the field will be commented upon. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To examine the time related changes in the bacterial flora isolated from the burn patients and to compare the antibiograms of the predominant bacteria. Burn injuries constitute a major health concern with respect to morbidity and mortality as well as cost of management particularly in developing countries. It has been estimated that 75% of all deaths following thermal injuries are related to infection. It is essential for every hospital to determine the specific pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, time-related changes in predominant flora and anti microbial sensitivity profiles. Materials and Methods: 60 burn patients and their microbial isolates were examined during the study period. Periodic swabs were taken from burn wounds of the patients on admission and on 7th, 14th, and 21st days of hospitalization and the isolates were processed for culture, identification and antimicrobial sensitivity as per CLSI guidelines. Results: Among the 240 samples, single organism was isolated in 161 samples (67.1%) and mixed organisms in 22 samples (9.1 %) and no growth in 57 samples (23.7%). Among single isolates pseudomonas aerugenosa was predominant species (20.8%) followed by acinetobacter baumanii (15.4%), staph. aureus (14.1%) and klebsiella (7.5%). Among mixed growth pseudomonas was predominant species (30.4%) followed by acinetobacter (23.9%). klebsiella (17.4 %) and staph. aureus (10.8%). There was time related changes in bacterial isolation from burn wound during hospital stay of patients. On admission, Staph. Aureus was 18.3 %, pseudomonas was 8.3% and klebsiella was 6.6%. No growth found in 48.3% samples. These findings gradually changed with time and on day 21 Pseudomonas was 30% followed by Acinetobacter sp. (21.6%), Staph. aureus (13.3%) and Klebsella pneumoniae (6.6%). No growth was seen in 15% cases only. Antimicrobial sensitivity test showed that pseudomonas was sensitive to Imipenem, Merepenem and Ampicillin. Acinetobacter was also found most sensitive to Amikacin and Tetracycline, followed by Tobramycin. Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to Linezolid, Gentamycin followed by Vancomycin. Conclusion: There were time-related changes in microbial colonization during hospital stay of patients. Effective protocols should be made for burn patients and effort is needed for improving overall infection related morbidity and mortality. © 2017, Ibn Sina Trust. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Biomass is an important phenotypic trait in functional ecology and growth analysis. The typical methods for measuring biomass are destructive, and they require numerous individuals to be cultivated for repeated measurements. With the advent of image-based high-throughput plant phenotyping facilities, non-destructive biomass measuring methods have attempted to overcome this problem. Thus, the estimation of plant biomass of individual plants from their digital images is becoming more important. In this paper, we propose an approach to biomass estimation based on image derived phenotypic traits. Several image-based biomass studies state that the estimation of plant biomass is only a linear function of the projected plant area in images. However, we modeled the plant volume as a function of plant area, plant compactness, and plant age to generalize the linear biomass model. The obtained results confirm the proposed model and can explain most of the observed variance during image-derived biomass estimation. Moreover, a small difference was observed between actual and estimated digital biomass, which indicates that our proposed approach can be used to estimate digital biomass accurately.},

	abstract = {Introduction and Aims: Few studies have investigated the relationship of barroom aggression with both general and barroom-specific alcohol expectancies. The present study investigated these associations in a rarely studied and high-risk population: construction tradespeople. Design and Methods: Male construction tradespeople (n = 211) aged 18–35 years (M = 21.91, SD = 4.08 years) participated in a face-to-face questionnaire assessing general and barroom-specific alcohol expectancies and perpetration of physical and verbal barroom aggression as well as control variables, age, alcohol consumption and trait aggression. Results: Sequential logistic regression analyses revealed that general alcohol-aggression expectancies of courage or dominance were not predictive of either verbal or physical barroom aggression after controlling for age, alcohol consumption and trait aggression. However, barroom-specific alcohol expectancies were associated with both verbal and physical barroom aggression, with positive associations found for expected hyper-emotionality and protective effects for expected cognitive impairment. Discussion and Conclusions: In a population where rates of risky drinking and barroom aggression are high, specific expectations about the effects of drinking in bars may influence subsequent aggressive behaviour in bars.

	abstract = {Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) causes flock mortality as high as 100% in susceptible poultry species but it also poses a threat for humans, particularly viruses of A/goose/Guangdong/96-like (GD/96) lineage. The emergence of novel HPAI viruses in migratory birds is of concern because of the potential for virus spread during migration. In late 2016, novel GD/96 reassortant clade 2.3.4.4 group B avian influenza H5N5 virus was detected in wild birds and domestic poultry in Croatia, concurrently with numerous detections of H5N8 virus of the same clade and group. Sequencing of the full genome of the H5N8 index case isolate (October 2016) and of all three H5N5 isolates (December 2016 -March 2017) has shown that the novel H5N5 reassortant virus most likely emerged as a result of complex reassortment process in Asia from HPAI H5N8 viruses after the later viruses have became established in wild bird population. Concurrent findings of both, H5N5 and H5N8 viruses, at the same locations in Croatia indicate that the H5N5 reassortant virus was introduced from Asia as a subpopulation of H5N8 viruses by the same wild bird flyways. Although the novel H5N5 reassortant virus possesses haemagglutinin of the GD/96 lineage, the virus genome has typical avian virus traits. Apart from mutations T215A in M1 protein and P42S in NS1 protein which are associated to increased virulence in mice, none of the mutations related to increased affinity to human-type (α-2,6) receptors and mammalian host adaptation were found. Nevertheless, the virus poses a serious threat to the poultry industry since high pathogenicity for gallinaceous birds was confirmed by high intravenous pathogenicity index (2.87). © 2017, University of Zagreb, Facultty of Veterinary Medicine.

	abstract = {In modern meat production, broiler chickens are usually barn raised in deep litter where a special structured environment is typically not intended. Natural behaviors of the domestic fowl, such as running freely, pecking, scratching, flapping wings, grooming plumage, resting and sleeping undisturbed, can be restricted by lack of opportunities. Additional welfare concerns in industrial poultry farming are high stocking densities and genetic traits. Consumer surveys show an increasing public awareness of problems in livestock farming and the willingness to make a difference by spending more money on food coming from animal-friendly production. For this segment, the market offers organically produced products at higher costs, whereas the possibility for an intermediate product that meets animal welfare, consumer requirements, and economic aspects has barely been used. By increasing the environmental complexity with the provision of perches (15.9 m per 1000 birds), straw bales (1.7 per 1000 birds), pecking stones (1.1 per 1000 birds) and access to a roofed outside run (624 m2) and by using a reduced stocking density (16 birds per m2) and selecting Cobb Sasso 175 as a slower-growing broiler strain, we intended to improve bird welfare. We therefore established, tested, and scientifically evaluated an alternative rearing concept for broiler chickens on its way to market suitability. In addition, a conventional farm with Ross 308 broilers reared at a stocking density of 23 birds per m2 was evaluated for comparison. The study included 6 rearing periods per concept and an additional 2 rearing periods with the broiler strain Ross 308 under the alternative concept. For the behavioral observations, video recordings were carried out simultaneously in both barns during all rearing periods in a weekly 24-hour interval. Results show that Cobb Sasso broilers reared with the alternative concept were more active during the observation intervals than conventionally reared Ross 308 broilers. The provided enrichment was well accepted and used. The straw bales were used as shelter for resting behavior during the early rearing phase and later as pecking objects and elevated resting areas. Perches were used as of day 9. The provision of environmental enrichment in broiler rearing can stimulate species-specific behaviors and therefore can increase animal welfare while meeting consumer requirements in an economic way. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {The present study was conducted to evaluate the production performance and economics of CARI Nirbheek chickens for backyard farming under semi-arid ecosystem in central Gujarat. The overall mean body weights of CARI Nirbheek chickens at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 and 40 weeks of age were 515.06±9.97, 698.90±16.32, 951.78±18.24, 1139.32±26.96, 1372.73±43.51, 1542.87±49.61, 1721.82±46.35 and 2244.13±51.22 g, respectively. Differences in body weights between male and female chickens were found to be significant. The mortality in CARI Nirbheek chicken during the period from 6 to 20 weeks and 21 to 40 weeks of age was recorded 12.20 and 5.09 per cent, respectively. The average age at first egg laying was recorded 157.46±1.19 days while age at sexual maturity was recorded 173.36±2.71 days. The average hen day egg production up to 40 and 72 weeks of age were recorded 54.94±0.41and 167.89±1.42, respectively. The value for different egg quality traits clearly indicated that the eggs produced from CARI Nirbheek are of superior quality. The benefit cost ratio was recorded 1:4.68 per family for rearing under backyard farming system. From the present study it may be concluded that CARI Nirbheek chickens could be suitable with respect to reproductive and productive performance as well as adaptability in the semi-arid ecosystem. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {The growth and production performance of a promising three way cross was evaluated under farm and backyard conditions to assess its suitability as backyard chicken variety. The data generated on 200 birds from backyard and 136 birds from farm conditions was analyzed to study the effect of sex on growth and rearing system on growth and production traits. Sex had significant influence on body weights from 6 to 16 weeks of age. Sexual dimorphism was clearly observed in three-way cross with significantly higher body weights in cocks than hens under both farm and backyard conditions. The body weight of male and female birds at 16 weeks of age was 1704.12±16.89 and 1308.22±15.11 g, under farm conditions, while it was 1504.44±32.33 and 962.45±28.22 g, respectively in backyard conditions. Sex had significant effect on the shank length at all ages with longer shanks in males. The laying period body weights were significantly higher in farm reared birds. The type of rearing system significantly influenced age at sexual maturity (ASM), egg weight and egg production till 52 weeks of age. The egg production at 40 and 52 weeks of age was significantly lower in scavenging birds grown in backyard conditions. The ASM was 144.55±1.38 and 198.32±12.23 days in farm and backyard conditions, respectively. The egg production at 52 weeks of age was 146.33±4.41 and 118.40±8.11 eggs in farm and backyard conditions, respectively. The annual egg production (72 weeks of age) was 227.81±6.75 eggs in farm. The study concluded that the better performance of this three-way cross under farm and backyard system with respect to growth and egg production makes it a promising egg type variety for rural poultry farming in the country. © 2018 Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

	abstract = {Salmonella are important pathogens worldwide and a predominant number of human infections are zoonotic in nature. The ability of strains to form biofilms, which is a multicellular behavior characterized by the aggregation of cells, is predicted to be a conserved strategy for increased persistence and survival. It may also contribute to the increasing number of infections caused by ingestion of contaminated fruits and vegetables. There is a correlation between biofilm formation and the ability of strains to colonize and replicate within the intestines of multiple host species. These strains predominantly cause localized gastroenteritis infections in humans. In contrast, there are salmonellae that cause systemic, disseminated infections in a select few host species; these "invasive" strains have a narrowed host range, and most are unable to form biofilms. This includes host-restricted Salmonella serovar Typhi, which are only able to infect humans, and atypical gastroenteritis strains associated with the opportunistic infection of immunocompromised patients. From the perspective of transmission, biofilm formation is advantageous for ensuring pathogen survival in the environment. However, from an infection point of view, biofilm formation may be an anti-virulence trait. We do not know if the capacity to form biofilms prevents a strain from accessing the systemic compartments within the host or if loss of the biofilm phenotype reflects a change in a strain's interaction with the host. In this review, we examine the connections between biofilm formation, Salmonella disease states, degrees of host adaptation, and how this might relate to different transmission patterns. A better understanding of the dynamic lifecycle of Salmonella will allow us to reduce the burden of livestock and human infections caused by these important pathogens. © 2017 MacKenzie, Palmer, Köster and White.},

	abstract = {Production of high-quality carcass and meat from goat kids may contribute to an increase in goat farming profitability. The aim was to compare carcass and meat quality traits of Saanen goat kids raised under natural (NR) and artificial (AR) rearing systems and slaughtered at 80 days and 120 days of age. The AR kids were separated from their dams immediately after birth and were fed with a commercial milk replacer, while the NR kids suckled their mothers. The rearing type did not affect the average daily gain, slaughter weight, hot carcass weight, empty body weight, commercial dressing percentage, subjective conformation and fatness scores. In parallel with the increase in slaughter age, the slaughter weight, hot carcass weight, empty body weight and subjective carcass conformation score increased. The rearing type had no effect on instrumental meat quality traits, except for meat Lightness (L*) and Hue values. Meat from NR kids had higher L* and Hue values 1 h and 24 h after cutting than those of AR kids. Warner-Bratzler shear force value increased with the slaughter age, but the meat lightness decreased. The ultimate pH was generally high in all groups, ranging between 5.94 and 6.10. The panellists evaluated the meat from NR kids to be more tender and juicy and also gave the highest tenderness scores to the meat obtained from the kids slaughtered at 80 days of age. As a conclusion, the slaughter age may be more determinant than the rearing type in the occurrence of carcass and meat quality characteristics. © 2018, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

However, although there is a large number of people who own exotic pets, their personalities have seldom been examined. Furthermore, studies of personality of pet owners have focused almost exclusively on typical personality traits, ignoring associations with “dark” traits. Here, we assessed both traditional and some dark personality features in association with pet ownership and attachment in 325 pet owners via an online survey. We predicted that individuals scoring higher on narcissism and borderline personality features would be a) more likely to own exotic pets, and b) less attached to their pets compared with people scoring lower on narcissism and traditional pet owners. Additionally, we theorized that neurotic pet owners would be more attached to their pets compared with less neurotic pet owners. We did not find an association between personality and exotic pet ownership but we found that those high in grandiose narcissism were actually more attached to their traditional pets. Those high in vulnerable narcissism were more attached only if their pets were exotic. Those high in borderline features were less attached to both kinds of pets. Personality assessments including “dark” features of personality may therefore be useful in predicting attachment to pets during the matching process of potential adopters to pets. © 2016, © ISAZ 2016.},

We aimed to investigate whether abdominal adiposity measured by computed tomography (CT) modifies the effects of air pollution on lung function in Korean men.Methods:A total of 1876 men who visited one of two health checkup centers were recruited for this study. Adiposity traits such as visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and total adipose tissue (TAT) areas were measured by CT. We used the annual mean concentrations of ambient air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 10 μm (PM 10).Results:Interquartile range (IQR) increase in annual mean concentration of NO 2 was significantly associated with a 2.5% lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and 2.9% lower forced vital capacity (FVC) (both P<0.05). The decrease in lung function was more strongly associated with adiposity traits than with body mass index. In a stratified analysis of adiposity, compared with subjects with low-VAT area (VAT200 cm 2), those with high-VAT area (VAT>200 cm 2) showed a rapid decrease in FEV 1 with each IQR increase in PM 10 (β=-0.0812; 95% confidence interval (CI) =-0.1590,-0.0035) and NO 2 (β=-0.0979; 95% CI=-0.1611,-0.0346). In the high-VAT group, each IQR increase in NO 2 content was significantly associated with a 10.6% decrease (β=-0.1056; 95% CI=-0.1770,-0.0343) in FVC. SAT and TAT areas showed similar patterns.Conclusions:We report the first finding that abdominal adiposity intensifies the inverse relationship between air pollution and lung function. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

	abstract = {Background: Study of drug resistance of commensal bacteria in both humans and animals can determine the scale of the drug resistance problem. Usage of antimicrobials to treat infections in humans and animals has generated extensive antimicrobial pressure not only on targeted pathogens but also on commensal bacteria. Commensal Escherichia coli appears to be the major reservoir for resistant genes implicated in the transmission of genetic traits from one bacterium to another. Antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae has increased dramatically worldwide in the last decade. An increasing number of community-onset extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacterial infections, especially those caused by ESBL-producing E. coli, have been reported in many countries, including Thailand. Moreover, ESBL-producing E. coli have been widely detected in food-producing animals and the environment. The increased use of ESBLs in food animals is a serious public health problem. The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance pattern of ESBL-producing E. coli isolated from pigs, layers, farm workers and stagnant water, in order to increase awareness about antimicrobial usage on farms and to minimize the expansion of the antimicrobial resistance phenomenon in farm settings. Materials, Methods & Results: A total of 588 samples were collected from 107 pig farms and 89 layer farms in Chiang Mai-Lamphun and Chon Buri provinces during May 2015-April 2016. Double-disk diffusion method according to EUCAST (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) guidelines was used for detection. The results demonstrated that 36.7% (216/588) of samples were ESBL-producing E. coli-positive, including rectal swabs 74.8% (80/107), pig farm worker stool swabs 57.0% (61/107), stagnant water on pig farms 21.5% (23/107), healthy layer rectal swabs 6.7% (6/89) and layer farm worker stool swabs 51.7% (46/89). Most of the isolates were resistant against ampicillin (99.5%), followed by erythromycin (98.6%) and ceftriaxone (96.3%). All of them were classified as multidrug-resistant strains. Moreover, AMP-CRO-E-TE-C-SXT-CN was the most frequent phenotype pattern detected in animals, humans and the environment, followed by AMP-CRO-E-TE-C-SXT-NA-CN. Discussion: The present study offers clear evidence that the prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli in healthy pigs is higher than in layers. One possible explanation is that a large amount and variety of antimicrobials are used on pig farms, resulting in a common and significant source of drug-resistant ESBL-producing E. coli. The lower incidence of ESBL-producing E. coli in samples from a pig farm environment than in samples of animal origin indicate that pigs are a reservoir of a reservoir for resistant bacteria and a source of environmental contamination. Antimicrobial resistance patterns of ESBLproducing E. coli detected in all sample types and study locations were quite similar. In almost all ESBL-producing E. coli isolates, resistance was shown against ampicillin, erythromycin, ceftriaxone, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Moreover, multidrug resistance was found in all isolates of ESBL-producing E. coli. The differences in antimicrobial agent resistance patterns can be used to differentiate sources by employing analytical tools such as discriminant function analysis. A molecular typing protocol is recommended for use in a discriminant function analysis for pattern determination of pathogen spreading. However, genetic fingerprinting techniques for microbial source tracking are more expensive, and facilities with appropriate equipment and expertise are required. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the supplementation and aging in the gluteus biceps and triceps brachii muscles of lamb. Forty-eight Santa Inês lambs, with 15 kg average initial weight were slaughtered at 32 kg average final weight, after five months of supplementation. Twenty-four animals were allocated to sixteen pastures with residual leaf area index (2.6) and unsupplemented, the other twenty-four animals were allocated to the same conditions but were supplemented. The treatments were cross factorial between rLAI (2.6) and supplemented or not, totalizing 8 treatments. In this experiment, the slaughter criterion was the age of the animals. In the gluteus biceps and triceps brachii muscles, storage for seven days increased lipid oxidation. The values of cooking loss and water holding capacity increased with time of aging and were higher in the gluteus biceps, by 29.40% and 71.30%, respectively. The supplementation implies an increase in production costs, but its use provides the quantitative and qualitative characteristics favorable to the product, aiming to satisfy the consumer market. The supplementation decreased the shelf life, increasing the lipid oxidation during time of aging and affected the lightness and the hue of yellow, which may sffect consumers’ intention to purchase. © 2018, University of Zagreb, Facultty of Veterinary Medicine.

The scientific objectives of this project are (i) to broaden the genetic base of legume crops, (ii) to analyse the genetic diversity of European and Chinese legume accessions using phenotypic traits (yield, quality in a context of climate change) and molecular markers, (iii) to analyse the genetic architecture of key breeding traits using association genetics (GWAS) and (iv) to evaluate the benefits brought by genomic selection (GS) to create new legume varieties. Comprehensive searchable databases containing passport data, as well as agronomic and genetic features will be developed.

	abstract = {The genetics of tick infestation in sheep need study, as host resistance often forms part of integrated pest control programs. Repeated udder health scores, site-specific tick count, mating weight and reproduction records (N = 879–1204) were recorded annually from 2010 to 2015 on ewes of the indigenous Namaqua Afrikaner (NA) fat-tailed breed, as well as the commercial Dorper and SA Mutton Merino (SAMM) breeds. Udders were scored subjectively on a 1–5 scale (1 – udder intact and 5 – udder damaged severely) and ticks were counted on three locations. The body sites counted were the head and thoracic limb (HTLTC), udder-pelvic limb (UPLTC) and perineum-breech-tail (PBTTC). These counts were also totaled for a total tick count (TTC). Reproduction traits were number of lambs weaned per ewe lambed and total weight of lamb weaned per ewe lambed. Udder health scores of NA ewes were lower than those of Dorpers, which in turn had lower scores than SAMM ewes. NA ewes had lower values for HTLTC, UPLTC and TTC than the commercial breeds, but higher values for PBTTC than Dorpers. Heritability estimates amounted to 0.26 ± 0.04 for HTLTC, 0.53 ± 0.04 for UPLTC, 0.07 ± 0.06 for PBTTC, 0.44 ± 0.06 for TTC and 0.61 ± 0.03 for udder health score. Animal permanent environment also affected PBTTC (0.14 ± 0.07). Significant genetic correlations were found between the HTLTC and UPLTC (0.47 ± 0.10), UPLTC and udder health score (0.52 ± 0.07), HTLTC and UPLTC (0.24 ± 0.11) as well as UPLTC and PBTTC (−0.44 ± 0.11). Heavier ewes had higher UPLTC (0.38 ± 0.09), TTC (0.33 ± 0.09) and impaired udder health (0.21 ± 0.08). Udder health scores and tick counts at all sites were not related to reproduction traits. The indigenous NA breed outperformed the commercial breeds with lower values for HTLTC, UPLTC, TTC and a better udder health score. Mechanisms contributing to the better performance of the NA breed under pastoral conditions and the scope for selection for tick tolerance within breeds should be studied further. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The invasion and range expansion of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) in North America represents an outstanding opportunity to study processes of invasion, range expansion, and climatic adaptation. Furthermore, knowledge obtained from such research is relevant to developing novel strategies to control this important vector species. Substantial evidence indicates that the photoperiodic diapause response is an important adaptation to climatic variation across the range of Ae. albopictus in North America. Photoperiodic diapause is a key determinant of abundance in both space and time, and the timing of entry into and exit out of diapause strongly affects seasonal population dynamics and thus the potential for arbovirus transmission. Emerging genomic technologies are making it possible to develop high-resolution, genome-wide genetic markers that can be used for genetic mapping of traits relevant to disease transmission and phylogeographic studies to elucidate invasion history. Recent work using next-generation sequencing technologies (e.g., RNA-seq), combined with physiological experiments, has provided extensive insight into the transcriptional basis of the diapause response in Ae. albopictus. Applying this knowledge to identify novel targets for vector control represents an important future challenge. Finally, recent studies have begun to identify traits other than diapause that are affected by photoperiodism. Extending this work to identify additional traits influenced by photoperiod should produce important insights into the seasonal biology of Ae. albopictus. © The Authors 2016.

The results revealed highly significant correlation between diameter and area of heartwood in southern zone (r = 0.86) and western zone (r = 0.91). There was no significant correlation between wood density and diametrical growth in both the zones. There was significant positive correlation between tree height and heartwood area. The result indicates that faster growth is associated with higher heartwood content and lower sapwood proportion disproving the general notion that faster-grown trees will always have greater sapwood content. This affirms that the heartwood production in the teak plantations is predictable from diameter measurement. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017. All rights reserved.},

Awareness of haematuria as the major presenting symptom is paramount, and early diagnosis with individualised treatment and follow-up is the key to a successful outcome. For non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the mainstay of treatment is complete resection of the tumour followed by induction and maintenance immunotherapy with intravesical BCG vaccine or intravesical chemotherapy. For muscle-invasive bladder cancer, multimodal treatment involving radical cystectomy with neoadjuvant chemotherapy offers the best chance for cure. Selected patients with muscle-invasive tumours can be offered bladder-sparing trimodality treatment consisting of transurethral resection with chemoradiation. Advanced disease is best treated with systemic cisplatin-based chemotherapy; immunotherapy is emerging as a viable salvage treatment for patients in whom first-line chemotherapy cannot control the disease.

	abstract = {Pygidiopsis macrostomum and Ascocotyle (Phagicola) pindoramensis (Digenea: Heterophyidae) parasitize guppies as intermediate hosts and, respectively, fish-eating mammals or birds as definitive hosts. Heterophyids have zoonotic potential, and molecular studies associated with morphological and ecological aspects have helped to clarify their taxonomy and phylogeny. Poecilia vivipara naturally parasitized by metacercariae of both species (100% prevalence) exhibit no external signs of parasitism. In this work, four new sequences of P. macrostomum (18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and ITS2 rDNA) and one new sequence of A. (P.) pindoramensis (mtDNA cox-1) are presented. Phylogeny reconstructions linked P. macrostomum to other heterophyids, but the separation of the Heterophyidae and Opisthorchiidae remains unclear. Additionally, we used indirect immunocytochemistry and the phalloidin-fluorescence techniques allied with confocal laser scanning microscopy to describe muscular and neuronal structures of P. macrostomum. A complex arrangement of muscular fibres is associated with the tegument, suckers, gut and reproductive system. Radial fibres around the ventral sucker are thick, branched and extend to the body wall. High-resolution confocal imaging revealed a typical digenean muscular arrangement and important heterophyid morphological traits. These data will support future control measures to reduce the parasitism in guppies reared in fish farming systems, especially for aquarium and experimental purposes. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Cancer development is a multistep process which results in the acquisition of a number of hallmark traits that are common to all cancers, namely sustained proliferative signaling, insensitivity to growth suppressors, resistance to apoptosis, replicative immortality, induction of angiogenesis, activation of invasion and metastasis, reprogrammed energy metabolism, and ability to evade immune control (Hanahan and Weinberg 2011). At the end of 1999, the term of vasculogenic mimicry (VM) was introduced to describe the unique ability of highly aggressive tumor cells to express a multipotent, stem cell-like phenotype and to form vessel-like networks without participation of endothelial cells. VM serves as an alternative mechanism through which tumor cells can obtain nutrients to survive, especially in the less vascularized areas of the tumor. VM has been observed in carcinomas and sarcomas, and its occurrence has been repeatedly demonstrated to have an exceptionally tight association with metastatic cancer-related mortality. Of special significance is the resistance of tumor cell VM to angiogenesis inhibitors, suggesting that VM is a way for tumors to develop insensitivity to this class of anticancer drugs. In this review, we discuss the clinical significance of VM. We discuss the experimental evidence that VM blockade in experimental lung, breast, colon, cervical cancer and melanoma mouse models can reduce tumor growth rate by 80-90%. We also report that the selective low molecular VM inhibitor, LCS1269, restores the sensitivity of resistant melanoma cells to DNA-damaging agents. Finally, we focus on education of non-cancer cells towards VM by aggressive melanoma. In light of these observations, we suggest that VM might be considered as yet another hallmark of aggressive tumor. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {Creating farms for sable breeding was associated with the commercial destruction of natural populations and, consequently, the overall decline in the species number. The gene pool of the first farm-bred sable population in Russia, established in the vicinity of Moscow (“Pushkinskiy” fur farm), was formed by crossing of animals removed from nine natural populations. In the first eight years of farm operation, approximately one thousand animals were used for sable breeding; some of these animals were able to adapt to the farm management and, subsequently, to the selection for a number of quantitative traits in the period of industrial domestication. It took about ten years for breeders to work out the breeding and selection technologies, which became successfully employed in the established affiliated sable breeding farms. The main achievement in sable breeding over the 85-year historical period of breeding in Russia is the creation of two unique breeds, black sable (1969) and Saltykovskaya 1 (2007). In general, industrial domestication in fur farming and the subsequent breeding works made the fur of many species (mink, fox, Arctic fox) obtained from natural populations uncompetitive, which undoubtedly reduced the hunting interest in the animals living in the wild. Consequently, hunting for fur-bearing animals of most species decreased and has only local importance. Owing to the specific features of sable biology, the fur of farm-bred animals cannot yet completely replace the furs obtained by hunting; however, the farm-bred sable population is constantly growing. This review presents the results of the analysis of the level of genetic variability in natural and farm populations at nuclear and mitochondrial loci. The comparative analysis makes it possible to estimate the loss of genetic diversity upon the species adaptation to the new conditions of existence.},

	abstract = {Chordomas are rare tumors of the spine and skull base that are locally destructive and resistant to chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Chordoma patients have a long life expectancy with high mortality from the disease. Cancer stem cells, which are known to exist in chordomas, have extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential and are responsible for maintaining tumor heterogeneity along with chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has multiple functions in stem cell biology, the immune response, and cancer, and is potentially a key molecule that allows cancer stem cells to self-renew. The purpose of this study was to determine whether LIF increases the aggressive traits of chordoma cells and leads to a poor prognosis in patients. Chordoma cell lines were treated with LIF, and functional tests were done. Twenty skull base chordoma samples were checked for levels of LIF and a correlation with clinicopathological features. The whole transcriptome microarray was used to observe changes in gene expression. We observed increased migration, invasion, tumorosphere formation, colony formation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance accompanied by a dramatic elevation in inflammatory gene networks and pathways in chordomas. The expression of LIF was associated with tumor size and a poorer overall survival. Microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assessments suggest that LIF can facilitate tumor-promoting inflammation. Results indicate that LIF plays a role in maintaining cancer stem cells in chordomas. Copyright © 2017 Cognizant, LLC.},

	abstract = {We conducted 30-and 60-d greenhouse experiments to compare functional traits of Bromus tectorum (invasive annual grass) and four perennial bunchgrasses under well-watered or drought conditions. Even under drought, B. tectorum experienced significantly less stress (i.e., higher xylem pressure potential and greater shoot water content, water use per day and water-use efficiency) and biomass production than the perennial grasses after 30 d. However, after 60 d, its superiority was reduced under infrequent watering. Differences among perennial grasses were more pronounced for physiological traits under infrequent watering and for morphological traits under frequent watering. Elymus multisetus (fastgrowing species) had a higher transpiration rate, lower leaf temperature, and lower water-use efficiency than the other grasses after 30 d. In contrast, Pseudoroegneria spicata (slow-growing) had lower xylem pressure potential and higher leaf temperature than all other grasses under infrequent watering. Under frequent watering, shoot dry mass and specific leaf area of B. tectorum was matched by Elymus wawawaiensis (moderate-growing species). Our results indicate that multiple-species plantings or seedings are necessary to foster greater weed resistance against B. tectorum. We also emphasize that when choosing plant material for restoration, performance during both pulse (resource-rich) and inter-pulse (resource-poor) periods should be considered. © The Author(s) 2017.},

Opuntia (prickly pear cactus) is one of the most widespread and naturalized in the arid and semi-arid areas of Kenya, with extreme effects on rural livelihoods and the environment. However, comprehensive information on the status of invasion in the country is lacking, which is crucial for developing strategies for prevention and management. This paper, therefore, provides an overview of the interacting factors that influence its invasion in Kenya in terms of species diversity, pathways of introduction, negative impacts and the effectiveness of regulations and control measures. Seven invasive species of Opuntia are present in the country with the most abundant (O. stricta) being under biocontrol trial. These species have the same habitat preferences, physiological traits, negative impacts, introduction pathways and management options. Invasion is mainly attributed to changes in land use and consequent land degradation. Introduction pathways are largely intentional for ornamental purposes but unintentional at a local scale through escape from gardens and natural dispersal. The most applied methods of managing Opuntia are mechanical and chemical methods that are unsustainable and labour-intensive at large scale. Effective policies are therefore needed to prevent an increase in the significant negative impacts caused by IAS including those that have a limited distribution. © CAB International 2018.},

A key aspect for the identification process resides in the preservation of human remains. Besides the conventional identification approaches employed, such as external traits, dental records, tattoos, and piercings, DNA profiling represents the gold standard of objective and reliable identification. DNA polymorphisms are used for tracing the kinship between fragmentary human remains and the relatives claiming them. DNA degradation and contamination characterize disaster areas and demand efficient strategies for reducing their analytical effects. Since the early 1990s, DNA-based victim identification technical approaches have evolved vertiginously. In this chapter two terrorist attacks and a mass murder case conducted by state terrorism during the last military dictatorship in Buenos Aires, Argentina, are described. Other disasters are also described, including open road accidents involving buses crashing and burning, an open road airplane disaster, and a closed accident in an in-flight airplane explosion. The evolution of the technical approaches are analyzed, showing how forensic genetics and genomics promote a paradigm change driven by technology that highly improves the victim identification process based in DNA typing in mass fatalities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: The proliferation, migration and invasion capabilities of HBE-Dp71d and HBE-Dp71f cells were evaluated by MTT, colony formation, transwell and scratch assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis induced by H                             2                             O                             2                              were measured by flow cytometer. Co-IP was performed to prove the interaction between lamin B1, FAK and Dp71. Western blot was performed to detect lamin B1, FAK, ERK and Cyclin D expression in HBE-Dp71d and HBE-Dp71f cells. Results: HBE-Dp71d and HBE-Dp71f cells proliferated faster than their mock and blank controls; shortened their G0/G1 phase; enhanced their invasion and migration capabilities; reduced their apoptosis induced by H                             2                             O                             2                             . Co-IP proved Dp71 directly interacting with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and lamin B1 in HBE cells. Increased lamin B1, FAK mRNA and protein expression, over activation of integrin/focal adhesion kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/cyclin D pathway were observed in HBE-Dp71d and HBE-Dp71f cells. Conclusions: Via increasing FAK in the cytoplasmic FAK-Dp71, lamin B1 of nucleus laminB1-Dp71 complex, HBE-Dp71d and HBE-Dp71f cells alter their proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle and apoptosis rate induced by H                             2                             O                             2                             .                          © 2017 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Ricebean has been categorized as underutilized crop despite its nutritive quality and fodder yielding ability benign higher than other legumes of Vigna family. In addition to its nutritive value, this crop is fairly resistant to drought and flood conditions. The purpose of this paper is to provide important traits for direct selection of fodder yielding ricebean genotypes through analysis of phenotypic and genotypic association and path coefficient. In the present study, the degree of association between yield and yield contributing attributes were estimated in 85 germplasm lines for nineteen quantitative traits so that direct selection of the promising traits may be effective for the improvement of yield potential of future genotypes of ricebean. Correlation studies indicated that green fodder yield per plant was significantly and positively associated with green fodder yield per day, number of leaves per plant, number of branches per plant, crude protein yield per plant, crude protein yield per plant per day, dry matter yield per plant, dry matter yield per plant per day, leaf stem ratio and plant height at both genotypic and phenotypic levels. Path coefficient revealed that green fodder yield per plant per day has highest direct effect and significant positive correlation towards yield. Other traits, crude protein yield per plant, dry matter yield per plant per day, days to 50% flowering, days to flower initiation and plant height were also found to be important fodder yield indicators in ricebean. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

	abstract = {Plants are continuously exposed to a plethora of threats originating from different biotic and abiotic stressors, which have escalated over time due to change in global climate pattern as well as human interferences and the subject of stress is imperative in influencing plant growth and crop production all around the world. Diverse methods like use of plants with natural tolerance or plants with modified tolerance by use of stress-related genes are available for alleviation of such stresses. Nevertheless, the use of rhizospheric microorganisms having plant growth-promoting traits has also been proved to be effective under stressful conditions. Such microbes can symbiotically or non-symbiotically alleviate the effects of stress and enhance plant growth. Therefore, diverse microbial species and strains are isolated, screened, tested, and used as microbial inoculums worldwide. The vast influence of rhizospheric microbes toward the growth and production of crop plants can be environmentally and economically significant.

	abstract = {Salmonella Typhimurium infection via foodborne transmission remains a major public health threat even in developed countries. Vaccines have been developed to reduce the disease burden at the pre-harvest stage, but the cell-mediated immune response against intracellular invasion of the pathogen is not sufficiently elicited by conventional killed Salmonella vaccines, which are safer than live vaccines. In this study, we developed a genetically inactivated vaccine candidate by introducing lysis plasmid pJHL454 harboring the λ phage holin-endolysin system into S. Typhimurium; we designated this vaccine JOL1950. In vitro expression of endolysin was validated by immunoblotting, and complete inactivation of JOL1950 cells was observed following 36 h of the lysis. Electron microscopic examinations by scanning electron microscopy and immunogold labeling transmission EM revealed conserved surface antigenic traits of the JOL1950 cells after lysis. An in vivo immunogenicity study in mice immunized with lysed cells showed significantly increased serum IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a levels. Further, we observed markedly increased in vitro cell proliferation and upregulation of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines in the repulsed splenic T-cells of immunized mice. In dendritic cells (DCs) treated with lysed JOL1950, we observed a significant increase in dendritic cell activation, co-stimulatory molecule production, and levels of immunomodulatory cytokines. In addition, Th1 and Th17 cytokines were also released by naïve CD4+ T-cells pulsed with primed DCs. Lysed JOL1950 also protected against lethal challenge in immunized mice. Together, these results indicate that our vaccine candidate has great potential to induce cell-mediated immunity against S. Typhimurium by facilitating the activation of DCs. © 2017 The Author(s).},

A total of 36 piglets (28 day) were randomly divided into three groups of four replicates of three animals in each. Each group was fed one of the experimental diet as basal diet alone (Control-T0); basal diet supplemented with Pediococcus acidilactici strain FT28 (swine origin probiotic-T1) and basal diet supplemented with Lactobacillus acidophilus NCDC-15 (dairy origin probiotic-T2). Increased (P < 0.05) level of serum total protein and albumin, and decreased (P < 0.05) triglyceride were observed with probiotic supplementation either of swine or dairy origin, compared to control. The level globulin and glucose were higher (P < 0.05) in T1 group among the dietary groups. Carcass traits remained unaltered except for the weight of ham, kidney and spleen which were higher (P < 0.05) in the T1 group. Water holding capacity and TBARS were improved (P < 0.05) in the T1 group than control, however comparable to the T2 group. The ether extract, pH and sensory attributes (juiciness and appearance) were improved (P < 0.05) in the T1 group among the dietary groups. It is evident from the present study that P. acidilactici FT28 could serve as probiotic for enhancing carcass quality and physicochemical properties of pork without influencing the blood metabolites. © 2017},

	abstract = {Mycoparasitism is a lifestyle where a living fungus (host or prey) is parasitized by and acts as a nutrient source of another fungus (mycoparasite or predator). Mycoparasitic interactions are common among fungi and, similar to plant pathogens, comprise both biotrophic as well as necrotrophic relationships. Biotrophic mycoparasites obtain their nutrition from living fungal host hyphae, with which they can live in a balanced relationship for extended stages of their life cycles, and usually show a narrow host range (1). Because of their nature, however, only few species are studied in detail and applied as biocontrol agents. Examples are Ampelomyces quisqualis (Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina), a natural enemy of powdery mildews, whose genome sequence has recently been released, as well as haustorial biotrophs from the Zygomycota (2, 3). In contrast to biotrophs, necrotrophic mycoparasites are more destructive and often rather unspecialized (4). They usually have wide host ranges, often comprising fungal plant pathogens, and kill their fungal prey by invasion and secretion of damaging molecules followed by feeding on the released nutrients (5, 6). These traits render these fungi useful in agriculture for the biological control of plant diseases. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Questionnaire is the most commonly applied patient-reported outcome measure used to assess disability and functioning in clinical research and practice for patients with injuries and diseases of the upper extremities. The objective of this study was to assess whether the DASH is a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure disability and functioning in patients with hand injuries and diseases using Rasch analysis. Methods: We performed a psychometric study using data derived from two multicentre studies carried out to develop the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Sets for Hand Conditions. We analysed the data of 417 patients recruited in a clinical setting and suffering from hand injuries (e.g. finger fracture, flexor tendon injury) or diseases (e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome, rhizarthrosis). We examined whether the DASH fulfilled the assumptions for its use as a measure by applying a partial credit model and testing for differential item functioning for sex and age. Results: Bifactor analysis revealed problems with the underlying latent trait of functioning and disability. Rasch analysis raised further issues, including disordered thresholds for eight items and misfit in nine items. One item showed Differential Item Functioning for sex. Conclusion: The study reveals that some DASH items do not fit the underlying trait that the DASH aims to measure. Further studies using Rasch analysis are needed to compare our findings with results of studies involving other target groups (e.g. patients with injuries of the upper arm and shoulder). © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Knowledge of thermal acclimation of physiological processes of boreal tree species is necessary to determine their ability to adapt to predicted global warming and reduce the uncertainty around the anticipated feedbacks of forest ecosystems and global carbon cycle to climate change. The objective of this work was to examine the extent of thermal acclimation of net photosynthesis (An) and dark respiration (Rd) of two distant white spruce (Picea glauca) seed sources (from south and north of the commerial forest zone in Quebec) in response to latitudinal and seasonal variations in growing conditions. Methods The temperature responses of An, its biochemical and biophysical limitations, and Rd were measured in 1-year-old needles of seedlings from the seed sources growing in eight forest plantations along a regional thermal gradient of 5.5°C in Quebec, Canada. Key Results The average optimum temperature (Topt) for An was 19 ± 1.2°C and was similar among seed sources and plantation sites along the thermal gradient. Net photosynthesis at Topt (Aopt) varied significantly among plantation sites and was quadratically related to the mean July temperature (MJT) of plantation sites. Topt for mesophyll conductance, maximum electron transport rate and maximum rate of carboxylation were 28, 22 and 30°C, respectively. Basal respiration rate (Rd at 10°C) was linearly and negatively associated with MJT. Q10 of Rd (the rate of change in Rd with a 10°C increase in temperature) did not show any significant relationship with MJT and averaged 1.5 ± 0.1. The two seed sources were similar in their thermal responses to latitudinal and seasonal variations in growing conditions. Conclusions The results showed moderate thermal acclimation of respiration and no evidence for thermal acclimation of photosynthesis or local genetic adaptation for traits related to thermal acclimation. Therefore, growth of local white spruces may decline in future climates. © 2018 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Deoni cattle is one of the most important cattle breeds found in most drought prone region of the country i.e. Marathwada region of western India. In the present study, an attempt was made to explore this drought resistant breed for its genetic improvements and further research. Recently, the state animal husbandry department along with National Dairy Development Board of India has started registration of Deoni cattle in Information Network for Animal Productivity and Health (INAPH) for performance recording of this animal. It is found in three colour variations, viz. Wanera (clear white with black colour at both the sides of the face), Balankya (clear white colour body) and Shevera (white body with irregular black spots). The productive and reproductive traits of Deoni cows were studied by different workers and revealed that the average lactation milk yield varies from 238.86±76.0 kg to 868.24±49.56 kg, average lactation length varies from 149.43±33.52 days to 293.3±2.9 days, dry period varies from 103.66±19.78 days to 282.77±12.85 days, average daily milk yield ranges from 2.17±0.07 kg to 2.91±0.05 kg, the peak yield was observed to be 4.58 kg, age at first calving ranges from 1070.80±17.17 days to 1533 days, inter-calving period ranges from 447.0±8.0 days to 566.109±13.639 days and service period ranges from 152.14 ± 15.08 days to 286.57±13.38 days. It is imperative to conduct the genetic study on stress related genes like ATPA1, heat shock protein gene and disease resistance genes should be studied in Deoni cattle as it is predominantly found in drought prone region of the country. Due to non-availability of superior breeding bulls and increased homozygosity, this breed is suffering from problems of partial albinism.},

	abstract = {A preliminary genome sequence has been assembled for the Southern Ocean salp, Salpa thompsoni (Urochordata, Thaliacea).Despite the ecological importance of this species in Antarctic pelagic food webs and its potential role as an indicator of changing Southern Ocean ecosystems in response to climate change, no genomic resources are available for S. thompsoni or any closely related urochordate species. Using a multiple-platform,multiple-individual approach,we have produced a 318,767,936-bp genome sequence, covering>50%of the estimated 602Mb(±173 Mb) genome size for S. thompsoni.Using a nonredundant set of predicted proteins, >50% (16,823) of sequences showed significant homology to known proteins and ~38%(12,151) of the total protein predictions wereassociated withGeneOntology functional information.We havegenerated109,958SNP variant and9,782indelpredictions for this species, serving as a resource for future phylogenomic and population genetic studies. Comparing the salp genome to available assemblies for four other urochordates, Botryllus schlosseri, Ciona intestinalis, Ciona savignyi and Oikopleura dioica,we found that S. thompsoni shares the previously estimated rapid rates of evolution for these species. High mutation rates are thus independent of genome size, suggesting that rates of evolution>1.5 times that observed for vertebrates are a broad taxonomic characteristic of urochordates. Tests for positive selection implemented in PAML revealed a small number of genes with sites undergoing rapid evolution, including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and metabolic and immune process that may be reflective of both adaptation to polar, planktonic environments as well as the complex life history of the salps. Finally, we performed an initial survey of small RNAs, revealing the presence of known, conserved miRNAs, as well as novel miRNA genes; unique piRNAs; and maturemiRNAsignatures for varyingdevelopmental stages.Collectively, these resources provide agenomic foundation supporting S. thompsoni as a model species for further examination of the exceptional rates and patterns of genomic evolution shown by urochordates. Additionally, genomic data will allow for the development of molecular indicators of key life history events and processes and afford new understandings and predictions of impacts of climate change on this key species of Antarctic pelagic ecosystems. © The Author 2016.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that populations and species occupying different environments vary in their thermal tolerance traits. However, far less attention has been given to the impact of different environments on the capacity for plastic adjustments in thermal sensitivity, i.e., acclimation ability. One hypothesis is that environments characterized by greater thermal variability and seasonality should favor the evolution of increased acclimation ability compared with environments that are aseasonal or thermally stable. Additionally, organisms under selection for high heat tolerance may experience a trade-off and lose acclimation ability. Few studies have tested these non-mutually exclusive hypotheses at both broad latitudinal and local elevation scales in phylogenetically paired taxa. Here, we measure short-term acclimation ability of the critical thermal maximum (CTMAX) in closely related temperate and tropical mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and stoneflies (Plecoptera) from mountain streams at different elevations. We found that stream temperature was a good predictor of acclimation ability in mayflies, but not in stoneflies. Specifically, tropical mayflies showed reduced acclimation ability compared with their temperate counterparts. High elevation tropical mayflies had greater acclimation ability than low elevation mayflies, which reflected the wider temperature variation experienced in high elevation streams. In contrast, temperate and tropical stoneflies exhibited similar acclimation responses. We found no evidence for a trade-off between heat tolerance and acclimation ability in either taxonomic order. The acclimation response in stoneflies may reflect their temperate origin or foraging mode. In combination with previous studies showing tropical taxa have narrower thermal breadths, these results demonstrate that many lower elevation tropical aquatic insects are more vulnerable to climate warming than their temperate relatives. © The Author 2017.},

	abstract = {Few studies have quantified the relative importance of direct effects of climate change on communities versus indirect effects that are mediated thorough species interactions, and the limited evidence is conflicting. Trait-based approaches have been popular in studies of climate change, but can they be used to estimate direct versus indirect effects? At the species level, thermal tolerance is a trait that is often used to predict winners and losers under scenarios of climate change. But thermal tolerance might also inform when species interactions are likely to be important because only subsets of species will be able to exploit the available warmer climatic niche space, and competition may intensify in the remaining, compressed cooler climatic niche space. Here, we explore the relative roles of the direct effects of temperature change and indirect effects of species interactions on forest ant communities that were heated as part of a large-scale climate manipulation at high-A nd low-latitude sites in eastern North America. Overall, we found mixed support for the importance of negative species interactions (competition), but found that the magnitude of these interaction effects was predictable based on the heat tolerance of the focal species. Forager abundance and nest site occupancy of heat-intolerant species were more often influenced by negative interactions with other species than by direct effects of temperature. Our findings suggest that measures of species-specific heat tolerance may roughly predict when species interactions will influence responses to global climate change. © 2017 The Author.},

	abstract = {The aim of the study was to compare and research: the general prevalence of DM in the Sumy region compared with the prevalence of DM in the whole of Ukraine during the years 2011-2016; the prevalence of ocular complications of diabetes and their tendency to progress in Ukraine and Sumy region over this period; various demographical traits of the prevalence of ocular complications of diabetes and the dependence of prevalence of ocular complications of diabetes upon environmental causes and various socio-economic factors. We conducted a statistical analysis of data on diabetes and its complications in the whole of Ukraine and the Sumy region. The materials that were analyzed were collected over the last 6 years from the Department of Endocrine diseases of the Regional Hospital of Sumy. In addition materials were collected from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) presented by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (University of Washington, Seattle). In this work we have shown an increase of 17.5% in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the Sumy region during the period 2011 - 2016. During that period there was no significant change in the prevalence of DM in the whole of Ukraine. The prevalence of ocular complications of DM are approximately 22% of which 6% for DC and 16% for DR. The prevalence of ocular complications did not change over the years. We have shown that the increase of DM prevalence is in accordance with severe increase in environmental pollution. In addition we have shown that there is a process of the population moving from the villages to the towns - a process which invites negative change in life style leading to higher prevalence of DM. We plan in the future to look in detail into the question of ground water pollution and research whether the drinking water is polluted in a way that it may affect the increased prevalence of DM.},

	abstract = {Background: Malaria parasite species differ greatly in the harm they do to humans. While P. falciparum kills hundreds of thousands per year, P. vivax kills much less often and P. malariae is relatively benign. Strains of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium chabaudi show phenotypic variation in virulence during infections of laboratory mice. This make it an excellent species to study genes which may be responsible for this trait. By understanding the mechanisms which underlie differences in virulence we can learn how parasites adapt to their hosts and how we might prevent disease. Methods: Here we present a complete reference genome sequence for a more virulent P. chabaudi strain, PcCB, and perform a detailed comparison with the genome of the less virulent PcAS strain. Results: We found the greatest variation in the subtelomeric regions, in particular amongst the sequences of the pir gene family, which has been associated with virulence and establishment of chronic infection. Despite substantial variation at the sequence level, the repertoire of these genes has been largely maintained, highlighting the requirement for functional conservation as well as diversification in host-parasite interactions. However, a subset of pir genes, previously associated with increased virulence, were more highly expressed in PcCB, suggesting a role for this gene family in virulence differences between strains. We found that core genes involved in red blood cell invasion have been under positive selection and that the more virulent strain has a greater preference for reticulocytes, which has elsewhere been associated with increased virulence. Conclusions: These results provide the basis for a mechanistic understanding of the phenotypic differences between Plasmodium chabaudi strains, which might ultimately be translated into a better understanding of malaria parasites affecting humans. © 2018 Lin Jw et al.},

While ethnicity measures both the individual genetic ancestry and cultural traits shared within a group, geographic location reflects the macroenvironment to which individuals are exposed during their daily life. Examination of ethnicity and geographic location will allow us to gain an insight into how genes and culture interacting with ecological factors affect the development of cancer in humans. This chapter provides an overview of the distribution of cancer incidence or mortality by ethnicity and geographic location in the United States, and specific risk factors for lung cancer, which is one of the most common causes of cancer death consistently across different ethnic groups. Because Asian countries such as China may have a different pattern of human cancer from the more developed world, the most common cancers and related risk factors in China are also discussed. Finally, a brief summary of cancer risk factors, including environmental exposures, infectious agents and psychosocial stressors, and their potential mechanisms and potential dietary interventions and chemopreventive agents are described. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Observations on ionic response to salinity and net fluxes of K+, Na+ in the root exhibited by plants during salt stress have highlighted the need for further investigation. The objectives of this study were to compare salt adaptation of two Chinese Iris (Iris lactea Pall. var. chinensis (Fisch.) Koidz.) populations, and to improve understanding of adaptation to salinity exhibited by plants. Plants used in this study were grown from seeds collected in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xj) and Beijing Municipality (Bj), China. Hydroponicallygrown seedlings of the two populations were supplied with nutrient solutions containing 0.1 (control) and 140 mmol·L-1 NaCl. After 12 days, plants were harvested for determination of relative growth rate and K+, Na+ concentrations. Net fluxes of K+, Na+ from the apex and along the root axis to 10.8 mm were measured using noninvasive micro-test technique. With 140 mmol·L-1 NaCl treatment, shoots for population Xj had larger relative growth rate and higher K+ concentration than shoots for population Bj. However, the Na+ concentrations in both shoots and roots were lower for Xj than those for Bj. There was a lower net efflux of K+ found in population Xj than by Bj in the mature zone (approximately 2.4-10.8 mm from root tip). However, no difference in the efflux of Na+ between the populations was obtained. Population Xj of I. lactea continued to grow normally under NaCl stress, and maintained a higher K+/Na+ ratio in the shoots. These traits, which were associated with lower K+ leakage, help population Xj adapt to saline environments. © The Author(s) 2014.},

	abstract = {Pituitary adenomas have been associated with multiple co-morbidities, including neuropsychiatric disorders. The overall perceived prevalence and severity of cognitive dysfunction were the highest among Non-Functional Pituitary Adenomas (NFPA) groups, particularly in the areas of mental agility, verbal recall, and memory recall. The main psychiatric symptom of hypopituitarism is a combination of dementia and delirium. However, the most common neurologic symptoms are headaches and visual changes. Thirty-three to seventy-two percent of pituitary adenomas, independently of their dimensions, induce headache. Non-functional pituitary adenomas tend to affect visual acuity more than adenomas with other pathological diagnoses, which produce either adrenocorticotropic hormone or prolactin. Visual Field defects occurred in 95% of patients with non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma. The above neurologic symptoms are more common in nonfunctioning adenomas but also in gonadotroph adenomas because these tumors do not secrete sufficient hormones to cause endocrine-type symptoms. ACTH-secreting adenomas causing Cushing Disease cause significant morbidity. Carpal tunnel syndrome, obstructive sleeping apnea and headache are typical neurological features in somatotroph adenomas. Pain appears to be a frequent problem in pituitary disease. The data suggest that pain should be integrated in the diagnostic and therapeutic work-up of patients with pituitary disease in order to treat them appropriately and improve their Quality of Life (QoL). Meningitis is an unusual complication of untreated invasive pituitary adenomas and represents the initial symptom leading to diagnosis of a macroadenoma in exceptional cases. If the adenoma expands laterally into the cavernous sinus, it has the potential to affect the cranial nerves housed there, including cranial nerves III (oculomotor), IV (trochlear), VI (abducens), thus causing diplopia. Other neurologic presentations, such as cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, seizures, and pituitary apoplexy, can occur but are uncommon. Other uncommon symptoms are hoarse voice, acute respiratory distress due to unilateral larynx paralysis and myopathy. Prolactin-secreting pituitary adenomas (PRL-omas) are well-differentiated endocrine tumors expressing D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2). DRD2 polymorphisms correlate with psychiatric disorders, in particular alcoholism and schizophrenia. Compared with healthy controls, acromegalic patients described themselves as distinctly more harm avoidant and neurotic and presented themselves with high social conformity. However, specific for patients with GH-producing adenomas was an even more reduced novelty-seeking behavior, especially in terms of lower impulsiveness, compared with patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas. Patients with pituitary adenomas show a distinct pattern of increased anxiety-related personality traits compared with the general population, potentially as a result of the pituitary lesion and/or associated hormonal dysregulations and comorbidities. In conclusion many neurological and psychiatric symptoms can accompany pituitary adenomas. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The bermudagrass was managed under four N treatments (0; 100; 150 and 200 kg ha-1) using a completely randomized experimental design, with four repetitions. Twenty six days after a standardization cut, four canopy traits were determined: leaf area index (LAI), aerial dry mass (ADM), green coverage index (GCI), using a RGB camera and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), using a multispectral camera. All the traits responded positively to nitrogen fertilization. However, while the GCI showed curvilinear relationships with LAI (R2=0.89) and ADM (R2=0.87), the NDVI showed linear relationships with both (r2 LAI=0.62; r2 ADM=0.64) without evidences of saturated responses.

	abstract = {Thioglycosides are among the most popular glycosyl donors for the formation of interglycosidic linkages.1 This popularity stems from the fact that the anomeric thiofunction is stable to most conditions used for protection and functional group manipulations. When treated with an appropriate electrophile, the anomeric thiofunction can be activated to provide a glycosylating species. The stability of thioglycosides, particularly to Lewis acids, has put them at the heart of several sequential glycosylation strategies.2 They can be employed in an orthogonal condensation sequence in which they are combined with other glycosyl donors such as anomeric -uorides and imidates. Alternatively, the difference in reactivity of differentially functionalized thioglycosides can be exploited in a chemoselective glycosylation strategy. Recently, iterative glycosylation procedures have been introduced, 2 which are based on the preactivation of thioglycosidic donors. In a preactivation protocol, the thioglycoside donor is transformed into a reactive glycosylating species before the addition of the appropriate acceptor, which in turn can be a second thioglycoside. In 2001, Crich and coworkers introduced the 1-benzenesulfinyl piperidine (BSP, 1a)-tri-uoromethanesulfonic anhydride (2) (Tf2O) reagent for the (pre-)activation of thioglycosides, which has become a popular thiophilic activating system.3 Subsequently, our laboratory introduced the analogous diphenylsulfoxide (Ph2SO, 1b)-tri-ic anhydride (2) combination.4 This reagent couple was originally developed by Gin and coworkers for the activation of 1-hydroxyl donors, 3b, 5 and we applied it for the activation of disarmed thioglycosides.4 BSP and Ph2SO are commercially available at €3.3/mmol and €0.23/mmol, respectively. Although the sulfonium bis-tri-ate systems 3a and 3b are rather similar in reactivity, 6 the latter is a stronger electrophile and has been shown to activate thioglycosides, which were not reactive enough toward sulfonium tri--ate 3a.4, 7 The Ph2SO-Tf2O reagent combination (3b) has been used in condensation reactions of a variety of thioglycosidic donors, including several uronate esters8 and sialic acids.7a, d Activator 3b can also be used in an iterative glycosylation sequence combining 1-hydroxyl donors and thioglycosides.9 Furthermore, 3b is effective in the stereoselective construction of the challenging β-mannosidic bond using Crich’s benzylidene mannose system6, 7b, c or mannuronate ester donors as recently disclosed by our laboratory.10 The opening scheme of this chapter depicts a representative example in which mannuronate ester 4 is preactivated by treatment with diphenylsulfonium bis(tri-ate) 3b and subsequently coupled to glucoside (5) to provide the β-linked disaccharide 6 in 94% yield. © 2012 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The EFSA performs environmental risk assessment (ERA) for single potential stressors such as plant protection products, genetically modified organisms and feed additives, and for invasive alien species that are harmful to plant health. This ERA focusses primarily on the use or spread of such potential stressors in an agricultural context, but also considers the impact on the wider environment. It is important to realise that the above potential stressors in most cases contribute a minor proportion of the total integrated pressure that ecosystems experience. The World Wildlife Fund listed the relative attribution of threats contributing to the declines in animal populations as follows: 37% from exploitation (fishing, hunting, etc.), 31% habitat degradation and change, 13% from habitat loss, 7% from climate change, and only 5% from invasive species, 4% from pollution and 2% from disease. In this scientific opinion, the Scientific Committee gathered scientific knowledge on the extent of coverage of endangered species in current ERA schemes that fall under the remit of EFSA. The legal basis and the relevant ecological and biological features used to classify a species as endangered are investigated. The characteristics that determine vulnerability of endangered species are reviewed. Whether endangered species are more at risk from exposure to potential stressors than other nontarget species is discussed, but specific protection goals for endangered species are not given. Due to a lack of effect and exposure data for the vast majority of endangered species, the reliability of using data from other species is a key issue for their ERA. This issue and other uncertainties are discussed when reviewing the coverage of endangered species in current ERA schemes. Potential tools, such as population and landscape modelling and trait-based approaches, for extending the coverage of endangered species in current ERA schemes, are explored and reported. © 2016 European Food Safety Authority},

	abstract = {Compared with single nodular liver cancer, the prominent biological characteristics of multinodular liver cancer include rapid progression and short survival. Here, we developed a multinodular liver cancer model in mice and assessed the biological characteristics of the resulting neoplasms. H22 hepatoma cells at a dose of 2×105/mouse, suspended in 1.6 mL, 0.8 mL, or 200 μL saline were injected via the tail vein of BALB/c mice at a velocity of 200 μL per second. The mice were sacrificed at different time points after injection. And at the time of death the liver, lungs, spleen, kidneys and heart were removed for morphological study. The biological characteristics of the tumor nodules were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. In the mice treated with a large volume injection of H22 cells, by day 7, there was a 100% occurrence of multinodular tumors in the livers, determined by histology. At the time of death, there were 100%, 100%, 37.5% and 37.5% occurrences of tumors in the lungs, kidneys, spleen and heart, respectively. The neoplastic cells in the liver nodules showed pleomorphism, and exhibited high expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), c-myc, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2). In mice treated with a small or medium volume injection, no tumor cells were identified in the livers, spleen, kidneys or heart at any of the examined time points. By day 7 and at the time of death, there was a 100% occurrence of tumor in the lungs. A multinodular liver cancer model in mice was achieved using a large volume injection of H22 cells. © The Author(s) 2014.},

	abstract = {Background: Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L.]) is a legume cultivated throughout most tropical countries and is valued as food and feed for human and livestock respectively. The search for an improved cowpea variety has been on-going with the aim of improving traits such as grain yield, drought and pest resistance. But no information exist on the feeding value of these improved varieties. Phosphate (P) fertilizer application is recommended to augment grain yield in grain legumes but data on the effect of P fertilizer on haulm quality is limited. Results: Two separate experiments were conducted to determine the effect of P fertilizer dose on the nutritive value of haulms from different cowpea varieties (V). In experiment 1, effect of three P doses (30, 60 and 90 kg P2O5/ ha) on in vitro gas production (IVGP) characteristics, concentrations of digestible organic matter (DOM), crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of haulms from five cowpea varieties (Zaayura-SARC 4-75, Songotra-IT97K-499-35, Hewale-IT93K-192-4, IT99K 573-1-1 and Asomdwe-IT94K-410-2) were investigated using the 3 (P) x 5 (V) factorial treatment arrangements in a completely randomized design. In experiment 2, the effects of two P doses (30 and 90 kg P2O5/ha) and two varieties (Zaayura-SARC 4-75 and Hewale-IT93K-192-4) on the voluntary feed intake, live weight, haematology and carcass characteristics of Djallonke lambs were also assessed using a 2(P) x 2(V) factorial treatment arrangement. The V x P interaction significantly affected CP, NDF and ADF with CP concentration increasing with increase in P doses in Zaayura-SARC 4-75 and Asomdwe-IT94K-410-2. Whilst an increase (P < 0.05) in NDF was observed in Songotra-IT97K-499-35and Asomdwe-IT94K-410-2 as P doses increased, the other V only increased from P dose 30 to 60 kg/ha and declined at P dose 90 kg/ha. The ADF decreased (P < 0.05) with increase in P dose for all V with the exception of Songotra-IT97K-499-35. There was a significant V effect on DOM with the highest reported in Zaayura-SARC 4-75 (43.44 %). Daily DM intake, carcass length and blood urea nitrogen of the lambs were significantly affected by the V x P interaction. There was a significant V effect on globulin and P effect on live weight at slaughter, dressed weight, chuck, leg, loin, rib and flank and liver and lungs. Conclusion: It can be concluded that nutrient concentrations of cowpea haulms were positively influenced by different P dose and varieties with favorable effects on growth, haematology and carcass composition of lambs. Varieties Zaayura-SARC 4-75 and Hewale-IT93K-192-4 at P dose at 90 kg/ha are recommended to enhance growth performance and carcass yield of Djallonke lambs. © 2016 Ansah et al.},

In this study, a genomewide scan using approximately 50,000 SNP was performed in an attempt to identify genomic regions associated with fat deposition in sheep, the importance of this not only being limited to livestock facing future climate changes but also for elucidating the physiology of lipid metabolism. The genotyping results obtained with the Ovine SNP50K BeadChip in 2 fat tail breeds were compared with those obtained in 13 thin tail breeds. Direct sequencing of the annotated genes located in proximity to the markers with opposite allele frequency in thin tail vs. fat tail sheep gave additional SNP of interest. To further confirm the results of the genomewide scan, we genotyped the SNP within these genes in the 2 groups of sheep. A missense mutation in the BMP2 gene, with different allele frequency in the 2 groups, was detected. The results indicated BMP2 and VNRT as the most probable genes involved in the fat tail phenotype. © 2015 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Body mass index (BMI) is a non-invasive measurement of obesity. It is commonly used for assessing adiposity and obesity-related risk prediction. Genetic differences between ethnic groups are important factors, which contribute to the variation in phenotypic effects. India inhabited by the first out-of-Africa human population and the contemporary Indian populations are admixture of two ancestral populations; ancestral north Indians (ANI) and ancestral south Indians (ASI). Although ANI are related to Europeans, ASI are not related to any group outside Indian-subcontinent. Hence, we expect novel genetic loci associated with BMI. In association analysis, we found eight genic SNPs in extreme of distribution (P≤3.75 × 10 -5), of which WWOX has already been reported to be associated with obesity-related traits hence excluded from further study. Interestingly, we observed rs1526538, an intronic SNP of THSD7A; a novel gene significantly associated with obesity (P=2.88 × 10 -5, 8.922 × 10 -6 and 2.504 × 10 -9 in discovery, replication and combined stages, respectively). THSD7A is neural N-glycoprotein, which promotes angiogenesis and it is well known that angiogenesis modulates obesity, adipose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, hence our result find a correlation. This information can be used for drug target, early diagnosis of obesity and treatment. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

It is understood that any genetic contributions of CWR species that increase the resilience of agriculture to the stresses of climate change that help prevent or mitigate famine have value in addition to the estimated using the expanded valuation framework. One benefit to maintaining CWR in the wild is that CWRs conserved in situ continue to evolve and can generate novel and potentially more adaptive traits as the climate changes. Ex situ conservation of CWR in gene banks provides additional security and increases the availability of these genetic resources for use in breeding. Conservation of CWR germplasm may be the best strategy to ensure wild plant genetic resources are available for use in adapting agriculture. © 2015 Wiley-Blackwell. All rights reserved.},

In recent years, identification of the microbial assemblages responsible for soil N2O production has substantially advanced with the development of molecular technologies and the discoveries of novel functional guilds and new types of metabolism. However, few practical tools are available to effectively reduce in situ soil N2O flux. Combating the negative impacts of increasing N2O fluxes poses considerable challenges and will be ineffective without successfully incorporating microbially regulated N2O processes into ecosystem modeling and mitigation strategies. Here, we synthesize the latest knowledge of (i) the key microbial pathways regulating N2O production and consumption processes in terrestrial ecosystems and the critical environmental factors influencing their occurrence, and (ii) the relative contributions of major biological pathways to soil N2O emissions by analyzing available natural isotopic signatures of N2O and by using stable isotope enrichment and inhibition techniques. We argue that it is urgently necessary to incorporate microbial traits into biogeochemical ecosystem modeling in order to increase the estimation reliability of N2O emissions. We further propose a molecular methodology oriented framework from gene to ecosystem scales for more robust prediction and mitigation of future N2O emissions. © FEMS 2015. All rights reserved.},

The study was conducted over a period of three consecutive years: 2009-2011. The fluctuating asymmetry of 6 meristic traits was used as a method for evaluating of the developmental stability. In August each year, two indexes were analyzed for 50 individuals from a water basin: FAMI Frequency of Asymmetric Manifestation of an Individual and FAMF Frequency of Asymmetric Manifestation of a Feature. Throughout the period of the study, statistically significant higher levels of FA were found within the population of C. gibelio that lives in the Sazliyka River. Living conditions in the two basins are highly worsening (5th grade), and the population of C. gibelio in the Sazliyka River is in a critical condition, with a higher degree of genetic disorders of homeostasis than the population in “Rozov Kladenets” Dam Lake. © 2015, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

	abstract = {Background: Phalaris arundinacea (reed canarygrass) is a very successful invasive plant in North American wetlands, significantly impacting several ecosystem proceses. Although less common in occurrence, invasions in upland sites have also been reported. To cope with diverse or variable environments, many invasive plants have high phenotypic plasticity for morphological and physiological traits that are thought to confer higher fitness. Our objectives were to characterize plasticity of response for a number of drought stress traits and compare the responses of Phalaris genotypes collected from upland and wetland sites. To address these objectives, we conducted a greenhouse study of upland- and wetland-collected Phalaris genotypes grown in wet and dry soil conditions. The number of tillers, root:shoot ratio, specific leaf area, and concentrations of several amino acids responded in the expected, adaptive direction to growth in the dry soil treatment. Characterizing the adaptive plastic responses to abiotic stresses in invasive plants can help us understand ways in which they respond to novel environments and provides a starting point for detailed mechanistic studies of how the plastic responses of specific traits may improve fitness of invasive plants across many environments. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

	abstract = {Genetic transformation involves transfer of a DNA sequence into a plant cell and its subsequent integration into the host genome. Transformation serves as an important tool in plant biology for studying gene function and expression. It also allows for the addition of a single or few desirable traits in the existing elite varieties of plants without altering their genetic constitution. The essential prerequisites for a gene transfer system include the availability of a target tissue, a method to introduce foreign DNA, and a procedure to select transformed cells and regenerate transgenic plants (Birch, 1997). Although several methods have been used for delivery of transgenes into plant cells, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has been the preferred method for a number of species. In nature, Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a pathogenic bacterium of many dicotyledonous and a few monocotyledenous plants. During the process of infection, Agrobacterium transfers a part of its DNA (T-DNA) present on a tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid to the nuclear genome of the host plant. The components needed for transfer of T-DNA, known as the vir (virulence) genes, are present on the Ti plasmid in Agrobacterium. Transfer of the T-DNA region is achieved by the activation and action of the vir genes. Proliferating plant cells at the site of infection result in formation of tumors or crown galls. Infected cells produce amino acids known as opines that are utilized by the bacterium. The genes for opine synthesis are present in the T-DNA region, which is transferred to the host genome (Gelvin, 2003). The T-DNA transfer mechanism is utilized for the genetic transformation of crop plants, with the T-DNA region responsible for tumor formation being replaced by a T-DNA containing the desired genes of interest to be studied. Such Agrobacterium strains can no longer cause tumors upon infection and are termed disarmed strains. Genes of interest can either be inserted into the T-DNA region of a Ti plasmid or the T-DNA region of a smaller plasmid that is then introduced into disarmed Agrobacterium. The latter, known as a binary vector system, is more commonly adopted for transformation (Hellens et al., 2000). © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Objective: To observe the effects of astragalus polysaccharide (AP) on the intestinal mucosal morphology, level of secretory IgA (s-IgA) in intestinal mucus, and distribution of T lymphocyte subsets in Peyer's patch in rats with severe scald injury. Methods: One hundred and thirty SD rats were divided into sham injury group (SI, sham injured, n = 10), scald group (S, n = 30), low dosage group (LD, n = 30), moderate dosage group (MD, n = 30), and high dosage group (HD, n = 30) according to the random number table. Rats in the latter 4 groups were inflicted with 30% TBSA full-thickness scald on the back. From post injury hour 2, rats in groups LD, MD, and HD were intraperitoneally injected with 0.5 mL AP solution with the dosage of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg each day respectively, and rats in group S were injected with 0.5 mL normal saline instead. Ten rats from group SI immediately after injury and 10 rats from each of the latter4 groups on post injury day (PID) 3, 7, 14 were sacrificed, and their intestines were harvested. The morphology of ileal mucosa was examined after HE staining; the level of s-IgA in ileal mucus was determined with double-antibody sandwich ELISA method; the proportions of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes in Peyer's patches of intestine were determined with flow cytometer, and the proportion of CD4+ to CD8+ was calculated. Data were processed with one-way analysis of variance, analysis of variance of factorial design, and SNK test. Results: (1) Villi in normal form and intact villus epithelial cells were observed in rats of group SI immediately after injury, while edema of villi and necrosis and desquamation of an enormous amount of villi were observed in groups with scalded rats on PID 3, with significant infiltration of inflammatory cells. On PID 7, no obvious improvement in intestinal mucosal lesion was observed in groups with scalded rats. On PID 14, the pathology in intestinal mucosa of rats remained nearly the same in group S, and it was alleviated obviously in groups LD and MD, and the morphology of intestinal mucosa of rats in group HD was recovered to that of group SI. (2) On PID 3, 7, and 14, the level of s-IgA in intestinal mucus significantly decreased in groups S, LD, MD, and HI) [(43 ±5), (45 ±5), (46 ±5) μg/mL; (47 ± 5), (48 ±5), (49 ±6) μg/mL; (50 ±6), (51 ±5), (52 ±5) μg/mL; (53 ±6), (54 ±5), (55 ± 5) μg/mL] as compared with that of rats in group SI immediately after injury [(69 ±4) μg/mL, with P values below 0.05]. The level of s-IgA in intestinal mucus of rats in group MD was significantly higher than that in group S at each time point (with P values below 0.05), and that of group HD was significantly higher than that in groups S and LD at each time point (with P values below 0.05). (3) Compared with those of rats in group SI immediately after injury, the proportions of CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes significantly decreased in groups with scalded rats at each time point (with P values below 0.05), except for those in group HD on PID 14. The proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes of rats in group LD was significantly higher than that in group S on PID 3 (P < 0.05). The proportions of CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes were significantly higher in groups MD and HD than in groups S and LD (except for the proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes in group MD on PID 3 and 14) at each time point (with P values below 0.05). The proportion of CD3+ T lymphocytes on PID 7 and 14 and that of CD4+ T lymphocytes on PID 3 were significantly higher in group HD than in group MD (with P values below 0.05). Compared with that of rats in group SI immediately after injury, the proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes significantly increased in the other 4 groups at each time point (with P values below 0.05). The proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes was significantly lower in rats of group LD on PID 7 and 14 and groups MD and HD at each time point than in group S (with P values below 0.05). The proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes was significantly lower in rats of group MD on PID 7 and 14 and group HD at each time point than in group LD (with P values below 0.05). The proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes was significantly lower in rats of group HD on PID 7 and 14 than in group MD (with P values below 0.05). On PID 3, 7, and 14, the proportion of CD4+ to CD8+ was significantly lower in groups S, LD, MD, and HD (0.65 ±0.11, 0.68 ±0.13, 0.73 ±0.22; 0.76 ±0.15, 0.78 ± 0.14, 0.90+0.10; 0.85 ±0.21, 0.89 ±0.18, 1.08 ±0.19; 0.99 ±0.20, 1.05 ±0.21, 1.25 ±0.23) as compared with that of rats in group SI immediately after injury (1.74 ± 0.20, with P values below 0.05). The proportion of CD4+ to CD8+ was significantly higher in rats of group HD than in group MD on PID 7 (P < 0.05), and the proportion was significantly higher in these two groups than in group S at each time point (with P values below 0.05). The proportion of CD4+ to CD8+ was significantly higher in rats of group MD on PID 14 and group HD at each time point than in group LD (with P values below 0.05). Compared within each group, the proportions of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes and the proportion of CD4+ to CD8+ of rats in groups LD, MD, and HD showed a trend of gradual elevation along with passage of time. Conclusions: AP can improve the injury to intestinal mucosa and modulate the balance of T lymphocyte subsets in Peyer's patch in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and it can promote s-IgA secretion of intestinal mucosa in a dose-dependent manner.},

This animal is endangered as a result of deforestation, predation by introduced carnivores and mortality caused by vehicles. We performed theriogenological examinations of 32 male and 25 female Ryukyu long-furred rats carcasses collected from wild populations on northern Okinawa-jima Island from December 2005 to September 2013. Adult males had remarkably large preputial glands. Seminiferous diameter of adult was significantly small (136 ± 28 µm, n=8) from April to August. Numerous spermatozoa were observed from September through February, and seminiferous diameter was significantly large (216 ± 27 µm, n=12) during this time in adults; testes length changed in a similar pattern. These findings indicate that the mating season may occur from September through February. Size (body length) at sexual maturity was estimated to be >560 mm in both sexes. From observation of corpora lutea and placental scars, litter size was estimated to range from 2 to 12 (average=6, n=4). These results provide fundamental knowledge that will be beneficial for in situ and ex situ conservation of this rare species. © 2015 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.},

	abstract = {The description of a suitable breeding strategy in drought prone environments is an important function for sunflower breeders. To achieve this function, dependable information on heritability and gene effects on yield and related traits under these conditions is necessary. Thirty sunflower hybrids were produced by line × tester cross of six male-sterile and five restorer lines. hybrids were evaluated in three levels of irrigation as follows: non-stressed plots irrigated at regular intervals (W1), mild water stress (W2), from the beginning of button stage (R4) to seed filling initiation (R6), and severe water stress (W3) started from the beginning of button stage (R4) to physiological maturity. Based on observations, plant height, stem diameter, number of seed were controlled by additive effects under irrigation conditions. Head diameter, plant height, stem diameter, 1000-seed weight, number of seed and yield were controlled by additive effects under mild stressed conditions. Under severe stress conditions, however, head diameter, plant height, stem diameter, number of seeds were controlled by additive effects, plant height and stem diameter were controlled by both additive and dominant effects and Seed yield was mainly influenced by dominant effects. Yield correlated positively with head diameter and plant height, 1000-seed weight and number of seeds. According to heritability and correlation between traits, under drought stressed conditions in breeding programs, number of seed, head diameter and plant height can be reliable criteria for selection of tolerant genotypes with higher yields. © 2016, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

	abstract = {Physiological traits of Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl. in response to different levels of polluted air conditions were analysed in Nezahat Gökyiğit Botanical Garden which is located at the intersection of TEM and E5 highways in İstanbul. To determine the level of air pollution at the investigated area, for a 1 year period, monthly passive air pollution (SO2, NO2, O3, VOCs) sampling were conducted at four sampling sites which were chosen as representatives of the whole profile of the botanical garden. Along with air pollution monitoring, some physiological parameters of the leaves of F. angustifolia, − total chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, chl a/chl b ratio, net photosynthesis rate, specific leaf dry weight, water content percentage, leaf area and heavy metal concentrations- were analyzed during the growing period. Also PAH, heavy metal and PCB concentrations of the soil were detected in the nearby area to see the extend of the pollution on the region. While no SO2 pollution was observed, NO2 appeared to exceed the concentration limits that are stated as harmful for vegetation. O3 concentrations dominated in the area during summer. VOC, PAH and PCB concentrations on the soil were found to be related to the traffic pollution. Excessive levels of Fe, Pb and Cd of the unwashed leaves were determined. Among all the pollutants, only NO2, O3, Fe and Cd found to be responsible of plant injury in the area. However the general physiological status of F. angustifolia is not seem to be effected from the urban environment conditions of the botanical garden which can be related to its tolerance mechanisms. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.},

	abstract = {Hysterothylacium aduncum (Nematoda, Anisakidae) was isolated from the intestine of the common sole Solea solea (Family, Soleidae) collected from coasts along Alexandria City at the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt, during the period from May to September 2013. Light and scanning electron microscopy revealed that this nematode parasite belongs to the family Anisakidae in the genus Hysterothylacium. The type species is named H. aduncum, based on the presence of three interlocked lips with the interlabium in between, the presence of cephalic papillae, and large numbers of caudal papillae in males. Body measurements showed that the male worms were smaller than females measuring 13.9–18 mm (16.2 ± 0.2) in length and 0.26–0.34 mm (0.30 ± 0.01) in width. Females measured 20.5–24.5 mm (22.7 ± 0.2) in length and 0.41–0.52 mm (0.45 ± 0.01) in width. The morphological characteristics of this species was confirmed by molecular analysis of 18S rDNA for these parasites followed by comparison between sequence data for them with those obtained from the Genbank showing that H. aduncum is deeply embedded in the genus Hysterothylacium with a sequence similarity between 95.5–94.3 % with close relationships to other H. aduncum specimens and Hysterothylacium sp. Furthermore, it was shown that this parasitic nematode is able to accumulate larger concentrations of heavy metals such as Fe, Cu, Cd, and Ni within its tissues than of its host fish and thus it can be used as a useful bio-indicator of water pollution. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Male lambs had higher cooking loss (P≤0.05), higher proportions of linoleic and α-linolenic fatty acids (P≤0.05), and n-6 PUFA (P≤0.05) and n-6/n-3 ratio (P≤0.01) than female lambs. An increase in slaughter weight significantly affected carcass weight (P≤0.01), dressing percentage (P≤0.01) and the parameter a* (P≤0.05) of the meat colour. The season significantly affected slaughter weight (P≤0.01), carcass weight (P≤0.01), meat colour parameters (P≤0.05) and fatty acid composition (P≤0.05). Lambs slaughtered at a similar age and reared under similar conditions will have very similar expressions of meat quality traits, regardless of gender. Apart from yield and the redness of the meat, it is expected that slaughter weight will not notably affect any other trait that could be of interest for buyers. The season affected almost all the investigated traits, which was primarily due to the different availability of forage. © 2016, University of Zagreb, Facultty of Veterinary Medicine.

	abstract = {Microbiome analysis has identified a state of microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) in patients with chronic intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer. The bacterial phylum Proteobacteria is often overrepresented in these individuals, with Escherichia coli being the most prevalent species. It is clear that a complex interplay between the host, bacteria and bacterial genes is implicated in the development of these intestinal diseases. Understanding the basic elements of these interactions could have important implications for disease detection and management. Recent studies have revealed that E. coli utilizes a complex arsenal of virulence factors to colonize and persist in the intestine. Some of these virulence factors, such as the genotoxin colibactin, were found to promote colorectal cancer in experimental models. In this Review, we summarize key features of the dysbiotic states associated with chronic intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer, and discuss how the dysregulated interplay between host and bacteria could favor the emergence of E. coli with pathological traits implicated in these pathologies. © 2014, Company of Biologists Ltd.

	abstract = {The impact of climate change on parasites and parasitic diseases is a growing concern and numerous empirical and mechanistic models have been developed to predict climate-driven spatial and temporal changes in the distribution of parasites and disease risk. Variation in parasite phenotype and life-history traits between isolates could undermine the application of such models at broad spatial scales. Seasonal variation in the transmission of the haematophagous gastrointestinal nematode Haemonchus contortus, one of the most pathogenic helminth species infecting sheep and goats worldwide, is primarily determined by the impact of environmental conditions on the free-living stages. To evaluate variability in the development success and mortality of the free-living stages of H. contortus and the impact of this variability on future climate impact modelling, three isolates of diverse origin were cultured at a range of temperatures between 15 °C and 37 °C to determine their development success compared with simulations using the GLOWORM-FL H. contortus model. No significant difference was observed in the developmental success of the three isolates of H. contortus tested, nor between isolates and model simulations. However, development success of all isolates at 37 °C was lower than predicted by the model, suggesting the potential for overestimation of transmission risk at higher temperatures, such as those predicted under some scenarios of climate change. Recommendations are made for future climate impact modelling of gastrointestinal nematodes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

Material and Method: The chemical structures of newly synthesized compounds were elucidated by IR,1H NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis data. Their antimicrobial activities against Staphylococus aureus NCCS 2079, Bacillus Cereus, NCCS 2106, Escherichia coli NCCS 2065, Pseudomanas aeruginos NCCS 2200, Aspergillus niger NCCS 1196 and Candida albicans NCCS 2106 were investigated by employing disk diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration was found out by broth dilution method. Results: Elemental analysis of the compounds indicated that the values found by the experiments were very close to theoretically calculated values. IR and1H NMR spectral assignments of critical functional groups were indicated in each case. Mass spectral fragmentation confirmed the formation of the final product to be screened for antimicrobial activity. Antibacterial and antifungal activity of each of the compounds were evaluated and presented. Each member of the series of compounds was found to be active against tested microbes in particular, the derivative ‘8C’ was found to exhibit better antimicrobial activity.

	abstract = {Background: Organic pig production is expanding and amongst the objectives of organic farming are enhancing animal health and welfare. However, some studies have reported a higher prevalence of lameness and joint condemnation at slaughter in free-range/organic pigs than in conventionally raised pigs. Organic slaughter pigs have free-range housing in which indoor and outdoor access is compulsory, while in conventional farming the pigs are commonly confined to indoor pens. The present study evaluated the effects of free-range and confined housing on lameness prevalence in a herd of 106 finisher pigs, and whether osteochondrosis and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae associated arthritis influences these effects. We also evaluated the association between clinical lameness during the rearing period and joint condemnations at slaughter. Results: Seventy free-range and 36 confined housed fattener pigs were scored for their gait twice during the rearing period and 848 joints were evaluated post mortem. Osteochondrosis was more frequent among free-range than confined pigs (P < 0.05), and when present it was also more severe (P < 0.001). Pigs with more numerous and more severe osteochondral lesions had their gait affected more than did pigs with fewer such lesions (P < 0.05). Hence it was a paradox that we did not detect more lameness among the free-range pigs than the confined pigs. E. rhusiopathiae associated arthritis was not diagnosed. The association between gait remarks/clinical lameness and joint condemnations at slaughter was not significant. Conclusions: The results indicate that free-range housing may have both positive and negative effects on locomotory traits. Free-range pigs may be less clinically affected by osteochondrosis than are confined pigs. One explanation for this effect may be strengthening of joint supportive tissue and pain relief promoted by exercise. Visual gait scoring missed serious joint lesions that probably were harmful to the pigs, and should therefore not be used as a sole indicator of joint/leg health in welfare inspection of pigs. The association between gait scores and joint condemnation appeared to be poor. This study was limited to one herd, and so more and larger studies on the effects of free-range housing on lameness severity and osteochondrosis development in pigs are recommended. © 2015 Etterlin et al.},

	abstract = {Progress in crop improvement is limited by the ability to identify favourable combinations of genotypes (G) and management practices (M) in relevant target environments (E) given the resources available to search among the myriad of possible combinations. To underpin yield advance we require prediction of phenotype based on genotype. In plant breeding, traditional phenotypic selection methods have involved measuring phenotypic performance of large segregating populations in multi-environment trials and applying rigorous statistical procedures based on quantitative genetic theory to identify superior individuals. Recent developments in the ability to inexpensively and densely map/sequence genomes have facilitated a shift from the level of the individual (genotype) to the level of the genomic region. Molecular breeding strategies using genome wide prediction and genomic selection approaches have developed rapidly. However, their applicability to complex traits remains constrained by gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, which restrict the predictive power of associations of genomic regions with phenotypic responses. Here it is argued that crop ecophysiology and functional whole plant modelling can provide an effective link between molecular and organism scales and enhance molecular breeding by adding value to genetic prediction approaches. A physiological framework that facilitates dissection and modelling of complex traits can inform phenotyping methods for marker/gene detection and underpin prediction of likely phenotypic consequences of trait and genetic variation in target environments. This approach holds considerable promise for more effectively linking genotype to phenotype for complex adaptive traits. Specific examples focused on drought adaptation are presented to highlight the concepts. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {Objective: It was the aim of this study to determine the diagnostic accuracy of high-risk prognostic factors and morphological characteristics of retinoblastomas using digital whole slide images (WSI) generated by a scanner. Methods: Forty-seven H&E sections of glass slides with high-risk morphological features of retinoblastoma were analyzed. Slides were scanned as WSI and reviewed. The results were compared with those obtained after reviewing the slides using a regular microscope as the gold standard. McNemar's test (MT), the percentage of agreement (POA), and sensitivity (S) and specificity (Sp) were evaluated between WSI and conventional microscopy. Results: There were no differences with respect to multicentricity, growth type, rosette formation, choroidal invasion, anterior chamber invasion, extraocular extension, scleral extension, optic nerve invasion, necrosis, or Azzopardi effect between WSI analysis and light microscopy (MT, p = 1.0; POA = 100%; S = 100%, and Sp = 100%). Discordance was found in 1 case where calcification could not be found using WSI (MT, p = 1.00; POA = 97.9%; S = 100%, and Sp = 97.8%). Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report using digital pathology (WSI) to evaluate prognostic factors in eyes containing retinoblastomas. Using WSI, the pathologist was able to detect high-risk morphological features in retinoblastoma. To date, WSI is an important tool, in particular for ophthalmic pathologists examining enucleation and exenteration specimens.  © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {When predicting the response of organisms to global change, models use measures of climate at a coarse resolution from general circulation models or from downscaled regional models. Organisms, however, do not experience climate at such large scales. The climate heterogeneity over a landscape and how much of that landscape an organism can sample will determine ultimately the microclimates experienced by organisms. This past few decades has seen an important increase in the number of studies reporting microclimatic patterns at small scales. This synthesis intends to unify studies reporting microclimatic heterogeneity (mostly temperature) at various spatial scales, to infer any emerging trends, and to discuss the causes and consequences of such heterogeneity for organismal performance and with respect to changing land use patterns and climate. First, we identify the environmental drivers of heterogeneity across the various spatial scales that are pertinent to ectotherms. The thermal heterogeneity at the local and micro-scales is mostly generated by the architecture or the geometrical features of the microhabitat. Then, the thermal heterogeneity experienced by individuals is modulated by behavior. Second, we survey the literature to quantify thermal heterogeneity from the micro-scale up to the scale of a landscape in natural habitats. Despite difficulties in compiling studies that differ much in their design and aims, we found that there is as much thermal heterogeneity across micro-, local and landscape scales, and that the temperature range is large in general (>9 °C on average, and up to 26 °C). Third, we examine the extent to which urban habitats can be used to infer the microclimatic patterns of the future. Urban areas generate globally drier and warmer microclimatic patterns and recent evidence suggest that thermal traits of ectotherms are adapted to them. Fourth, we explore the interplay between microclimate heterogeneity and the behavioral thermoregulatory abilities of ectotherms in setting their overall performance. We used a random walk framework to show that the thermal heterogeneity allows a more precise behavioral thermoregulation and a narrower temperature distribution of the ectotherm compared to less heterogeneous microhabitats. Finally, we discuss the potential impacts of global change on the fine scale mosaics of microclimates. The amplitude of change may differ between spatial scales. In heterogeneous microhabitats, the amplitude of change at micro-scale, caused by atmospheric warming, can be substantial while it can be limited at the local and landscape scales. We suggest that the warming signal will influence species performance and biotic interactions by modulating the mosaic of microclimates. © The Author 2016.

	abstract = {Desert riparian ecosystems of North America are hotspots of biodiversity that support many sensitive species, and are in a region experiencing some of the highest rates of climatic alteration in North America. Fremont cottonwood, Populus fremontii, is a foundation tree species of this critical habitat, but it is threatened by global warming and regional drying, and by a non-native tree/shrub, Tamarix spp., all of which can disrupt the mutualism between P. fremontii and its beneficial mycorrhizal fungal communities. Specialist herbivorous leaf beetles (Diorhabda spp.) introduced for biocontrol of Tamarix are altering the relationship between this shrub and its environment. Repeated episodic feeding on Tamarix foliage by Diorhabda results in varying rates of dieback and mortality, depending on genetic variation in allocation of resources, growing conditions, and phenological synchrony between herbivore and host plant. In this article, we review the complex interaction between climatic change and species introductions and their combined impacts on P. fremontii and their associated communities. We anticipate that (1) certain genotypes of P. fremontii will respond more favorably to the presence of Tamarix and to climatic change due to varying selection pressures to cope with competition and stress; (2) the ongoing evolution of Diorhabda's life cycle timing will continue to facilitate its expansion in North America, and will over time enhance herbivore impact to Tamarix; (3) defoliation by Diorhabda will reduce the negative impact of Tamarix on P. fremontii associations with mycorrhizal fungi; and (4) spatial variability in climate and climatic change will modify the capacity for Tamarix to survive episodic defoliation by Diorhabda, thereby altering the relationship between Tamarix and P. fremontii, and its associated mycorrhizal fungal communities. Given the complex biotic/abiotic interactions outlined in this review, conservation biologists and riparian ecosystem managers should strive to identify and conserve the phenotypic traits that underpin tolerance and resistance to stressors such as climate change and species invasion. Such efforts will greatly enhance conservation restoration efficacy for protecting P. fremontii forests and their associated communities. © The Author 2015.

These stresses negatively influence the survival of crop plants, leading to losses of up to 70 % in biomass production and yields of staple food crops (Kaur et al., 2008; Thakur et al., 2010) and decreases of as much as 50 % in overall productivity (Rodríguez et al., 2005; Acquaah, 2007). For these reasons, abiotic stresses threaten food security worldwide. The degree of severity of stress and the plasticity of the plants determine the types of morphological, anatomical, and physiological changes that adversely affect plant growth, metabolic profile, nutritional potential, developmental processes, and productivity (Altman, 2003). At the molecular level, abiotic stresses lead to an enhanced production of reactive oxygen species, which cause peroxidation of lipids, oxidation of proteins, damage to nucleic acids, enzyme inhibition, and-at extreme conditions-programmed cell death and even the death of the entire plant (Mittler, 2002; Sharma and Dubey, 2005; Sharma and Dubey, 2007). © 2015 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},

	abstract = {This review uses production and climate data to examine global and local production trends that can be related to events such as drought. UK grain quality data is also available and provides an overview of trends in protein content. Literature surveys show a consistent reduction in grain size due to the effects of temperature and/or drought. A review of gene expression studies showed that most genes involved in starch synthesis are down regulated under heat stress. Net protein production is also reduced under heat and/or drought stress but apparently to a lesser degree as the reduction in grain mass is larger, resulting in an increase in protein concentration. Modelling has suggested that adaptation could be achieved by moving production to more extreme latitudes but other research suggests that simply transferring germplasm from one region to another is unlikely to be successful. Another review has identified drought tolerance phenotypes that could be used to breed more drought tolerant crops. At the time of the review, the authors concluded that phenotypic selection was generally preferable to forms of marker-assisted breeding and have used the approach to produce drought tolerant wheat cultivars. Transgenic approaches have also been shown to improve drought tolerance under controlled environment conditions but there are no results to show how well these results translate into improved crop performance under field conditions. The recent advances in genomic data and detecting marker-trait associations suggest that marker-assisted breeding will play a much more important role in breeding drought tolerant cereals in the future.

	abstract = {Crop modeling in support of breeders' decisions on selection criteria can benefit from the new global focus on phenomics because it provides new information on existing genetic diversity for useful traits. This study attempted an in silico prediction of margins for genetic improvements of early vigor (biomass produced during vegetative growth) and drought resistance combined, based on virtual recombination of several traits (here syn. model parameters) within ranges of trait variation observed in a panel of diverse rice genotypes. The Ecomeristem model was parameterized by multi-parameter optimization procedures applied to observed datasets for 136 rice genotypes. The traits within the observed ranges were then recombined in silico to generate a virtual population of 9000 individuals. Simulations of real and virtual phenotypes under three water treatments, using finite water resources during stress cycles, indicated strong and similar trade-offs between constitutive vigor and drought resistance in both real and virtual, recombinant populations. A substantial margin for potential genetic improvement of vigor with unchanged drought resistance was predicted, drawing chiefly from structural growth and development traits that would increase internal demand for assimilates (larger and thicker leaves, increased leaf appearance rates). Increased vigor would not necessarily require greater photosynthetic potential per se. However, improved drought resistance with unchanged constitutive vigor would require greater water economy (increased photosynthetic potential and limited water use, therefore higher transpiration efficiency) and greater tolerance of leaf extension and gas exchange rates to drought, while tillering ability should be limited in favor of larger and thicker leaves. These results carry significant uncertainty because they predict virtual genotypes and their phenotypes, based on simple assumptions in the model (namely on gas exchange) and in genetics (free, additive trait combinability). But the approach is innovative and may eventually help developing ideotypes drawing from information of existing diversity and integrative modeling of phenotypes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

	abstract = {Oats are undervalued in comparison with wheat, rice and barley, despite their unique composition that includes many of the nutrients required for health and a reduced risk of degenerative disease incidence. Furthermore, oats as whole grain and some of their associated products also contain β-glucan, a complex polysaccharide that has an approved health claim to reduce blood cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of CHD incidence if consumed at ≥ 3 g/d. At the agronomic level, oats exhibit optimal growth in regions of moderate temperature and long day length. In addition, they can tolerate wet weather and acidic soils more effectively than other cereals, such as wheat. Studies have shown that there is diversity in the content and composition of nutrients and health-beneficial components within the available wild and cultivated germplasm and that these are amenable to be enhanced by different agronomic practices as well as are susceptible to climatic variation. The advances in modern plant genetics, developed in sister cereals such as wheat, rice and barley, mean that oat development and exploitation should see an acceleration in the coming decade as they are adopted and applied. These advances include approaches such as genome sequencing, genotyping by sequencing and the allied next-level analytical approaches of RNA sequencing, transcriptome profiling and metabolomics. The collation and coordination of these approaches should lead to the generation of new, tailored oat varieties that are nutritionally enhanced and contain a greater proportion of health-beneficial components that can be translated through into a wide(r) range of consumer products with the ultimate hope of associated benefits to human health and nutrition.

	abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of highly lethal malignant tumor. PDAC is locally invasive and is surrounded by a dense desmoplasia or fibrosis, which can involve adjacent vital structures. Previously, the effect of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) of stroma in the progression of PDAC has received more attention, and most in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that PSCs appear to confer biological aggressiveness. However, clinical trials targeting desmoplasia or PSCs showed disappointing results. Recent studies found that stromal components, especially activated PSCs, are able to inhibit the occurrence and progression of PDAC. Inhibition of the stroma or desmoplasia through genetic regulations or drugs accelerates the formation and progression of PDAC. Thus, we hypothesized that in various times and spaces, there is a balance between the tumor epithelia and stroma; once the balance is upset, the tumor traits may undergo certain changes. Therefore, finding the key changing points of this relationship to corrupt or influence it, instead of blindly inhibiting the stroma motivation or simply maintaining stroma activation, will destroy the cooperation or promote the competition and antagonism among cells. This approach may render tumors more vulnerable and thus unable to resist anti-cancer therapies. © Med Sci Monit, 2014.},

The records on first lactation production and reproduction performance of 961 Sahiwal cattle spread over a period of 47 years (1961-2007) were used for the study. The first lactation traits considered were age at first calving (AFC), first lactation 305-day or less milk yield (FL305DMY), first lactation length (FLL), first service period (FSP) and first dry period (FDP). The non-genetic factors incorporated in the model for AFC, FL305DMY, FLL, FSP and FDP accounted for 19.25, 21.25, 35.45, 07.09 and 21.12 per cent of total variation, respectively. Among the non-genetic factors, the period had highly significant effect on all the traits; while the age group had no effect on FL305DMY, FLL, FSP and FDP and the season had highly significant effect only on FDP. The days open had highly significant effect on FL305DMY, FLL and FDP. The overall least squares means for AFC, FL305DMY, FLL, FSP and FDP were 1117.02 days, 1759.86 kg, 303.46 days, 149.63 days and 163.75 days, respectively in Sahiwal cattle. It was concluded that the first lactation traits were highly influenced by the period of birth/ calving. It also reflected that the milch stock was maintained under comparatively favorable farm conditions and the fluctuations in extreme climatic conditions did not affect these traits in Sahiwal cattle. © 2015, Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

	abstract = {A cohort of 100 eggs of Panstrongylus geniculatus (Latreille) was reared in the laboratory under constant conditions (temperature 26±1°C, 60±10% RH), with mortality and fecundity data recorded weekly. We calculated stage-specific development times, age-specific mortality and fecundity (18.4 eggs/♀/wk), and stage-specific and total preadult mortality (31.6%), and the weekly intrinsic rate of natural increase (ro = 0.096), the finite population growth rate (< = 1.109), the net reproductive rate (R0 = 60.45), and the generation time (T = 46.34 wk). Elasticity analysis showed that the dominant lifehistory trait determining < was survival (particularly the adult female's survival). Adult females dominated the stage-specific reproductive value, and the egg stage dominated the stable stage distribution (SSD). The damping ratio (rgr = 1.096) suggests a relatively rapid period of recovery to a disturbed SSD. Results were compared with one previous study and conform relatively well, considering that environmental conditions were not the same. We estimated the colonizing ability of P. geniculatus, using as a criterion the ro/b index, and obtained the value of 0.74, an indicator of a good colonizer, and similar to well-known invasive species such as Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma infestans. The life history traits and demographic parameters here presented for P. geniculatus are discussed in terms of their usefulness for evolutionary studies and vector control activities. © The Authors 2015.},

	abstract = {White-lipped (Tayassu pecari) and collared (Pecari tajacu) peccaries can be farmed as an alternative to subsistence hunting in Neotropical countries. The animals often show high reactivity to handling, usually involving capture with a net, which is a cause for concern because it poses risks to both animals' and keepers' welfare. We aimed to assess the temperament of both peccary species, evaluating animals' reactions during handling, providing an emotional indicator and a new animal selection criterion for peccary farms. Three indicators were used to assess the temperament of 17 white-lipped and 19 collared peccaries: qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA, by using 12 behavioural adjectives); time to drive each animal through a corridor into a chute (TD, s); and flight speed (FS, m s-1). A Principal Components Analysis was performed for the QBA data to define a temperament index (TI). White-lipped peccaries showed TI scores associated with worse temperament traits than collared peccaries. White-lipped peccaries showed higher TD and FS means than collared peccaries. We found a correlation between TD and FS, but not between TD and TI, nor between FS and TI. The lack of correlation between all temperament indicators occurred, probably, because they measure different aspects of peccaries' reactions toward humans and the farm environment during handling. A wide phenotypic variability was found among individuals within both species' populations. The results provide an opportunity to address the role of temperament assessment, improving handling procedures and exploring the possibility of including temperament as a selection criterion in captive breeding programmes. © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

	abstract = {Background Up-to-date evidence about levels and trends in disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is an essential input into global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries. Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2·4 billion and 1·6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537·6 million in 1990 to 764·8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114·87 per 1000 people to 110·31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21·1% in 1990 to 31·2% in 2013. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: The aim of the study is to determine the influence of strong and continuous drought on yield and grain quality of bread wheat in Dobrudzha region. The levels of yield and grain quality through their components and parameters generated in contrast to both drought and favorable years are directly compared. Methods: In field conditions in Competitive yield trails grain yield and some traits, directly or indirectly associated with it are analyzed, and the most important parameters characterizing the quality of grain, too. Basis for comparison data from a favorable yield and quality of grain in 2006 was used. A detailed analysis of any change of trait of productivity and quality index of 65 advanced breeding lines was made. Specific change of individual indexes of quality of grain depends directly on the genetic nature of the studied genotypes. Key results: Prolonged drought reduces most grain yield, resulting in reduction of all traits associated with it. The most conservative trait is 1000 kernel weight, which changes the least, while most reduce the number of productive tillers. In grain quality the drought changes inadequate individual trait performance. Specific weight increases, and the protein content and sedimentation value is not substantially altered. All other indexes are changed in fairly negatively to varying degrees. Conclusions: The highest grain yield under drought in Dobrudzha has breeding lines that fail to form the highest number of grains per spike. Notwithstanding the terms of the year grain yield is determined most strongly by the trait number of kernels per spike. Under drought the most negatively affected performance have the strength of the dough and the quality of the grain-dough stability, including valorimetric value and loaf volume. When changing the quality of grain as lower the genetic quality talents of a variety, so the values of its parameters are changed slightly. This explains the wide variation in quality of wheat due to strong differences in terms of year conditions. © 2015, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences. All rights reserved.},

Biodiversity broadly includes complexity across levels of biotic organization from genetics and populations to communities, landscapes, and ecoregions. Global climate change potentially would increase the loss of biodiversity and natural habitats. The ability of CRWs for dispersal is a key aspect in the assessment of climate-change impact on their distribution. The chapter highlights the functional diversity and predicts characterization of CWRs. Functional diversity of CWR traits, is vital to short-term ecosystem resource dynamics and long-term ecosystem stability, as it increases positive interactions or complimentary functions within an ecosystem. The conservation of CWRs' biodiversity may ensure the continued survival of CWRs that provide additional genetic diversity for breeding, development of new varieties, and provisioning of other ecosystem services. © 2015 Wiley-Blackwell.

	abstract = {Light inside a canopy constantly fluctuates. Under fluctuating light (FL) conditions, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate constantly change. In this study, we explored whether this dynamics of stomata movements upon FL influenced the water use efficiency of rice in the field. We used a USDA-curated rice mini-core diversity panel consisting of 204 worldwide distributed accessions. A priori model on dynamic stomatal response to FL was utilised to identify kinetic parameters describing the stomatal delays during the closing (τcl) and the opening (τop) phase. Result showed that τcl had a larger variation than τop across the mini-core panel. τcl was negatively correlated with water use efficiency (WUE) related traits, stem diameter, grain weight per tiller and heading time, but positively correlated with maximum annual temperature, carbon assimilation related traits and biomass (P<0.05). We further showed a strong correlation of τcl with the relative decrease of biomass under drought in 14 accessions with different τcl. We discussed the adjustment of stomatal conductance under fluctuating light in light of the trade-off between optimising CO2 uptake and optimising water saving. This study suggests that stomatal dynamics under fluctuating light is closely related to drought resistance and hence detailed study is needed to enable its application in breeding drought tolerance in rice.},

For this, the lines were crossed in topcross scheme with two hybrids adapted to second crop (P30K75 and AG9010), used as narrow genetic base testers. The topcrosses were evaluated in randomized block design, with two repetitions, in four key-locations for the second crop along the states of Paraná, São Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul. In addition, the lines per se were evaluated in Floresta-PR. The following traits were evaluated: (i) grain yield, in kg ha-1; (ii) male and female flowering, and (iii) tolerance to drought stress. For the inbred lines per se, the mean squares were significant (p < 0.05) for both grain yield and flowering. The general combining ability of testers and lines and the specific combining ability between testers and lines were significant (p < 0.05) for all traits. The line 21 stood out because of the high general combining ability along the four environments. Among the lines 4, 37, 38, 39 and 47, relevant general combining ability effects (gi) were verified for grain yield at least in two environments, including drought stress environment and flowering. The combinations AG9010 × Line 37 and P30K75 × Line 18 stood out, and lines 18 and 37 were indicated as testers for new lines coming from the testers.},

	abstract = {In sheep, social reactivity and reactivity to humans are relevant behavioral responses that are used to investigate the behavioral adaptation of farm animals to various rearing conditions. Such traits were previously reported as heritable and associated with several QTLs. However, few behavior-related genotype by environment (G × E) interactions have been reported to date. The experiment was performed on 2,989 male and female lambs issued from 30 sires. Every sire had progeny reared under both intensive and extensive conditions. After weaning, all lambs were individually exposed to two standardized behavioral tests. A broad range of behaviors including vocalizations, locomotion, localization, vigilance, and flight distance were assessed. Two complementary statistic approaches, with and without assumptions on the biological significance of behaviors, were performed to investigate social reactivity and reactivity to humans. G × E interactions were investigated based on the genetic correlations estimated for each factor or trait between farming conditions; those significantly different from 1 indicating a G × E. Environmental effects showed that social reactivity and reactivity to humans were higher in intensively reared lambs. The heritability of factors or traits used to measure social reactivity and reactivity to humans was similar in both rearing conditions. Estimated heritabilities were high for vocalizations in response to social isolation, moderate for locomotion and vigilance in response to social isolation, and low for both flight distance to an approaching human and proximity to a motionless human. No significant G × E interaction was found for vocalizations. G × E interactions were found for locomotion, vigilance and flight distance. Genetic correlations between both environments were low to moderate for vigilance, locomotion and flight distance. Vocalization in response to social isolation with or without human presence was identified as a robust trait and could be used to improve sheep sociability, independently of the environment. A G × E interaction was observed for behavioral reactivity to humans. Although moderate, the genetic correlation for this trait between intensive and extensive conditions could be used to select sires in the same environment by taking into account the G × E and to produce in different environments progenies that are less reactive to humans. © 2016 American Society of Animal Science.

	abstract = {This review outlines a conceptual framework that links climate-related risk components (hazard, exposure and vulnerability) to the genetics and genomics tools used for developing new crop varieties to promote adaptation to extreme weather events and to mitigate risks related to the effects of climate change. The establishment of templates for identifiable features or markers on the genome to refine genetic maps for monogenic traits-especially those related to stress resistance in plant model species-has benefited plant genome projects from early on. Genomics has facilitated the discovery of genes affecting quantitative, or continuous, traits for enhancing yield in low-input sustainable agriculture. Genomics and genomic tools developed in model species favour translational approaches when searching for orthologous genes in diploid crop species or diploid relatives of polyploid crop species. Discovering genetic variation through focused identification of germplasm from extreme environments, and generating genetic variation by mutagenesis and 'genome editing', will facilitate targeted induction of new alleles and adaptation to the effects of climate change. Genetic marker-aided transfer and shuffling alleles by introgression breeding and publically accepted plant transformation methodologies, will accelerate precise breeding and release of crop cultivars that will greatly benefit adaptation to and mitigation of risks related to climate change. © 2015 CAB International.},

	abstract = {The control of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) is mainly based on the use of drugs, grazing management, use of copper oxide wire particles and bioactive forages. Resistance to anthelmintic drugs in small ruminants is documented worldwide. Host genetic resistance to parasites, has been increasingly used as a complementary control strategy, along with the conventional intervention methods mentioned above. Genetic diversity in resistance to GIN has been well studied in experimental and commercial flocks in temperate climates and more developed economies. However, there are very few report outputs from the more extensive low-input/output smallholder systems in developing and emerging countries. Furthermore, results on quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with nematode resistance from various studies have not always been consistent, mainly due to the different nematodes studied, different host breeds, ages, climates, natural infections versus artificial challenges, infection level at sampling periods, among others. The increasing use of genetic markers (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, SNPs) in GWAS or the use of whole genome sequence data and a plethora of analytic methods offer the potential to identify loci or regions associated nematode resistance. Genomic selection as a genome-wide level method overcomes the need to identify candidate genes. Benefits in genomic selection are now being realised in dairy cattle and sheep under commercial settings in the more advanced countries. However, despite the commercial benefits of using these tools, there are practical problems associated with incorporating the use of marker-assisted selection or genomic selection in low-input/output smallholder farming systems breeding schemes. Unlike anthelmintic resistance, there is no empirical evidence suggesting that nematodes will evolve rapidly in response to resistant hosts. The strategy of nematode control has evolved to a more practical manipulation of host-parasite equilibrium in grazing systems by implementation of various strategies, in which improvement of genetic resistance of small ruminant should be included. Therefore, selection for resistant hosts can be considered as one of the sustainable control strategy, although it will be most effective when used to complement other control strategies such as grazing management and improving efficiency of anthelmintics currently. © 2016 The Authors.},

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of flood timing and nitrogen management on the agronomic performance of irrigated rice in tropical lowland. Two experiments were conducted in a Dystrophic Haplic Gleysol during the 2007/08 and 2008/09 crop years. The experiments were carried out using the cultivars BRS Jaçanã and Epagri 109. Flood timing combined with timing of topdressing 90 kg ha -1 N was evaluated at 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after emergence. The experiment was arranged in a split plot completely randomized design, flood timing in the plots and N application in the subplots, with six replications. Late flooding as well as late nitrogen application resulted in reduction of phytobiomass, grain quality and yield of irrigated rice. Flooding is recommended at the beginning of tillering for cultivar that shows higher initial growth, while for slower growth cultivar, ponding water can be established until mid-tillering. Early flooding increases sheath blight severity in rice stems. For improved quality and productive potential of irrigated rice, early flooding period and efficient sheath blight control is necessary.},

	abstract = {A challenge common to all forest tree improvement programs is the long time interval of a breeding cycle. Moreover, the large size of trees, late trait expression and the extended time-lag between the breeding investment and the deployment of genetically improved material, make tree breeding a costly operation, more susceptible to changes in market demands, business objectives and climate change. The outlook of accelerating tree breeding and improving selection precision by marker assisted selection (MAS), thus became one of the driving principles of most forest tree genome projects. Although important advances were made in quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and association genetics, MAS did not make it in the ’real tree breeding world’. Limitations of early genomic technologies, coupled to the genetic heterogeneity of tree species and an overoptimistic assessment of the architecture of complex traits in such phenotypically plastic perennial organisms, largely explain this outcome. The inability to ascertain and make use of individual QTLs has caused a paradigm shift from trying to dissect trait components and determine their individual effects, to dealing with the aggregate of whole-genome effects to predict phenotypes by Genomic Selection (GS). Given the rapidly growing interest of tree breeders on this theme, this chapter provides an update on the current status and upcoming perspectives of GS in forest tree breeding. After a brief explanation of the basic principles and the main factors that impact prediction accuracy, the perspectives and the encouraging experimental results of GS in forest trees are reviewed. Concerns raised by tree breeders about GS are then discussed by reviewing the current knowledge in other species, while attempting to provide a roadmap for upcoming research and operational applications of GS. The prospects of GS in tree breeding are very promising to increase genetic gain per unit time through improved estimation of breeding (parent selection) and genotypic (clone selection) values, reduction of generation time and optimization of genome-directed mate allocation. Furthermore, the progressive accumulation of huge genotype and corresponding phenotype datasets in GS will provide an exceptional ’big data’ framework that should enhance our understanding of the connection between genome-wide elements and the observable phenotypic variation in complex traits. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014},

	abstract = {Background Our aim was to determine if a surgeon's behaviors can encourage or discourage trainees from speaking up when they witness a surgical mistake.; Study Design A randomized clinical trial in which medical students (n = 55) were randomly assigned to an "encouraged" (n = 28) or "discouraged" (n = 27) group. Participants underwent personality tests to assess decision-making styles, and were then trained on basic tasks ("burn" then "cut") on a laparoscopic surgery simulator. After randomization, students assisted at a simulated laparoscopic salpingectomy. The senior surgeon used either an "encourage" script (eg, "Your opinion is important.") or a "discourage" script (eg, "Do what I say. Save questions for next time."). Otherwise, the surgery was conducted identically. Subsequently, a surgical mistake was made by the senior surgeon when he instructed students to cut without burning. Students were considered to have spoken up if they questioned the instruction and did not cut. Potential personality bias was assessed with two validated personality tests before simulation. Data were processed with Mann-Whitney and Fisher exact tests.; Results The students in the encouraged group were significantly more likely to speak up (23 of 28 [82%] vs 8 of 27 [30%]; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in personality traits, student training level (p = 1.0), or sex (p = 0.53).; Conclusions A discouraging environment decreases the frequency with which trainees speak up when witnessing a surgical error. The senior surgeon plays an important role in improving intraoperative communication between junior and senior clinicians and can enhance patient safety. © 2014 American College of Surgeons.},

	abstract = {Heat stress has adverse effects on the reproductive performances of dairy cattle and buffaloes. The dairy sector is a more vulnerable to global warming and climate change. The temperature humidity index (THI) is the widely used index to measure the magnitude of heat stress in animals. The objective of this paper was to assess the decline in performances of reproductive traits such as service period, conception rate and pregnancy rate of dairy cattle and buffaloes with respect to increase in THI. The review stated that service period in cattle is affected by season of calving for which cows calved in summer had the longest service period. The conception rate and pregnancy rate in dairy cattle were found decreased above THI 72 while a significant decline in reproductive performances of buffaloes was observed above threshold THI 75. The non-heat stress zone (HSZ) (October to March) is favorable for optimum reproductive performance, while fertility is depressed in HSZ (April to September) and critical HSZ (CHSZ) (May and June). Heat stress in animals has been associated with reduced fertility through its deleterious impact on oocyte maturation and early embryo development. The management strategies viz., nutrition modification, environment modification and timed artificial insemination protocol are to be strictly operated to ameliorate the adverse effects of heat stress in cattle and buffaloes during CHSZ to improve their fertility. The identification of genes associated with heat tolerance, its incorporation into breeding program and the inclusion of THI covariate effects in selection index should be targeted for genetic evaluation of dairy animals in the hot climate. © Dash, et al.},

The main general objective and long-term goal of in situ conservation of species is to protect, manage, and monitor the populations in their natural habitats. In ex situ conservation, CWRs require adequate isolation from related species during regeneration to avoid gene flow between species. The genes that come from CWR can make a direct contribution to human well-being and poverty alleviation, by increasing food production and quality and ensuring long-term food security. A key research area for CWR and climate change is the identification of adaptive traits contained in CWR that could be used by breeders for developing crop varieties that can adapt to specific environments. © 2015 Wiley-Blackwell.

	abstract = {Drought is the most important environmental stress affecting agricultural productivity worldwide. Breeding of drought-tolerant crops is important in order to meet demands of food security in the face of an ever increasing world population, global warming and water shortage. Drought resistance (DR) is defined as the mechanism causing minimum loss of yield in a water deficit environment relative to the maximum yield in a water constraint free management of the crop. Plants have evolved several mechanisms to cope with water deficit stress which includes drought escape and drought tolerance. Plant breeders and physiologists have identified some important traits associated with DR in crop plants. Many of these traits relate to making appropriate use of water when it is available, often with the aim of ensuring reproductive success and grain yield. Traits associated with DR serve as important breeding tools in identifying stress-resistant genotypes and in introgressing the resistance traits into high yielding genotypes. Marker-assisted selection based around screening for desirable alleles at QTL for DR is an important approach for improving DR in crops. Dissecting these complex phenotypic traits into simpler heritable traits has led to the identification of genes associated with some QTLs for DR. Breeding for DR has met with limited success following either empirical or marker-assisted selection approach. It is essential to integrate crop physiology, functional genomics and breeding approaches to dissect complex DR traits, understand the molecular basis of DR and develop improved cultivars to adapt to the changing climate. This chapter focuses on the DR traits important for agricultural productivity in major crops, i.e. wheat and rice. The physiological and genetic basis of traits is discussed to highlight the complexity of the quantitative traits and the need to integrate this information in breeding drought-resistant crops. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {Objective: Nocturnal eating behavior is shared by patients affected by a parasomnia, sleep-related eating disorder (SRED), and several eating disorders such as night eating syndrome (NES) and binge-eating disorder (BED); however, the differential clinical features of these patients have been poorly studied, with persisting difficulties in defining the borders between these pathologies. The aim of this study was to evaluate polysomnographic and personality characteristics of nocturnal eaters to further differentiate the syndromes. Methods: During a period of six months, consecutive patients complaining of nocturnal eating were asked to participate to the study. Twenty-four patients who were found to eat during the polysomnographic recording (PSG) study, and gender-matched control subjects were included. All subjects underwent a full-night video-PSG study and a psychometric assessment including the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2), the self-rating Bulimic Investigatory Test-Edinburgh (BITE), the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS). Results: Nocturnal eaters showed a mild reduction in sleep efficiency and duration due to a moderate sleep fragmentation, whereas the percentage of each sleep stage was not significantly affected. Nocturnal eaters scored higher at many subscales of the EDI-2, at the BITE symptoms subscale, and at the BIS attentional impulsivity subscale. Conclusion: The psychological characteristics found in our patients with NES seem to be typical for patients affected by eating disorders, and support the hypothesis that the nocturnal behavior of these individuals is due to an eating disorder; however, specific traits also allow differentiation of NES from BED. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Urban/peri-urban dairy production and sales has evolved as an adjustment to cope with food security and economic needs for urban dwellers in low-income countries and created an opportunity to transform from subsistence rural lifestyles of dairy farming to commercial engagement in towns. However, urban/peri-urban dairy farms differ in challenges from rural dairy farms and reproduction is important and critical for assuring sustainable economic output in both environments. Here we recorded for the first time differences between two geographically and economically different cities corresponding to different settings within the same country in managerial factors influencing reproductive performance in urban/peri-urban dairy cowherds. Results: The urban/peri-urban dairy farmers in the capital Kampala were more often male (P = 0.002) and commercialized (P = 0.0025), more experienced (P = 0.0001) and practiced zero-grazing more often (P = 0.05) than in the regional municipality Gulu. Also, the milk production per herd and cow (P = 0.0005) and calving rate were (P = 0.0001) higher in Kampala and artificial insemination was more commonly (P = 0.002) used than in Gulu. There was no difference in abortion nor neonatal mortality rate between the two locations. Overall, calving rates were higher (P = 0.0003) in smaller (≤3 dairy cows) and open grazing (P = 0.003) herds. Abortion rates were higher among dairy herds practicing late (≥5 months) (P = 0.003) calf weaning and in herds with commercial purposes (P = 0.0001). Neonatal calf mortality was lower (P = 0.01) in small herds. Conclusion: The study showed significant differences between Kampala and Gulu in reproductive performance and related husbandry factors for cows in the urban/peri-urban dairy farming systems. For several reproductive performance traits we found associations with husbandry and production traits, which should be taken into account when providing advice to the urban and peri-urban dairy farmers in the tropics. © 2015 Benon et al.},

Markers-trait association studies through identifi cation of QTLs and candidate genes for important traits are underway in several species including Poplar, Eucalypts, Pines, Spruce and Douglas fi r.

It shows that most published research on mammalian biology actually only deals with placentals, and explains the historical background to the lack of scientific interest in monotremes and marsupials. Montremes are a complex mosaic of derived, ancestral and convergent traits, defying the perception that monotremes are a "primitive" representative of an ancestral mammal. The section on marsupials discusses a series of specific claims made about the evolutionary accomplishment of marsupials; in particular, the efficiency of marsupial reproduction, metabolism and development, the impact of development of morphological evolution, and the ability of marsupials to compete for niche space with placentals. In all cases, intriguing differences between monotremes, marsupials, and placentals serve to highlight the broad spectrum of mammalian evolution, rather than indicate a succession of evolutionary stages with differing evolutionary "merit." © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

Milking traits of 97 Czech White goats, which were milked into a milk line, were studied using the Lactocorder® device (Lactocorder® WMB AG, Switzerland). Following evaluation of parameters of goat milk yield in different lactations the highest total milk yield were established in the II lactation goats. The longest duration of the total milking were established in the III and later lactation goats, while the time highest milk flow were established in the II lactation goats. Having analysed the duration of the milking phase, it has been established that duration of the main milking phase, duration of the plateau phase and duration of the descending phase in the III and later lactation goats were correspondingly 0.19, 0.25 and 0.26 minute longer than the average indicator (p < 0.05). The highest milk flow rate and the highest average milk flow were in the I lactation goats. Having performed the analysis of the assessments of the goat udder milking traits according to the udder score and the evaluation of the dairy breeding goats, it was established that the goats with higher assessment scores have better milking parameters. Previously, selection of the dairy goats were based on the assessment of the morphological traits due to lack of registration of the productivity data. Today, in addition to the productivity data, the goat farmers in many countries use milking parameters in selection as well. These are important parameters, which must be registered and evaluated, because they provide information, which can facilitate management of goat farming.},

	abstract = {Background: Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a highly abundant, diverse group of unique glycans that are postulated to promote the development of a protective bacterialmicrobiota in the intestine and prevent adhesive and invasive interactions of pathogenic bacteria with mucosal epithelia. Candida albicans, a prevalent fungal colonizer of the neonatal gut, causes the majority of fungal disease in premature infants and is highly associated with life-threatening intestinal disorders. Objective: The objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that HMOs protect human premature intestinal epithelial cells (pIECs) from invasion by C. albicans. Methods: To study fungal invasion, a quantitative immunocytochemical assay was used to distinguish invading from noninvading C. albicans cells in the presence and absence of HMOs. To understand how HMOs affect C. albicans invasion of pIECs, the expression of C. albicans virulence traits that are important for invasiveness (hyphal morphogenesis and ability to associate with host cells) were quantified. Results: Treatment with HMOs reduced invasion of pIECs by C. albicans in a dose-dependent manner by 14-67%, with a physiologic concentration (15mg/mL) of HMOs causing a 52% reduction in invasion (P < 0.05). The decreased invasive ability of C. albicans was associated with hyphal lengths that were;30% shorter (P < 0.05), likely because of a delay in the induction of hyphal morphogenesis after inoculation of yeast onto pIECs, which correlated with a 23% reduction in the combined expression level of hyphal-specific genes (P < 0.05). In addition, HMOs caused a 40% decrease in the number of C. albicans cells able to associate with pIECs at the time of hyphal induction (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These results, obtained with the use of a primary pIEC model, indicate that HMOs reduce virulence characteristics of C. albicans and suggest a role for HMOs in protecting the premature infant intestine from invasion and damage by C. albicans hyphae. © 2015 American Society for Nutrition.},

This might constitute a relevant threat to livestock improvement. Therewith, this study was carried out to assess the current genetic diversity and the phylogenetic relationships of the four native Senegalese cattle breeds (Gobra zebu, Maure zebu, Djakoré, and N'Dama). Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples of 120 unrelated animals collected from three agro-ecological areas of Senegal according to their phenotypic traits. Genotyping was done using 11 specific highly polymorphic microsatellite makers recommended by Food and Agriculture Organization. The basic measures of genetic variation and phylogenetic trees were computed using bioinformatics' software. Results: A total of 115 alleles were identified with a number of alleles (Na) at one locus ranging from 6 to 16. All loci were polymorphic with a mean polymorphic information content of 0.76. The mean allelic richness (Rs) lay within the narrow range of 5.14 in N'Dama taurine to 6.10 in Gobra zebu. While, the expected heterozygosity (HE) per breed was high in general with an overall mean of 0.76±0.04. Generally, the heterozygote deficiency (FIS) of 0.073±0.026 was relatively due to inbreeding among these cattle breeds or the occurrence of population substructure. The high values of allelic and gene diversity showed that Senegalese native cattle breeds represented an important reservoir of genetic variation. The genetic distances and clustering trees concluded that the N'Dama cattle were most distinct among the investigated cattle populations. So, the principal component analyses showed qualitatively that there was an intensive genetic admixture between the Gobra zebu and Maure zebu breeds. Conclusions: The broad genetic diversity in Senegalese cattle breeds will allow for greater opportunities for improvement of productivity and adaptation relative to global changes. For the development of sustainable breeding and crossbreeding programs of Senegalese local breeds, effective management is needed towards genetic selection and transhumance to ensure their long-term survival. © The authors.},

	abstract = {The present experiment was conducted on 60 randomly selected dairy units consisting of 116 graded Murrah, 70 Diara type and 121 nondescript type buffalo cows utilizing the procedures of stratified random sampling with proportional allocation (Snedecor and Cochran, 1967) in and around Patna (Bihar). The aim of this investigation was to study the effect of genetic and nongenetic factors on various morphometric traits of buffaloes under farmer’s management system. The morphometric traits included in the study were height at wither (haw, cm), body length (bl, cm) and chest girth (cg, cm) as well as body weight of the adult buffalo cows. The genetic factors were the three different genetic groups of buffaloes viz. graded Murrah, Diara and non-descript types prevalent in Bihar (India), whereas the non-genetic factors included in the study were location of herd, farming system and sequence of lactation. The farming system and the order of lactation had significant (P<0.05) influence on HAW, BL and CG whereas location of animals did not influence these traits. The animals managed under mixed farming system had significantly (P<0.05) higher estimates of morphometric traits than those maintained in the units involved dairying alone. The animals of firstorder of lactation had the lowest magnitudes of all the morphometric traits and significantly (P<0.05) increased upto third parity indicating that the skeletal maturity of the buffaloes might be attained at the age of 3rd parity. © 2014 Kasetsart University.

	abstract = {Independently, either drought or herbivory can have severe, negative impacts on growth, physiology, and survival of trees. When these two stressors occur simultaneously, their cumulative impact on tree performance is often assumed to be synergistic, i.e., greater than expected based on simple additive effects from either stressor alone. There are thousands of published studies on the effects of drought or herbivory, yet very few have tested the assumptions of their combined impacts on tree performance. Drought affects several physiological processes that reduce carbon assimilation, while herbivory elicits a number of carbon-expensive defense mechanisms. Given that both drought events and herbivory (e.g., insect outbreaks) are expected to occur with increased frequency and intensity with climate change, research on the effects from these combined stressors on tree performance is critical for predicting future forest health and productivity. In a study that did consider both stressors, the overall combined impacts were, contrary to assumptions, antagonistic because the effect of drought stress dominated tree growth and physiology, thus outweighing the effects from herbivory. Nevertheless, synergistic effects were observed on some plant traits when the relative intensities of each stressor were considered. Consequently, the impacts from combined drought and herbivory were trait-specific, intensity-dependent, and unpredictable from the effects of single stressors. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {Tail biting lesions have a negative effect on both the welfare of pigs and on the revenue of the pig farm. Due to the multifactorial nature of this abnormal behaviour and its sporadic onset, an epidemiological approach was adopted to identify the management and housing factors influencing the occurrence of tail biting and the frequency of bitten pigs in the weaning and fattening phases up to 170 kg live weight in heavy pig production. Data were collected from a sample of 67 commercial pig farms via an on-farm visit and a questionnaire to the farmer. Data collected included general farm information, hygiene and herd health, prevention, management, climate control, feeding and production traits. In the weaning phase, the occurrence of tail biting was increased by a factor of 16.64 for tipped vs. short-docked tails, by a factor of 68.09 when the observer detected poor air quality, and by a factor of 14.44 when the feeding time was variable. In fattening pigs, a high stocking density increased the risk of tail biting by a factor of 18.00. The frequency of lesions in weaners was greater in pigs with tipped tails (0.29 vs. 0.03%; P = 0.034), whereas in fatteners the frequency of lesions was greater when drinkers were not present in the lying area (0.71 vs. 0.05%; P = 0.009) and when air turnover was not detected in the barn (0.70 vs. 0.07%; P = 0.005). There was also a trend for increased tail biting when the stocking density was high (1.06 vs. 0.33%; P = 0.057). Many of the risk factors that emerged for heavy pigs in the present study could be easily managed to reduce the risk of tail biting and the frequency of tail lesions through the systematic evaluation and control of stocking density, climate, and feed and water management. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: For parents of a critically ill infant, good communication may help alleviate stress and anxiety. To improve communication, physicians must be responsive to families' needs and values surrounding the care of their hospitalized infant. Objective: We adapted a Decision-Making Tool for the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (N-DMT) to encourage consideration of family concerns and preferences in daily care planning. Design: This was a randomized controlled design. Setting/Subjects: Parents and providers of critically ill neonates were eligible. Parents were randomized to an intervention group (using the N-DMT) or standard of care. N-DMT information was shared through the electronic medical record and communicated directly to the primary provider. Measurements: Daily rounds on all infants were audio recorded. Parents completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at the first interview and 2 weeks later. Parents completed the Family Inventory of Needs-Pediatrics (FIN-PED) survey and an N-DMT-specific survey 2 weeks postenrollment. Results: Complete data were obtained on 10 control and 9 intervention families. Groups did not differ on demographics or mean infant Score of Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP) scores (36 versus 37). FIN-PED scores were similar for both groups. The control group showed decreased anxiety over time. The content of rounds did not differ between groups. The intervention group reported lower satisfaction with care, specifically in questions regarding communication. Conclusions: In this pilot study, we found that families in the intervention group were less satisfied with communication. Families who are primed to expect better communication, such as those participating in a communication intervention, may be less satisfied with standard care. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were to (i) compare models estimating residual energy intake (REI) using either lean and fat tissue growth or their proxy traits (average daily gain (ADG) and backfat thickness (BF)); (ii) determine genetic characteristics of REI at different growth stages and the entire test period; and (iii) examine 9 genetic and phenotypic relationships of REI with other production traits. Data from 315 pigs of an F2 generation were used which originated from crossing Pietrain sires with a commercial crossbred dam population. Average daily protein (APD) and lipid deposition (ALD), as measurements of lean and fat tissue growth, were obtained using the deuterium dilution technique on live animals. During growth from 60 to 140kg, REI was estimated using 4 different models for energy intake that included, besides other systematic effects, (1) ADG and BF; (2) APD and ALD; (3) and (4) incorporated the same covariables as the first two models, respectively, but pre-adjusted for systematic effects. Genetic parameters and estimated breeding values were obtained based on univariate animal models using REML analysis. Over the entire growing period, heritabilities of different REI using different models were all estimated at 0.44 and their genetic correlations were at unity. At different growth stages heritabilities for REI were greater ranging from 0.47 to 0.50. Genetic correlations between REI estimates at different stages of growth, obtained using genetic model 4, indicated that REI at 60 to 90kg was non-significantly (P>0.05) associated with REI at 90-120kg (0.32±0.29) and 120-140kg (0.28±0.28), but REI of the latter growth stages showed a significant (P<0.05) moderate genetic correlation (0.58±0.21). REI had favourable genetic correlations with feed conversion ratio (FCR, 0.84±0.13) and total nitrogen excretion (TNE, 0.85±0.11). The results indicate that REI estimated based on models using proxy traits for lean and fat tissue deposition resulted in slightly lower accuracies compared to models fitting APD and ALD, which explained a greater variation of energy intake. There is great potential for improvement of REI due to its large heritability. Genetic selection for REI should consider the stages of growth, because of their differences in genetic background. REI explained a large portion of variance in FCR and TNE, therefore selection for REI is expected to result in, besides improvement of feed efficiency, a substantial reduction in the environmental pollution of pig production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The growing field of conservation physiology applies a diversity of physiological traits (e.g., immunological, metabolic, endocrine, and nutritional traits) to understand and predict organismal, population, and ecosystem responses to environmental change and stressors. Although the discipline of conservation physiology is gaining momentum, there is still a pressing need to better translate knowledge from physiology into real-world tools. The goal of this symposium, "Physiology in Changing Landscapes: An Integrative Perspective for Conservation Biology", was to highlight that many current investigations in ecological, evolutionary, and comparative physiology are necessary for understanding the applicability of physiological measures for conservation goals, particularly in the context of monitoring and predicting the health, condition, persistence, and distribution of populations in the face of environmental change. Here, we outline five major investigations common to environmental and ecological physiology that can contribute directly to the progression of the field of conservation physiology: (1) combining multiple measures of physiology and behavior; (2) employing studies of dose-responses and gradients; (3) combining a within-individual and population-level approach; (4) taking into account the context-dependency of physiological traits; and (5) linking physiological variables with fitness metrics. Overall, integrative physiologists have detailed knowledge of the physiological systems that they study; however, communicating theoretical and empirical knowledge to conservation biologists and practitioners in an approachable and applicable way is paramount to the practical development of physiological tools that will have a tangible impact for conservation. © The Author 2015.

Few leaves coupled with the highest water use efficiency for CO2 assimilation was found in ‘BRS Kiriris’ in contrast to ‘BRS Jarina’ and ‘9783-13’. ‘BRS Caipira’ had high proline content in both Umbaúba and Frei Paulo areas, traits usually associated to drought tolerance, that contribute to the adaptation. It is also important to consider that cultivar ‘BRS Caipira’ was the first to present increase in chlorophyll content after extended period of drought, that indicates a faster recovery after dry season.

Such transmission has largely been examined for actinospores that are produced by myxosporeans infecting annelid hosts, but we also consider malacosporean stages released from freshwater bryozoan hosts where possible. We review the functional morphology of spores and how this relates to the invasion process and consider cues that initiate the discharge of polar capsule filaments for attachment and sporoplasm activation. We summarize initial invasion steps and discuss factors that may influence transmission ranging from spore viability and infectivity to host cues. We also describe what is known about portals of entry to fish hosts and how non-specific host recognition may enable some myxosporeans to infect a broad range of hosts. Such non-specificity could promote diversification if speciation follows the acquisition of new hosts. We conclude by recommending experimental procedures to be adopted when handling and harvesting actinospores for experimental studies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {Farming practice and career development in rural areas have become critical for ensuring increased job security, profitability, food productivity, environmental sustainability and ecological diversity. A thorough understanding of how relevant psychological factors affect the attitudes of agricultural students towards farming practice in rural areaswould greatly benefit rural development and agricultural education. The current study aimed to test the mediating effects of intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy regarding personality traits and rural practice in agriculture students. We first confirmed the factor structures of the scales of the personality traits, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and rural practice (n = 210), and then examined the mediating roles of intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy between personality traits and rural practice in agriculture students (n = 440). The results determined personality traits to be substantially associated with rural practice as well as partially mediated by both intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy. Through intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy, a structural equation model revealed that the predictive validity of agreeableness exceeded that of other traits, followed by openness and neuroticism. The investigation of intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy provides a dynamic approach to understanding how rural practitioners are cultivated. This examination also provides insight into the broader cognitive process involved in the formation of attitudes and intentions leading to actions. The results provide a foundation for further investigation regarding the association between motivation and efficacy in academic performance and in chosen career paths, and the linkage to student selection, coursework design, internship arrangement, and placement development. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {The residents of the state of Israel have been exposed to terrorism for more than 60 years. In 2012, Israeli and Palestinian civilians on both sides of the border witnessed yet another round of escalation of the ongoing conflict, leading to a full-scale military operation referred to as Operation Pillar of Defense. During this escalation, Hamas and Islamic Jihad forces in the Gaza Strip fired more than 1,500 missiles and rockets at Israel, aiming to reach cities and villages in central Israel. Previous research has demonstrated that certain intrapersonal characteristics related to personality traits are essential for dealing with the emotional stress of war. The goal of this chapter is to discuss the role of the personality characteristic of narcissism, which has been shown to play a key role in coping with stressful situations, but has yet to receive sufficient scientific attention. To address this gap, the current chapter will present and discuss findings from a recent study that examined how individual differences in pathological narcissism interact with trauma exposure and how that interaction predicts symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The study was conducted among 342 female Israeli adults as they faced different levels of potential ongoing threat from missile fire. The results of this study revealed an association between exposure severity and acute PTSD symptoms and GAD symptoms for individuals with high levels of pathological narcissism, but not for those with low levels of pathological narcissism. These results suggest that individuals with narcissistic personality features are at greater risk for acute anxiety symptoms following exposure to uncontrollable and ongoing life-threatening trauma, as compared to their low-level pathological narcissism counterparts. Clinical and theoretical implications will be discussed. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are a group of oxygenic phototrophs existing for at least 3.5 Ga. Photosynthetic CO2 assimilation by cyanobacteria occurs via the Calvin cycle, with RuBisCO, its key enzyme, having very low affinity to CO2. This is due to the fact that atmospheric CO2 concentration in Archaean, when the photosynthetic apparatus evolved, was several orders higher than now. Later, in the epoch of Precambrian microbial communities, CO2 content in the atmosphere decreased drastically. Thus, present-day phototrophs, including cyanobacteria, require adaptive mechanisms for efficient photosynthesis. In cyanobacterial cells, this function is performed by the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM), which creates elevated CO2 concentrations in the vicinity of RuBisCO active centers, thus significantly increasing the rate of CO2 fixation in the Calvin cycle. CCM has been previously studied only for freshwater and marine cyanobacteria. We were the first to investigate CCM in haloalkaliphilic cyanobacteria from soda lakes. Extremophilic haloalkaliphilic cyanobacteria were shown to possess a well-developed CCM with the structure and functional principles similar to those of freshwater and marine strains. Analysis of available data suggests that regulation of the amount of inorganic carbon transported into the cell is probably the general CCM function under these conditions.},

In this risk assessment domain, the EFSA Scientific Committee recognises the importance of more integrated ERAs considering both the local and landscape scales, as well as the possible co-occurrence of multiple potential stressors that fall under the remit of EFSA, which are important when addressing ecological recovery. In this scientific opinion, the Scientific Committee gathered scientific knowledge on the potential for the recovery of non-target organisms for the further development of ERA. Current EFSA guidance documents and opinions were reviewed on how ecological recovery is addressed in ERA schemes. In addition, this scientific opinion is based on expert knowledge and data retrieved from the literature. Finally, the information presented in this opinion was reviewed by experts from the relevant EFSA Panels, European risk assessment bodies and through an open consultation requesting input from stakeholders. A conceptual framework was developed to address ecological recovery for any assessed products, and invasive alien species that are harmful for plant health. This framework proposes an integrative approach based on well-defined specific protection goals, scientific knowledge derived by means of experimentation, modelling and monitoring, and the selection of focal taxa, communities, processes and landscapes to develop environmental scenarios to allow the assessment of recovery of organisms and ecological processes at relevant spatial and temporal scales. © 2016 European Food Safety Authority},

	abstract = {The key-step of epithelial-mesenchymal transition consists in a decrease of E-cadherin's cellular expression and a simultaneous increase of N-cadherin's cellular expression, in order to achieve the so-called "cadherins' switch". In carcinogenesis, the induction of EMT depends on various stimuli, both intrinsic and extrinsic. In fact, there are many potential metabolic pathways that can trigger the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, all of them lead to a final common effect, that is the decrease of E-cadherin's cellular expression and, consequently, the realization of EMT program. Recently, many molecular steps of this cellular remodelling phenomenon have been described, but there are still not perfectly clarified steps. The effective spatio-Temporal coordinates of EMT still remain unverified, and there are still doubts about the possibility that tumor cells with characteristics of local invasiveness and distance can only undergo a partial transition, with a contemporary expression of epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypic traits. In conclusion, the complete understanding of this process could lead to a revolution in oncology: I) through the identification of reliable markers able to radically modify the diagnostic and prognostic approach against epithelial tumors, in particular head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; II) through the development of biological therapies targeted to specific key molecules in the process of EMT, proposing the ambitious target of blocking the tumor invasion and metastatization processes.},

Pastoralists use variability in their livestock resources to manage high levels of environmental variability in economically advantageous ways. In pastoral systems, human-animal-environment interactions are the basis of production and the key to higher productivity and efficiency. In other words, pastoralists manage a production system that exploits variability and keeps production costs low. When differentiating, characterising and evaluating pastoral breeds, this context-specific, functional dimension of diversity in livestock resources needs to be considered. The interaction of animals with their environment is determined not only by morphological and physiological traits but also by experience and socially learned behaviour. This high proportion of non-genetic components determining the performance of livestock means that current models for analysing livestock diversity and performance, which are based on genetic inheritance, have limited ability to describe pastoral performance. There is a need for methodological innovations to evaluate pastoral breeds and animals, since comparisons based on performance 'under optimal conditions' are irrelevant within this production system. Such innovations must acknowledge that livestock or breed performance is governed by complex human-animal-environment interactions, and varies through time and space due to the mobile and seasonal nature of the pastoral system. Pastoralists' breeding concepts and selection strategies seem to be geared towards improving their animals' capability to exploitvariability, by- among other things - enhancing within-breed diversity. In-depth studies of these concepts and strategies could contribute considerably towards developing methodological innovations for the characterisation and evaluation of pastoral livestock resources.},

	abstract = {High calf mortality rate is a significant problem facing semi-domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) production around the world. Mortality rates, commonly due to predation, can range from 5 to 70%, which constitutes a great welfare concern. This study examined the influence of quantifiable maternal characteristics on reindeer calf survival. Data were compiled from 18 years' worth of records on the survival of calves in the Cairngorm reindeer herd (Scottish Highlands, UK). Overall, mortality rate of calves (n = 635) in the herd was 34.9% to six months old, rising to 47.8% by one year old. For both Total Calf Survival (including perinatal losses) and Postnatal Calf Survival (excluding perinatal losses) of calves up to six months old, the only maternal trait found to significantly influence calf survival was the age of the cow at calving. Calves of very young and old cows showed higher mortality rates. Only 40% of the cows were associated with 77% of calf deaths and it was demonstrated that there were significant individual differences between cows in relation to their ability to consistently rear calves successfully. These findings can be applied to reduce calf mortality within herds, guiding selection towards females with successful reproductive histories and with ages falling in the prime productive range (3-11 years old). Additionally, annual variation had a highly significant influence on calf survival with rising mortality over the recorded period, indicating a role of environment on survival and an avenue for further research to investigate the impact of external factors, such as climate and pathogen load on post-natal loss. © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

We collected genomic data and some functional annotations to construct a sorghum functional genomics database (SorghumFDB). SorghumFDB integrated knowledge of sorghum gene family classifications (transcription regulators/factors, carbohydrate-active enzymes, protein kinases, ubiquitins, cytochrome P450, monolignol biosynthesis related enzymes, R-genes and organelle-genes), detailed gene annotations, miRNA and target gene information, orthologous pairs in the model plants Arabidopsis, rice and maize, gene loci conversions and a genome browser. We further constructed a dynamic network of multidimensional biological relationships, comprised of the co-expression data, protein-protein interactions and miRNA-target pairs. We took effective measures to combine the network, gene set enrichment and motif analyses to determine the key regulators that participate in related metabolic pathways, such as the lignin pathway, which is a major biological process in bioenergy-producing plants.

	abstract = {Species distribution across geographic regions is greatly controlled by environmental temperature, especially when the animals are ectothermic. The current models of climate changes predict the increase of the average global temperature and the frequency and intensity of periods with extreme temperatures. These changes may have pronounced effects on ectothermic species capacities, survival and distribution. In fact, growing evidence demonstrates that environmental temperature is a particularly important factor in determining developmental rates, morphological, behavioral and performance-related traits, and final size of organisms. In reptiles, temperatures experienced by developing embryos determine offspring's sex (temperature-dependent sex determination). The incubation temperature also affects the duration of the incubation and the hatchling size, locomotion, and growth. Females of egg-retaining squamates lay eggs only when thermal environments are optimal for developing embryos. In this study, we examined the effects of thermal stress (both cold and warm ones) on the development of the oviparous Italian wall lizard Podarcis sicula. The results showed a severe negative impact of constant thermal stress on the viability of P. sicula embryos, resulting in lethality, reduced survivorship and abnormal embryonic development. A preliminary analysis on gene expression demonstrated changes in the transcriptome of lizard embryos in response to cold shock. These findings demonstrate that P. sicula embryos tolerate a very narrow temperature ranges and that thermal stress during embryonic development may be a critical factor for offspring adverse effects. This apparent higher sensitivity of embryos also suggests that many lizard populations will be most affected by global climate change, with severe reductions in hatchling production. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {Community assembly is the trajectory exhibited over time regarding species composition and community structure as species colonize an empty patch. Chase (2007) distinguish two basic types of assembly where a niche-assembled community is constrained by species interactions and competitive hierarchies whereas a dispersal-assembled community is unaffected by competition. The first wood-living (saproxylic) beetles to colonize a dead tree are sub-cortical, cambial-living species with a larval development-time of one year or less. Important community assembly events could therefore take place the first summer after tree death. Community assembly was studied during the eight weeks immediately after tree death. By exposing 0.5 m long stem sections (bolts) of Norway spruce, Picea abies, to colonization for increasingly longer times (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks) a temporal sequence was created. A total of 140 bolts at four forest sites in central Sweden were studied with six to eight replicates per site. Two of the sites were old-growth forest and the other two were forest sites subjected to burning right before the experiment started. I used community ecology measures to describe assembly patterns and emphasize findings that would have gone unnoticed in an analysis confined to the 8-week final state. In total 8802 beetles of 56 species were reared from the bolts. Two fire-dependent species were found in burnt forest, this is noteworthy since unburnt bolts were used in both forest types. The total number of emerged beetles per bolt was similar in the two forest types in early assembly but later this density was higher in the old-growth forest. During assembly the community-level carrying capacity was reached in old-growth forest but not in burnt forest. During assembly, community evenness and taxonomic richness was higher in the burnt forest than in old-growth forest but at eight weeks these community measures had converged. The two forest types became more dissimilar regarding species composition as the community assembly progressed. Old-growth forest also had a lower bolt-to-bolt variation in species composition than burnt forest. Cambivores was the functional group that made up the largest proportion of individuals in both forest types but the proportion was highest in old-growth forest. The proportion fungivores was highest in burnt forest. The proportion predators peaked early in both forest types and then decreased during assembly. In old-growth forest, 74 % of the bolts were numerically dominated by the cambivorous scolytine Dryocoetes autographus. In burnt forest only 33 % of the bolts were dominated by that species. Furthermore, burnt forest also had fungivores as bolt dominants, for example the fire-favoured corticarid Corticara rubripes, whereas old-growth forest bolts were always dominated by cambivores. In conclusion, the beetle assemblages in the two forest types followed different assembly trajectories. The beetle assemblage in burnt forest conforms to a dispersal-assembled community whereas that in old-growth forest conforms to a niche-assembled community (sensu Chase 2007). The biology of fire-adapted beetles is discussed in light of these findings. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The skilled movement of livestock by dogs is highly valued among livestock handlers in the harsh farming environment of Australia. However, their workload has not been studied empirically. This pilot study aimed to measure the distance, speed, and heart rate of a group of sheep dogs (n = 6) working during an 11-day period of peak activity (shearing). In addition, it sought to determine the technological capabilities and limits of a modern Global Positioning System (GPS) device for monitoring working dogs during peak work. Distances recorded ranged from 1.7 km up to 68.3 km in a day. The furthest cumulative distance covered by a dog during the study period was 279.2 km. The maximum speed recorded in the yard area was 37.01 km/h. Because of the limitations of the equipment and the nature of the work, we were unable to measure heart rate reliably. The GPS units used in the study were effective at measuring the considerable variation in movement and speed of the dogs while working. However, battery life limitations prevented recording of the dogs' full activity over each day. Characterizing elite and peak performance in these working dogs may assist in comparisons with other sporting and working breeds and in identifying phenotypic traits of value in herding and related working contexts. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Introduction Cooperatively breeding birds are species where “more than two individuals rear the chicks at one nest” (Emlen and Vehrencamp 1985), and were first described over a century ago by Australian naturalists (Ashby 1912; Boland and Cockburn 2002). Studies show that the social structure and mating patterns of such species vary widely, and may depend on numerous factors, such as phylogeny, number of individuals of each sex, levels of relatedness among individuals, habitat and climatic characteristics, among other possibilities. A relatively rare form of cooperative breeding is plural breeding with communal nesting (or joint-nesting), characterized by the occurrence of two or more breeding individuals of the same sex that care for the young. In such species, sharing of reproductive opportunities among individuals may occur among both males and females, and the degree of sharing generates reproductive skew that may vary from 0 (egalitarianism) to 1 (monopolization of reproduction by one individual) (Magrath et al. 2004). Here I describe the biology of the guira cuckoo (Guira guira), a species that combines some of the customary cooperative breeding traits with the added complexities of plural breeding in communal nests. The questions I have subjected to in-depth investigation over the course of this study include: (1) what are the possible selective pressures favoring the evolution of communal nesting? (2) can kin selection explain cooperation? (3) what are the costs and benefits of group living? (4) how does the group resolve conflicts? (5) is breeding relatively egalitarian or do some group members monopolize reproduction? and (6) can transactional models of reproductive cooperation and conflict improve our understanding of this system? The guira cuckoo Guira cuckoos (see cover photo) belong to the subfamily Crotophaginae, one of six subfamilies in the family Cuculidae. This clade is characterized by social nesting habits instead of the parasitic behaviors for which many of the other cuckoos are known. The Crotophaginae include four species that share the unique form of cooperative breeding described above: plural breeding with a joint-nesting system (Davis 1940, 1941, 1942). In these species, social groups consist of several females that lay their eggs in a single nest, resulting in a shared clutch of offspring. Worldwide, only a handful of species exhibit such characteristics, which inevitably raises questions about the convergence of taxonomic, evolutionary, and ecological factors that promote this breeding system. © Cambridge University Press 2016.},

In this paper, we consider crop phenotyping technology under three categories. The first is high-throughput phenotyping techniques in controlled environments such as greenhouses or specifically designed platforms. The second is a phenotypic strengthening test in semi-controlled environments, especially for traits that are difficult to be tested in multi-environment trials (MET), such as lodging, drought and disease resistance. The third is MET in uncontrolled environments, in which crop plants are managed according to farmer's cultural practices. Research and application of these phenotyping techniques are reviewed and methods for MET improvement proposed. © The Author(s) 2015.},

US$15 billion, with an estimated tenfold return from the final product. This situation is in strong contrast to the almost complete lack of commercial deployment of genetically engineered (GE) forest trees (with the only exception being GE poplars commercially grown in China). Reasons for this discrepancy are the low-social acceptance of GE tree deployment, because of the perceived uncertainties about long-term risks for the natural forests that such plantations could cause, and the public demand for absolute transgene containment which is difficult to engineer without generating pleiotropic effects. In this review, we present the status quo of agricultural crop biotechnology with a special focus on GE trees. In the near future, the forestry sector will need to meet the increasing demands for timber and improved feedstock with regards to value-added products made out of lignocellulosics. GE in economically important forest trees can accelerate the domestication of these long-lived plant species in terms of high productivity. At the same time, the pressure should decrease on harvesting natural forest stands, which should remain unmanaged conservation forests for biodiversity preservation. © CAB International 2014 (Online ISSN 1749-8848).},

Of increasing concern is the trans-kingdom tendency for increased pathogen virulence that is beginning to emerge in natural, clinical and agricultural settings. The study of pathogenicity has revealed multiple examples of convergently evolved virulence mechanisms. Originally described as rare, but increasingly common, are interactions where a single gene deletion in a pathogenic species causes hypervirulence. This review utilised the pathogen-host interaction database (www.PHI-base.org) to identify 112 hypervirulent mutations from 37 pathogen species, and subsequently interrogates the trans-kingdom, conserved, molecular, biochemical and cellular themes that cause hypervirulence. This study investigates 22 animal and 15 plant pathogens including 17 bacterial and 17 fungal species. Finally, the evolutionary significance and trans-kingdom requirement for negative regulators of hypervirulence and the implication of pathogen hypervirulence and emerging infectious diseases on society are discussed. © FEMS 2015.},

Buffaloes were enumerated from 145 dairy units located in and around Patna Bihar. Genetic Groups had shown highly significant (p<0.01) influence on both the traits. The dry period varied as 130 (days) in Graded Murrah, 151 (days) in Diara buffalo and 150 (days) in non-descript ones. Farming system and location did not significantly influence these traits. Lactation order had highly significant effect on these traits. The dry period varied from157days in first lactation to 140 days in fourth lactation while calving interval varied from 466 days in the first lactation to 441 days in the fourth lactation. © 2014, Kasetsart University.

	abstract = {Embryo implantation is a key step affecting swine litter size, which is an important economic and reproduction trait in pigs. In order to investigate the effect of erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular receptor B2 (EphB2) on endometrium migration and attachment during swine embryo implantation, the mRNA and protein expression levels of EphB2 in endometrium implantation sites, endometrium non-implantation sites and ovary were detected in Meishan sows during pre-implantation, mid-implantation and post-implantation period using real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot. Differential expression genes were also analyzed in endometrium implantation sites and ovary during different implantation periods by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology. The qRT-PCR and Western blot results showed that EphB2 mRNA and protein expression curve was the same in endomtrium implantation sites and endometrium non-implantation sites during pre-implantation, mid-implantation and post-implantation period, with a first increase followed by a decrease, and its expression level during mid-implantation was significantly higher than pre-implantation and post-implantation (P<0.01). In contrast, EphB2 mRNA and protein expression curve in ovary during pre-implantation, mid-implantation and post-implantation period showed a first decrease followed by an increase, and the expression levels were significantly different among different implantation periods (P<0.05). RNA-seq results indicated that EphB2 mRNA expression during mid-implantation was higher than that of pre-implantation extremely significantly in endometrium implantation sites (P<0.01), and was significantly higher than that of post-implantation in ovary (P<0.05). By and large, EphB2 might play an important role in swine embryo implantation, and it's a potential candidate gene for litter size in pigs. },

	abstract = {There is growing concern about the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on marine organisms and ecosystems, yet the potential for acclimation and adaptation to these threats is poorly understood. Whereas many short-term experiments report negative biological effects of ocean warming and acidification, new studies show that some marine species have the capacity to acclimate to warmer and more acidic environments across generations. Consequently, transgenerational plasticity may be a powerful mechanism by which populations of some species will be able to adjust to projected climate change. Here, I review recent advances in understanding transgenerational acclimation in fishes. Research over the past 2 to 3 years shows that transgenerational acclimation can partially or fully ameliorate negative effects of warming, acidification, and hypoxia in a range of different species. The molecular and cellular pathways underpinning transgenerational acclimation are currently unknown, but modern genetic methods provide the tools to explore these mechanisms. Despite the potential benefits of transgenerational acclimation, there could be limitations to the phenotypic traits that respond transgenerationally, and trade-offs between life stages, that need to be investigated. Future studies should also test the potential interactions between transgenerational plasticity and genetic evolution to determine howthese two processes will shape adaptive responses to environmental change over coming decades. © 2014 Faculty of 1000 Ltd.},

	abstract = {In life sciences, and particularly biomedical research, linking aberrant pathways exhibiting phenotype-specific alterations to the underlying physical condition or disease is an ongoing challenge. Computationally, a key approach for pathway identification is data enrichment, combined with generation of biological networks. This allows identification of intrinsic patterns in the data and their linkage to a specific context such as cellular compartments, diseases or functions. Identification of aberrant pathways by traditional approaches is often limited to biological networks based on either gene expression, protein expression or post-translational modifications. To overcome single omics analysis, we developed a set of computational methods that allow a combined analysis of data collections from multiple omics fields utilizing hybrid interactome networks. We apply these methods to data obtained from a triple-negative breast cancer cell line model, combining data sets of gene and protein expression as well as protein phosphorylation. We focus on alterations associated with the phenotypical differences arising from epithelial-mesenchymal transition in two breast cancer cell lines exhibiting epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like morphology, respectively. Here we identified altered protein signaling activity in a complex biologically relevant network, related to focal adhesion and migration of breast cancer cells. We found dysregulated functional network modules revealing altered phosphorylation-dependent activity in concordance with the phenotypic traits and migrating potential of the tested model. In addition, we identified Ser267 on zyxin, a protein coupled to actin filament polymerization, as a potential in vivo phosphorylation target of cyclin-dependent kinase 1. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

	abstract = {The paper considers the problems in the adaptive evolution of life-history traits for individuals in the nonlinear Leslie model of age-structured population. The possibility to predict adaptation results as the values of organism's traits (properties) that provide for the maximum of a certain function of traits (optimization criterion) is studied. An ideal criterion of this type is Darwinian fitness as a characteristic of success of an individual's life history. Criticism of the optimization approach is associated with the fact that it does not take into account the changes in the environmental conditions (in a broad sense) caused by evolution, thereby leading to losses in the adequacy of the criterion. In addition, the justification for this criterion under stationary conditions is not usually rigorous. It has been suggested to overcome these objections in terms of the adaptive dynamics theory using the concept of invasive fitness. The reasons are given that favor the application of the average number of offspring for an individual, R(L), as an optimization criterion in the nonlinear Leslie model. According to the theory of quantitative genetics, the selection for fertility (that is, for a set of correlated quantitative traits determined by both multiple loci and the environment) leads to an increase in R(L). In terms of adaptive dynamics, the maximum R(L) corresponds to the evolutionary stability and, in certain cases, convergent stability of the values for traits. The search for evolutionarily stable values on the background of limited resources for reproduction is a problem of linear programming.},

	abstract = {Significant improvements of the resource-use efficiency of major crops are required to meet the growing demand of food and feed in the next decades in a sustainable way. Breeding for new varieties and modern crop management aims at obtaining higher and more stable yields by optimizing plant structure and function under different environmental conditions. The development and application of non-invasive methods to estimate plant parameters underlying heritable traits are key enabling components. To address this demand, recently an increasing number of imaging technologies have started to be applied in plant research to analyze various types of genotype collections. Some of these applications are mature and suitable to be scaled-up to higher throughput; others require validation beyond proof-of-concept. In this chapter firstly we present an overview of available methods while stressing the current limitations to be taken into account for correct interpretation of the results. Secondly, we focus on three different case studies by our lab demonstrating the applicability of multispectral, fluorescence, and magnetic resonance imaging for various research questions applicable to controlled environments and to the field. Taken together, these case studies highlight that a variety of non-invasive plant phenotyping methods are essential tools not only for functional genomics, but also for plant selection and breeding. In addition, these experiments underline the need of developing methods tailored to different plant species and at various cultivation systems and scales. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014},

Aedes albopictus occurs in all areas and Ae. aegypti colonizes only some restricted areas already occupied by Ae. albopictus. This study investigates the abiotic and biotic ecological mechanisms that determine the distribution of Aedes species on Reunion Island. Life history traits (duration of immature stages, survivorship, fecundity, estimated finite rate of increase) in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus were compared at different temperatures. These fitness measures were characterized in both species in response to competitive interactions among larvae. Aedes aegypti was drastically affected by temperature, performing well only at around 25 °C, at which it achieved its highest survivorship and greatest estimated rate of increase. The narrow distribution of this species in the field on Reunion Island may thus relate to its poor ability to cope with unfavourable temperatures. Aedes aegypti was also more negatively affected by high population densities and to some extent by interactions with Ae. albopictus, particularly in the context of limited food supplies. Aedes albopictus exhibited better population performance across a range of environmental conditions. Its ecological plasticity and its superior competitive ability relative to its congener may further enhance its invasion success on Reunion Island. © 2012 The Royal Entomological Society.},

	abstract = {In cereal crops, during the critical time of flowering, abiotic stresses cause massive yield reductions. Attempts to solve the problem using classical breeding methods have so far been unsuccessful. This is primarily due to the lack of focused, reliable screening procedures and the fact that yield components are controlled by complex gene networks. Although genetic approaches require the use of germplasm that shows a contrasting behaviour for a trait of interest, physiological and molecular studies are often based on plant lines with unknown ranking of these traits (e.g. abiotic stress tolerance). We have taken the approach to first develop a reliable and reproducible screening method to rank germplasm in terms of reproductive-stage abiotic stress tolerance. The high sensitivity of the young microspore stage of pollen development was used as a target for our screening method, enabling us to identify germplasm with higher resilience to cold (rice) and drought (wheat). This material was then used in comparative studies to identify differences in the tolerant and sensitive response to abiotic stress. In this chapter, we discuss the physiological differences between tolerant and sensitive germplasm and how this can be exploited to develop cereal lines with improved reproductive stage abiotic stress tolerance. © 2013 Springer India.

Drought is an abiotic stress factor of the environment, which reduces the yield from cereals worldwide. The effect of different previous crops on the productivity of common winter wheat genotypes was investigated under favor- able and drought environments. The investigated cultivars were grown in two successive years - 2006, which was very favorable for wheat growth, and 2007 when one of the severest and longest droughts in Bulgaria occurred. The genotypes were grown after four previous crops (bean, sunflower, grain maize and fodder maize) at three levels of mineral fertilization according to the type of previous crop. Grain yield and the productivity components were studied: 1000 kernel weight, test weight, number of productive tillers, plant height, number and weight of grains per spike. The correlations of grain yield with the traits related to it were analyzed after different previous crops under contrasting conditions of the environment. A marked positive role of bean as previous crop under drought condi-tions was established. Bean decreased with only about 9% the productivity of the wheat genotypes grown after it. The high negative effect of sunflower and grain maize was stronger under drought. The productivity of the wheat genotypes grown after these two predecessors dropped down with 22-25%. Fodder maize had an intermediate ef- fect. The cultivars grown after it decreased their productivity with about 21%, but it was the best predecessor for formation of 1000 kernel weight. Regardless of the year conditions, correlations of grain yield with its components were inversely proportionate to the "good" predecessors.},

	abstract = {Maize is highly genetically and phenotypically diverse. Tropical maize and teosinte are important genetic resources that harbor unique alleles not found in temperate maize hybrids. To access these resources, breeders must be able to extract favorable unique alleles from tropical maize and teosinte from their population genomic context, where they are linked with many undesired alleles that confer adaptation to tropical environments, ancient farming methods, or wild growth habit (in the case of teosinte). Long-term traditional breeding efforts have demonstrated the value of diverse germplasm to improve maize productivity, while also enhancing the genetic base of cultivated varieties. Genomics provides new opportunities to identify the genes affecting important agronomic traits and to estimate the wide range of allelic effects at such genes. New approaches to complex trait analysis, including joint multiple population analysis, genome-wide association analysis, and genomic selection, can leverage high throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies to improve our understanding of the genome-wide distribution of allele effects across the wide genetic variation in the primary gene pool of maize. Implementing this information for practical maize improvement remains a challenge. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014},

It is generally believed that because of the enhanced disease-masking ability of these "prey" species, numerous disease states may go unnoticed for a significant period. A veterinarian should be knowledgeable about this behavior trait and consider its possible effects when assessing the patient's health status. In some cases, the chronic disease condition may respond rapidly to treatment, whereas with other diagnoses, treatment is more frustrating. This article describes a selection of chronic disease conditions that one may diagnose in guinea pigs (e.g., hypovitaminosis C, trixacariasis, urolithiasis, dental disease), chinchillas (e.g., dental disease), and rabbits (e.g., dental disease, renal failure, cranial thoracic mass disease).

	abstract = {Lead (Pb(2+)) is one of the most abundant heavy-metal elements in the environment. Pb(2+) pollution has become increasingly serious in maize planting areas, especially in the southwest of China, which even threatens food security. In the present study, a RILpopulation derived from 178 (an inbred line with low accumulation of Pb(2+) in the kernels) and 9782 (a Pb(2+)-hyperaccumulator in the kernels) was used for QTL mapping. A molecular genetic map with the length of 1499.85 cM and an average inter-marker distance of 9.07 cM was constructed with 165 pairs of SSR markers. QTLs controlling Pb(2+) content in maize kernels were then analyzed to provide the basis for breeding elite maize varieties with low Pb(2+)in the kernels. Two QTLs, qPC1 and qPC4, related to Pb(2+) content in maize kernels were identified on chromosome 1 and 4, respectively. qPC1 was located between markers umc1661 and phi002, accounting for 11.13% of phenotypic variance with an additive effect value of 0.062. While qPC4 was located between markers umc1117 and nc005, explaining 5.55% of the phenotypic variance with an additive effect value of -0.044. However, there was no significant correlation observed between Pb(2+) content in the kernels and any of yield-related traits including ear length, ear diameter, kernel row number and weight of per-hundred kernels, indicating that yield-related traits would not be changed in the process of low-Pb(2+)maize breeding. This suggested that the Pb(2+)content in maize kernel under Pb(2+)stress was an independent genetic trait.},

	abstract = {Variations in meat quality traits are under complex genetic control and improvement has been hampered by the difficulty in their measurement. Several QTL have been reported for different meat quality related traits,but few genes have been described which explain large amounts of the phenotypic variation. The use of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker panels with predictive value for carcass traits have been evaluated for cattle and SNP are commercially available even though their predictive accuracy may be low in different breeds. To identify new molecular markers for meat quality,an association study was performed in 15 breeds of cattle using 389 SNP belonging to 206 candidate genes known to be involved inmuscle development,metabolism and structure. Fifty-four SNP belonging to 20 different genes were found associated with different growth,carcass and meat quality traits. Some of them were novel associations and other were replications of known associations. Among the former,the gene-network associated with the calpain/calpastatin system was shown to be associated with meat texture,although small effects are found for the examined polymorphisms. Novel associations also included SNP in AANAT which was associated with collagen (P=0.006),CAST with fatty acid muscle composition (P=0.00003),CYP1A1 with juiciness (P=0.0005),DGAT2 with physical traits (P=0.0009) and lipid content (P=0.01) in muscle,MADH3 with the myofibrilar fragmentation index (MFI) (P=0.01),NEB with weight (P=0.00009),PCSK1 with juiciness (P=0.002),PLOD3 with carcass performance (P=0.0009) and fatty acids (P=0.04),and PGAM2 and VIM with post-mortem maturation (P=0.00008 and 0.000005,respectively). These data provide a starting point to investigate the complex genenetworks underlying economically important traits which are of importance to the beef industry for the improvement of production efficiency and meat quality. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {High ambient temperatures, high direct and indirect solar radiation and humidity are environmental stress factors that impose strains on animals. Goats with production demands are vulnerable to heat stress in spite of their high heat tolerance. Depression of feed intake and reduction of milk production are commonly observed in heat-stressed goats. According to the theory of global warming, a relevant increase of drought is expected across the world, even though the effects will not be adverse in all regions. Regarding livestock systems, it is a strategic necessity to improve the ability of animals to cope with environmental stress by management and selection. A study on heat stress in a selected breed of dairy goats was undertaken to examine the relationship between milk production and heat stress. In hot climates, heat stress is a limiting factor in dairy production, impairing growth, milk production and reproduction. Therefore, the choice of some breeders in Southern Italy to breed high yielding Alpine goats with traditional Mediterranean extensive methods, might prove unsuccessful. The effect of the Temperature- Humidity Index (THI) on Camosciata goat milk production was investigated. One Camosciata goat flock was used for preliminary study. Two subsequent lactation periods (2009- 2010 and 2010-2011) of 95 goats were studied over 709 test days in total. The fat and protein contents of the daily milk output were used as production data. A multiple regression model was applied, including as fixed effects the litter size, days in milk*lactation interaction and the THI. Weather information from the test-days was used. Preliminary results reveal no effects of the THI on production traits. All models used were significant. The goats of this farm, even though they are reared in a hot environment, do not seem to be affected. However, further research is needed to confirm these results.},

	abstract = {Many natural disasters, including drought, result in crop production and quality losses worldwide and global climate change makes the situation worse. A wide range of strategies used to enhance the drought tolerance depend on the genetically determined plant capacity and sensitivity, as well as the intensity and duration of the stress. Understanding the physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance is very important in development of selection and breeding strategies. Among crop plants, wheat is the staple food for more than 35 % of world population and is often grown in water-limited conditions. Wheat anti-drought study is of importance to worldwide wheat production and biological breeding. For this purpose, a rich gene fund was created, comprising thousands of wheat genotypes with contrasting photosynthetic traits, productivity, and tolerance to drought stress, and both selected from the ancient, aboriginal varieties of national selection and introduced from the world gene pool, particularly from Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo (CIMMYT), International Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA), and other international centers. All these genotypes are grown in the field conditions on a wide area at the Absheron Experimental Station of the Research Institute of Crop Husbandry (Baku, Azerbaijan) under normal irrigation and drought. Numerous winter durum (Triticum durum Desf.) and bread (Triticum aestivum L.) wheat genotypes were the main target of the research. The main parameters for selection of these genotypes were grain yield, plant phenotypic features (stem height, area and architectonics of the leaf surface, etc.), duration of the vegetation, and other morphophysiological traits, as well as drought resistance. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) spectra were analyzed in 220 bread (T. aestivum L.) and 46 durum (T. durum Desf.) wheat genotypes. Using primer P6 (TCGGCGGTTC), 920- bp fragment was revealed in 234 genotypes. Primer P7 (TCGGCGGTTC) produced a 750-bp band only in 203 genotypes. Results obtained by using both P6 and P7 primers match in 74 % of the analyzed genotypes: In 184 genotypes, specific loci were amplified by both markers. The obtained results show that these genotypes possess loci associated with drought tolerance. In 13 genotypes (total 5 %), none of the primers amplified specific fragments. So, the presented data could be used for monitoring the environmental stresses in field-grown plants and help in selection of stress-resistant varieties. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.},

	abstract = {Drug addiction is a complex and highly debilitating disorder affecting the motivational and cognitive control systems of the brain. This chapter reviews the astonishing advances made in the fi eld of drug addiction research by the non- invasive neuroimaging techniques, positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT). Based on the seminal discovery of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) by Olds and Milner, the great majority of PET and SPECT studies have targeted biomarkers linked to dopamine transmission in the brain. We review evidence that diminished dopamine D 2/3 receptor availability, whether pre-existing or acquired, is a risk marker for relapse to drug seeking, using examples of successful vertical translation from experimental animals to humans. We discuss the role of antecedent personality traits (e.g. novelty/sensation seeking, impulsivity) and the impact of brain disorders such as attention defi cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on the emergence of compulsive drug seeking. Finally, we consider future directions of PET and SPECT research and prospects for the development of novel radiotracers. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

	abstract = {Tree genomics are advancing at an accelerated rate thanks to recent developments in high-throughput next generation sequencing capabilities and novel biostatistical tools. Our ability to understand the wealth and structure of genetic variation in nature, plantations and orchards, as well as the processes of selection, adaptation and speciation will be limited in the future more by conceptual and analytical weaknesses than by the amount of molecular data available. The major facets of tree genomics, structural, functional, comparative, population, landscape and conservation genomics, as well as tree transcriptomics are the focus of this treatise. Reference is made to the state of the art means of surveying tree genomes, such as ETSs and SNPs. The structural aspects of tree genomes, the location and distribution of genes, with a focus on linkage analysis, genome mapping, map construction and the estimation of genome length are discussed. The analysis of functionally important information through functional genomics focuses on methods such as bulk segregant analysis, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and association mapping, in the effort to unravel the relationship of the genotype and the phenotype. Means to implement this knowledge in breeding, such as marker assisted selection (MAS) and genome-wide selection (GWS) are also presented. Moreover, the caveats of these approaches are pinpointed and discussed in an attempt to understand why, despite a wealth of pertinent research, their practical application is still limited. Population and landscape genomics are discussed in light of explaining quantitative and adaptive variation at the gene and molecular level that has so far remained elusive. The use of genomewide sampling to discern evolutionary processes and the spatially explicit patterns of genomic variation are detailed. A section on perspectives and the future of tree genomics is included as well. © 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

This study aimed to determine the presence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) - producing E. coli strains from poultry farms. A total of 45 Escherichia coli isolates recovered from 159 fecal samples of turkey, broiler and local fowls from 6 poultry farms in Owerri, southeast Nigeria were tested for antibiotic susceptibility and ESBL production by the double disk synergy test according to Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute guidelines. Location of resistant determinants of the ESBL isolates was established by plasmid curing and conjugation studies. ESBL was detected in 22.2% of E. coli isolates. The ESBL E. coli isolates were completely susceptible to imipenem, but resistant to cefepime, ceftriaxone, nalidixic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ampicillin, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim and ticarcillin. The ESBLs E. coli strains were all chromosomally-mediated indicating deficient transfer of antibiotic resistance traits to non-ESBL organisms. This study demonstrated the occurrence of ESBL E. coli strains in poultry and indicated an established reservoir in farm animals. Our finding warrants further molecular studies to prevent further transmission of ESBL organisms in this region. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.},

Classical plant breeding is based on genetic variability in many traits, including disease resistance and yield. Few studies have focused on natural variation in metal tolerance of crop and non-food plants although knowledge from such studies could lead to identification of starter germplasm for plant breeding toward development of cultivars suitable for different practical applications. These include new non-food plant varieties with enhanced metal tolerance and increased heavy metal accumulating capacity for phytoremediation or those new food crops with reduced heavy metal bioaccumulation potential to limit the threat of food safety from heavy metal contamination of food crops. In addition, studies on natural variation in tolerance to selenium (Se, an essential trace metal for the benefit of human health) among lettuce and broccoli varieties showed that Se biofortification is a promising approach. Moreover, contrasting phenotypes identified in metal toxicity screening of different varieties of a plant could be applied to aid improved understanding of metal tolerance and accumulation in plants. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

The suckling kid from this breed is a traditional meat product and, despite the good acceptance by the consumer, it is not recognised with a protected geographical indication or designation of origin mark. In order to give a first cognitive insight into the main productive and quality characteristics of carcass and meat, a total of 40 kids (20 males and 20 females) milk fed by their dams and slaughtered at 42 days of age were studied. In vitam and post mortem performance traits were registered. These included the sectioning in commercial parts and their dissection into the different tissue components: muscle, separable fat and the bone + tendon. Chemical composition, fatty acid and cholesterol content were determined from the longissimus dorsi muscle. Student's t test was applied to evaluate the differences between the sexes. In vivo parameters were similar between sexes, and differences between sexes were registered for height at withers, rump length and body length, with higher values in males. Males showed better carcass yields which were longer and with higher hip width. Carcasses, classified as first quality in both sexes, were characterized by a low content of adipose tissue and a good percentage of muscle, and showed the tissue composition similar between sexes, except for the lower content in muscle tissue of the leg from males. The low lipid deposit suggested the possibility to increase the age and weight at slaughter, in order to improve the commercial value of this product. The chemical composition of the longissimus dorsi muscle was similar between the sexes, while cholesterol content, oleic acid and MUFA (Monounsaturated Fatty Acids) were lower in males than females. In conclusion, meat had low cholesterol and lipids content, confirming that the Sarda suckling kid has an excellent nutritional value. © 2014, Edizioni Scivac. All rights reserved.},

Initially the nursery was raised in prewashed sand and then transplanted in pots each containing Johnson's nutrient solution as a medium of plant growth. There were four treatments: Well watered (WW), Drought at -0.6 Mpa (DD), Well watered + Si@150 mgL-1 (WW+Si) and Drought at -0.6 Mpa + Si (DD+Si). The experiment was laid out in CRD with 5 replications. Silicon applied wheat plants depicted marked enhancement in root shoot fresh and dry weights in comparison to plants grown without Si. More over, they maintained higher water status with increased leaf water potential and relative water contents and higher chlorophyll contents. It was concluded that Si is beneficial to improve the growth of wheat via change in the physiological and biochemical traits.},

	abstract = {Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd., 2n = 4x = 36) is an Andean broadleaf seed and vegetable crop of ancient origin. Quinoa represents one or two botanical varieties of a much broader tri-species complex native to North and South America and dominated by weedy forms of pitseed goosefoot (C. berlandieri Moq.) and avian goosefoot (C. hircinum Schrad.). This biological species complex includes at least two extant domesticated forms of C. berlandieri subsp. nuttaliae (Safford) H.D. Wilson and Heister: Mexican huazontle and chia roja. Within quinoa itself the two main limitations to the crop's improvement and dissemination are restricted access to cultivated Highland Andean germplasm and heat-stress susceptibility in the best agronomic types from the southern Altiplano. These limitations underscore the importance of the exotic gene pool for future quinoa breeding. A sophisticated tool box of DNA-based genetic markers and genomic resources has been developed to facilitate gene transfer from exotic sources in pre-breeding and accelerate the process of breeding elite cultivars. In addition, quinoa physiology and agronomy research have identified promising strategies and potential gene targets for improving yield, heat tolerance, maturity, and other traits critical to the expansion of quinoa into temperate and subtropical lowland production environments. The existing political climate in key areas of the Andean region, while unfavorable for the application of transgenic breeding approaches, should encourage accelerated efforts to incorporate MAS strategies in quinoa breeding. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

	abstract = {This study aimed to investigate the effects of chemical pollution with hexavalent chromium on the mental health of mothers with school/pre-school age children, residents of the area of the Asopos basin in Eastern Central Greece. The people of this area have been experiencing great threat regarding their health each and every day, as a result of the well-documented pollution by hexavalent chromium in drinking and ground-water, which is related to the widespread industrial activity, the usage of hexavalent chromium in various processes and the discharges of Cr-bearing wastes. The environmental impact of hexavalent chromium is a controversial issue critical to the protection of groundwater resources, as it affects the soil and the products from local cultivations used in daily food. This condition has been documented scientifically and was published in the mass media as a serious threat to human and animal life in the specific area. Although in Greece serious environmental-technological disasters have occurred during the last decades, there is a lack of studies on the possible consequences, including the psychological impact on the local population. The sample of this study included eighty-eight mothers of young children, residents of the area of Asopos, who were compared with eighty-eight mothers living in a non-polluted area - the area of Kiato in Northern Peloponnese, as a control group. They were assessed by the CES-D scale and the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale (STAI I-II), which have been standardized for the Greek population. Results indicated that depression and anxiety were significantly correlated with the place of residence [CES-D: t(169,496)=3.45, p=0.001; STAI I-II: A-state: t(174)=10,131, p=0.000; A-trait: t(174)=8,728, p=0.000]. Mothers from the Asopos basin reported more symptoms of depression (Mean=24,14, SD=11,345) than the control group (Mean=18,68, SD=9,625). Similarly, they have scored higher in both subscales of STAI I-II, measuring state and trait anxiety (A-state: Mean=49,66, SD=12,345; A-trait: Mean=46,76, SD=11,458) than the control group (A-state: Mean=32,24, SD=10,383; A-trait: Mean=32,32, SD=10,474). Regarding the anxiety as a personality trait (STAI-II), mothers in Asopos Area reported higher levels of stress that is likely to be associated with the long-term stressful situation of pollution. It could be assumed that mothers from Asopos Area scored higher in both anxiety scales, as a result of the environmental disaster that has been occurred in the area and the high risk that this poses to life. These results confirm relevant literature findings on depression and feelings of anger in regions that have suffered industrial or physical disasters, and suggest that fighting against chemical pollution in Asopos area also needs additional implementation with psychological support to mothers of children growing in the area. Up to date, no psychosocial support has been provided to the residents at the community level. Further research should be carried out in order to measure the impact of chemical pollution on the psychological well-being and health of all members of the local community.},

	abstract = {In the years 2007-2009, pot experiments on spring barley were carried out in greenhouse of Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation-State Research Institute in Puławy, using the Mitscherlich pots. The following cultivars were compared: ‘Basza’, ‘Conchita’, ‘Skarb’, and ‘Xanadu’ in terms of their response to 3 levels of nitrogen fertilization (NH4NO3): 1, 2 and 3 g N/pot. Doses of 1 and 2 g N/pot was divided into two parts: 60% before sowing + 40% at the end of tillering, and the dose of 3 g N/ pot was divided into three parts: 60% before sowing + 25% at the end of tillering + 15% before heading. Studied spring barley cultivars varied by grain yield size, grain yield structure traits and response to nitrogen doses. Cultivars ‘Conchita’ and ‘Xanadu’ had the higher grain yield and greater number of spikes per pot compared to ‘Basha’ and ‘Skarb’. Cv. ‘Skarb’ was characterized by higher total dietary fibre and insoluble dietary fibre contents in grains than other cultivars. Cv. ‘Xanadu’ was characterized by the highest soluble dietary fibre content. ‘Conchita’ cultivar showed a higher (1-3) (1-4)-β-D-glucan content in the grain than other cultivars. With the increase of nitrogen levels to 3 g N/pot, there was obtained significant increase in grain yield and number of spikes per pot in all spring barley cultivars, but the decrease of 1000 kernel weight. Comparing to other cultivars, the highest yielding cultivars ‘Conchita’ and ‘Xanadu’ showed greater percentage increases in grain yield and number of spikes per pot under the influence of increasing nitrogen doses to 3 g N/pot. At 2 and 3 g N/pot doses, the highest dietary fibre and soluble beta-glucan contents in spring barley grains was stated in comparison with a dose of 1 g N/pot. With the increase of nitrogen dose to 3 g N/ pot, there was showed significant increase in protein content in grain of all cultivars. Total dietary fibre, insoluble dietary fibre, and ash content in the grain of spring barley cultivars were not dependent on the nitrogen fertilization doses. © 2014, National Centre for Agrarian Sciences.

	abstract = {Climatic changes forecasted in the coming years are likely to result in substantial alterations to the distributions and populations of vectors of arthropod-borne pathogens. Characterization of the effect of temperature shifts on the life history traits of specific vectors is needed to more accurately define how such changes could impact the epidemiological patterns of vector-borne disease. Here, we determined the effect of temperatures including 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32°C on development time, immature survival, adult survival, mosquito size, blood feeding, and fecundity of both field and colonized populations of the Culex mosquitoes Culex pipiens L., Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Culex restuans Theobald. Our results demonstrate that temperature significantly affects all of these traits, yet also that the extent of this effect is at times incongruent among temperatures, as well as being population and species-specific. Comparisons of colonized mosquitoes with field populations generally demonstrate decreased adult and immature survival, increased blood feeding and egg production, and significant variation in the effects of temperature, indicating that such colonies are not fully representative of natural populations. Results with field populations in general indicate that increases in temperature are likely to accelerate mosquito development, and that this effect is greater at temperatures below 24°C, but also that temperature significantly increases mortality. Among field populations, Cx. restuans were most affected by temperature increases, with decreased longevity relative to other species and significant increases in adult and immature mortality measured with each incremental temperature increase. Despite the unique climates characteristic of the geographic ranges of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens, evidence of significant species-specific adaptation to temperature ranges was not seen. Taken together, these results indicate that geographic region, as well as species and population differences, must be considered when measuring the effect of temperature on vector populations. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.},

	abstract = {The free-living third-stage larvae (L3) of gastrointestinal nematodes are able to tolerate extreme weather conditions such as desiccation, but little is known about the consequent effects this has on their fitness. This study explored how the desiccation of Haemonchus contortus L3 larvae affected their absolute fitness by examining their success at consequent life cycle stages for a complete generation, and comparing them against a control. The stages examined include establishment, fecundity, larval development and pathogenicity. The results show that while desiccation greatly reduced the survival of the L3 prior to infection in sheep, their absolute fitness was not negatively impacted. Instead, it appears desiccation slightly augmented H. contortus fitness by triggering increases in fecundity. The study further explored what influence different gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) species (H. contortus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Teladorsagia circumcincta), isolates and age of L3 had on their capacity to revive following various periods of desiccation. The results showed desiccation tolerance varied as a function of each of these variables. The greatest L3 survival was found in Te. circumcincta followed by Tr. colubriformis and finally H. contortus. Significant variation was observed between individual species isolates and as a function of age. The results of this study carry important practical implications for the epidemiological understanding of gastrointestinal nematode species of economic importance. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Grass pea (. Lathyrus sativus L.) is an important cool-season legume species with wide genetic diversity spread across the continents. With the climate change scenario it has emerged as a viable crop option for fragile agro-ecosystems, where successful cultivation of major crop species is apparently not difficult. However, grass pea seeds are known to have a neurotoxin known as β-. N-oxalyl-. lα, β-diaminopropionic acid (β-ODAP). Its overconsumption as a staple food in an unbalanced diet for an extended period of 3-4 months can cause spastic paraparesis of the legs in human beings. Therefore, β-ODAP needs to be reduced through genetic means to a safe level for human consumption. Unfortunately, a paucity of efforts towards development of genetic and genomic resources for this species has hampered the progress in breeding low ODAP varieties in the past. Some progress has been made in recent years for collection, conservation, characterization, evaluation and utilization of Lathyrus genetic resources at the national and international levels, resulting in large ex situ collections in various gene banks of the world. These resources need to be systematically characterized and evaluated for genetic improvement through conventional and contemporary approaches. In spite of a large number of wild relatives with useful traits, no significant efforts have been made for alien gene transfer in grass pea. This chapter reviews the present status of genetic and genomic resources of Lathyrus and their use in current breeding programmes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 411 milch animals from 86 dairy farmers comprising of 172 indigenous and 239 Holstein-Friesian (HF) crossbred cows. These cows were maintained under farmer's management system in and around Gondar (Ethiopia) and were analyzed by Least squares analysis to study the magnitude of variation in their LL, LMY and PY due to genetic and some non-genetic factors. Result: The overall Least squares means for LL, LMY and PY were estimated to be 275.1165.23 days, 1407.3471.34 litres and 6.880.38 litres respectively. Genetic group and lactation order had significant effect (P0.01) on LL, LMY and PY. Season of calving had significant effect (P0.01) on LMY and PY but its effect on LL was non-significant. Effect of location of herd was significant (P0.05) on LMY and PY while its effect on LL was non-significant. Variations in all the traits due to herd size and farming system were statistically non-significant. Conclusion: Productive performance of dairy cows in this study was found to be lesser than the optimum values desirable for profitable milk production. © The authors.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to determine the effects of supplementation of vitamin E or propolis to bucks' diets on semen quality, oxidative status and hemato-biochemical changes during summer season. Thirty adult male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly allocated into three equal groups, 10 bucks each. Bucks received a maintenance diet supplemented by vitamin E (150. mg/kg diet, E-group) or propolis (150. mg/kg diet, P-group) or not supplemented (control, C-group) for ten consecutive weeks. Semen and blood samples were collected to analyze semen quality traits and hemato-biochemical parameters, respectively. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded daily and used to estimate the temperature humidity index (THI). Results indicated that bucks in the E- and P-groups had better libido (lower reaction time, P<0.05) and higher sperm concentration and viability than the control group (P<0.01). These enhancements were parallel to an increase in blood plasma testosterone concentrations in the vitamin E and propolis-treated groups (P<0.01). Additionally, concentrations of seminal plasma total protein and initial fructose were significantly increased in the semen of both treated-groups. For blood components, either vitamin E or propolis supplementation enhanced hematopoiesis including the number of red blood cells, hematocrite value and hemoglobin concentration (P<0.01). Also, concentrations of blood plasma glucose and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were increased, while those of blood plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were decreased (P<0.01) in both treated-groups. Supplementation with vitamin E or propolis enhanced (P<0.01) oxidative status of the blood plasma, whereas propolis-treated bucks had the highest value of total antioxidant capacity followed by vitamin E treated-bucks. Also, malondialdehyde activity was lower (P<0.05) in the propolis-treated bucks compared with the control, while bucks of the E-group were intermediate. In summary, inclusion of vitamin E or propolis in male rabbits' diets during the hot season could be used effectively to mitigate negative impacts of elevated temperature on semen quality, oxidative status and hemato-biochemical features. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Jatropha curcas L., a drought tolerant, monoecious perennial shrub, has gained attention in the tropics and sub-tropics during the past decade as a potential biodiesel crop. Adequate genetic diversity for key agronomic traits is of fundamental importance in crop improvement programmes particularly for crops such as J. curcas, which are in the early stages of domestication. In J. curcas, genetic diversity in local populations and worldwide collections has been estimated using both dominant and co-dominant molecular markers systems such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), inter simple sequence repeats (ISSRs), sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), etc. Assessment of genetic variation using molecular markers unequivocally established the existence of rich genetic diversity in the germplasm from Central and South American regions and narrow genetic base in populations from Asia and Africa. Establishment of phylogenetic relationships among Jatropha species using molecular markers has been limited to species naturalized and distributed in India. Research expansion over the past decade has indicated the availability of considerable genetic variation in the genus Jatropha for vegetative and floral traits linked to productivity, seed oil content, fatty acid profiles, toxicity (phorbol esters, curcin), etc. The diverse genetic sources identified in J. curcas germplasm and the compatible wild species need to be exploited for genetic improvement of the crop through conventional breeding and interspecific gene transfer, which could be further accelerated through marker-aided selection. © CAB International 2012 (Online ISSN 1749-8848).},

The performance of DM was compared with the commercially available activated carbon (CAC). Batch mode experiments were conducted with activated DM to study the effects of initial concentration of phenol, pH and the temperature of aqueous solution on adsorption. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms and kinetics were investigated. The experimental data were analyzed by the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin models and the isotherm data fitted well to the Freundlich isotherm with monolayer adsorption capacity of 6.189 mg/g. The kinetic data obtained at different concentrations were analyzed using a pseudo-first order and pseudo-second- order equation. The experimental data fitted very well with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The FTIR analysis revealed that carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups were mainly responsible for the sorption of phenol. Finally, the DM was found to be a promising adsorbent for phenol adsorption as compared to activated carbon.},

	abstract = {Although the spur-thighed tortoise, Testudo graeca, is one of the most widely distributed species of tortoises, its natural populations are threatened through its whole range. Particularly at south-eastern Spain, the species is mainly threatened by habitat destruction and over-collection, given that this chelonian has been traditionally considered an appreciate pet. As south-eastern Spanish wildlife recovery centers shelter hundreds of captive animals mainly coming from illegal trade or captive-bred, there is a strong debate about what to do with these animals: maintaining them in captivity all along their lives or reintroducing them to wildlife. It is well known that the reintroduction of captive animals supposes a risk for the wild population due to the uncertainty of their genetic origin and to the possible spread of infectious diseases. However, despite the increasing evidence that infectious agents are a potential health hazard for wildlife, little is known about the risk that introduced parasites could suppose for the wild populations of spur-thighed tortoise.The present study investigates for the first time the presence of helminth eggs and worms in faeces from 107 wild and captive individuals collected from mid-March to mid-June 2010, and relates the findings to different environmental and host variables. Sixteen oxyurid species and the ascarid Angusticaecum holopterum were identified. This last nematode and the oxyurid species Tachygonetria palearticus and T. seurati had not been reported in Spanish wild T. graeca previously. The prevalence of oxyurid eggs and worms were 94% and 70%, respectively; while, ascarid eggs and worms were found in 26% and 5% of tortoises, respectively. Ascarid infections affected mostly captive animals and were associated to caparace deformities and symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease (p<0.05). Oxyurid infections were not associated to negative health traits and prevalence increased with age. In free-living tortoises, the distribution of pharingodonid genera also varied according to habitat; moreover, T. longicollis, T. pusilla, T. conica, T. robusta and Mehdiella stylosa where significantly more frequent in wild compared to captive tortoises (p<0.05). Study results highlight important differences in the nematode fauna of captive and free-living tortoises and questions one more time if the reintroductions of captive animals suppose a risk for the wild population since the former ones can harbor and distribute among free populations pathogens like ascarid nematodes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Genetic progress in yield of staple crops is an urgent need in view of population growth. Predicted climate changes due to global warming necessitate that this progress is materialized in environments, which are affected more often by drought. Direct selection for yield under drought conditions is usually hampered by low heritability. Therefore, breeders rely on secondary traits with higher heritabilities to improve drought tolerance in agricultural crops. The present review gives an overview of methods that are applied for screening secondary traits. While for aboveground traits simple, reliable, fast, non-destructive and cost-effective methods that allow a highthroughput phenotyping are available, a bottleneck in drought research methods exists in the root zone, although there is evidence that roots are a key trait for superior drought avoidance. Still only few field screening techniques exist and most root screening is restricted to young plants and artificial growth media that limit inference to field grown adult plants. Spectral methods are identified as promising approach for both above- and belowground measurements and could bridge the gap between high throughput needs of breeding and complexity of plant physiological measurements. © CAB International 2013.},

For this reason, it is necessary to realize the new varieties the maximum of its genetic traits, even under different stress and climatic anomalies. The study is made of the main characteristics of the new quality indices common wheat varieties, developed of Dobrudzha Agricultural Institute - General Toshevo (DAI) which genetic traits belong to different qualitative groups. The study includes two contrasting meteorological terms in the year (2007 and 2008), and varieties grown in four previous crops and three levels of fertilization. The first year of the study (2007) is characterized by a severe and long-lasting drought, and the next (2008) - with favourable conditions during the vegetation of wheat. The effect of agronomy factors on the formation of grain quality in contrasting years was investigated. Analyzed is the change in quality indices of genotypes with contrasting environmental conditions. Established is main role in the formation of the variety of specific weight (TestW), sedimentation (SDS), the resistance of dough (DRes) and valorimetric value (VAL) under favourable conditions during the year. In years with stress (drought), mineral fertilization is essential for the wet gluten content (WGC) and volume of bread (LVol). Under the same conditions, differences between genotypes are aligned due to a stronger variation in quality indices. In years with favourable conditions differences between the studied varieties deepen, they are most pronounced for the specific weight (TestW), sedimentation (SDS) and bread loaf (LVol). Low quality and high quality varieties retain the level of quality, regardless of environmental conditions. The varieties with genetic potential for moderate quality reacted in different ways through their respective indices to the changeable growing conditions.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the influence of egg weight on chick-hatch weight, hatchability potentials and subsequent growth indices in chickens. Though the spectrum of factors that affect chick-hatchweight, hatchability potentials and subsequent growth indices in chickens is broad, however, increased interest in this concept is attributed to conflicting evidence in the literature indicating that performance in chickens in terms of chick-hatch weight, hatchability and subsequent growth indices in chickens may be closely related to the weight of the eggs and not by the hatcheries ability to effectively hatch eggs per se. This conflicting evidence in effect, creates a questionable atmosphere for chicken farmers as they are not appropriately guided on the influence of egg weight on chick-hatch weight, hatchability and subsequent growth indices in chicken. Often, the negative effect of this lack of proper guidance manifests itself in the farmer's inability to maintain a uniform chick-hatch weight and hatchability values in their poultry farms especially in rural farming communities. This becomes an important factor creating variability at slaughter age. However, based on re-evaluation of numerous research data, it is concluded that hatchability, post-hatch performance in terms of chick-hatch weight and growth parameters in chickens is influenced by egg weight when all other non-genetic factors are kept under control. This influence is breed or strain specific because chick-hatch weight and hatchability are interrelated heritable traits that vary among breeds, variety or individuals in a breed or variety. Thus, because of the important implications of these differences, sorting of eggs by weight prior to incubation might be advantageous in optimizing productivity of any chicken breed and in particular, help to minimize the variability at slaughtering age often observed in many poultry farms.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To reduce polymerization-induced shrinkage stress while maintaining mechanical properties, reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)-capable functional groups were incorporated into a photopolymerizable dimethacrylate-based dental composite. We hypothesize that the incorporation of trithiocarbonate-based RAFT functional groups into conventional dimethacrylate dental resins will reduce polymerization stress. Methods: A trithiocarbonate dimethacrylate (TTCDMA) monomer, capable of undergoing radical-mediated RAFT, is mixed with 70 wt% BisGMA (bisphenylglycidyl dimethacrylate) and compared to a conventional dental resin comprised of TEGDMA (triethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and 70 wt% BisGMA. The shrinkage stress and methacrylate conversion were simultaneously measured during polymerization. The fracture toughness and elastic modulus were measured to evaluate the effect of the TTCDMA monomer on the mechanical properties. All the materials used herein were evaluated as a composite, including 75 wt% silica fillers. ANOVA (CI 95%) was conducted to assess the differences between the means. Results: The TTCDMA composite exhibited a 65% stress reduction compared with TEGDMA-BisGMA though the reaction rate was slower than the conventional dental composite, owing to the additional RAFT reaction. The fracture toughness and elastic modulus of the TTCDMA-based composite were not significantly different than in the TEGDMA-based composite, while the T g was decreased by 30 °C to 155 ± 2°C. Significance: Despite only replacing the reactive-diluent, significant and dramatic stress reduction was observed while maintaining the elastic modulus and fracture toughness. This new RAFT-capable monomer shows great promise to replace the reactive diluent in BisGMA-based dental materials. Formulation optimization and further exploration of other RAFT-capable functional groups will provide further stress reduction in dental materials. © 2012 Academy of Dental Materials.

	abstract = {Objectives: Previous investigations on chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology characterized by tubulointerstitial damages (CKDu) in the North Central Region (NCR) of Sri Lanka have supported the involvement of social, environmental and genetic factors in its pathogenesis. Methods: We conducted a social-environmental-and-genetic epidemiology study on a male population in NCR to investi2014gate the genetic and environmental contributors. We recruited 311 case-series patients and 504 control candidates. Of the 504 control candidates, 218 (43%) were eliminated because of the presence of hypertension, proteinuria, high HbA1c, high serum creatinine or high alpha-1 microglobulin in urine. Results and Discussion: None of 18 metals measured (μg/l) in urine, including Cd, As and Pb, showed significantly higher concentrations in cases compared with controls. As speciation results showed that 75-80% of total urinary As was in the form of arsenobetaine, which is non-toxic to humans. None of the metal concentrations in drinking water samples exceeded guideline values. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to determine the genetic contributors. The GWAS yielded a genome-wide significant association with CKDu for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs6066043; p=5.23 × 10-9 in quantitative trait locus analysis; p=3.73 × 10-8 in dichotomous analysis) in SLC13A3 (sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter member 3). The population attributable fraction and odds ratio for this SNP were 50% and 2.13. Genetic susceptibility was identified as the major risk factor for CKDu. However, 43% of the apparently healthy male Lankapopulation suffers from non-communicable diseases, suggesting their possible influence on CKDu progression.},

	abstract = {In "De animalibus", the 7th book in the "Liber simplicis medicinae", Hildegard von Bingen describes the characteristics of four-footed land animals. Some of these have a special relationship with humans in that they embody moral qualities. An explanation for this is already given in the preface, which states that human intelligence recognizes these qualities, declaring that "You are this or that sort of creature". Since the relationship that animals have with nature shares a degree of similarity with that of man's, they can be regarded as symbolic representatives for particular human traits and characteristics. The article at hand presents Hildegard von Bingen's descriptions of the monkey, the lion, the bear, the rabbit, the dog, the cat, the wolf, the lynx, and the donkey. While the monkey just mimics man's behaviour and is imperfect in both settings, the lion embodies will power. The bear on the other hand stands for unbridled sexual desire, while in the rabbit the gentleness of a sheep is united with the bounce of a deer. The lynx is regarded as hedonistic, the donkey as stupid, and the wolf as surrounded by dangerous sylphs. In Hildegard's depictions, exotic and native animal species display rather extraordinary behavioural traits, and the medieval Christian world view of the author conveys unexpected relationships between humans and animals. In addition to empirical observation and experience, Hildegard also relies on folkloristic beliefs and magical practices related to explanatory models of her time. She allows largely unknown sources into her animal lore but never strays from her ultimate goal of having it serve to instruct people. In doing so, Hildegard removed herself far from the common tradition of medieval animal portraits.},

	abstract = {High temperature and drought are the most important abiotic stress factors which influence the wheat production in major parts of the wheat grown areas in Iran. This study was conducted to identify the proper criteria (morphological or physiological markers) for screening the heat and drought tolerant wheat genotypes under field conditions as well as to find out the sources of terminal heat and drought tolerance for utilization in the breeding programs. Under dryland, supplemental and full irrigation (exposed to high temperatures after anthesis), nine bread wheat genotypes were evaluated in three separate experiments at Gachsaran agricultural research station which is located in southwest of Iran in 2010-2011. This study showed the strong association between yield and canopy temperature under different intensity of drought (*P < 0.05, and **P < 0.01 under dryland and supplemental irrigation conditions respectively), and heat (**P < 0.01) stresses, indicating the trait potential as an indirect selected criterion for achieving genetic gains in heat and drought adaptation. It was concluded that the combined heat and drought stresses, considerably, reduced grain yield more than by either stress alone, but not with additive effects. Some genotypes, in particular, genotype 7 (T.AEST/SPRW'S'//CA8055/3/ BACANORA86) was identified as low CT value and high grain yield in all environments. This genotype was released through Agricultural Research, Education and Extension Organization (AREO) under the name of "Karim" in Iran in 2011.},

	abstract = {The way we view cancer has advanced greatly in the past few decades from simplistic approaches to finely honed systems. This transition has been made possible because of advancements on two fronts: the first is the rapidly expanding knowledge base of the mechanisms and characteristics of cancer; the second is innovation in imaging agent design. Rapid advancements in imaging and therapeutic agents are being made through the evolution from one-dimensional molecules to multi-functional nanoparticles. Powerful new agents that have high specificity and minimal toxicity are being developed for in vivo imaging. Here we detail the unique characteristics of cancer that allow differentiation from normal tissue and how they are exploited in nanoparticle imaging development. Firstly, genetic alterations, either endogenous or induced through gene therapy, are one such class of characteristics. Proteomic differences such as overexpressed surface receptors is another targetable feature used for enhanced nanoparticle retention. Increased need for nutrients and specific growth signals to sustain proliferation and angiogenesis are further examples of how cancer can be targeted. Lastly, migration and invasion through a unique microenvironment are two additional traits that are exploitable, due to differences in metalloproteinase concentrations and other factors. These differences are guiding current nanoparticle design to better target, image and treat cancer. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

The variables were statistically analyzed using randomization tests with software MULTIV. There was no significant difference between N levels, but there was among species and among functional types. Morphogenic variables are consistent according to the functional typology used as reference, based on leaf traits. Nitrogen fertilization does not change morphogenetic characteristics of evaluated species during autumn, and its use is discouraged during this season.},

	abstract = {Diarrhoea in neonatal and early-weaned piglets due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli-F4 (ETEC-F4) is an important problem in the pig farming industry. There is substantial evidence for a genetic basis for susceptibility to ETEC-F4 since not all pigs suffer from diarrhoea after an ETEC-F4 infection. A region on SSC13 has been found to be in close linkage to the susceptibility of piglets for ETEC-F4ab,ac. Potential candidate genes on SSC13 have been examined and although some polymorphisms were found to be in linkage disequilibrium with the phenotype, the causative mutation has not yet been found. In this study we are looking at the expression of porcine genes in relation to ETEC-F4ab,ac. With the aid of the Affymetrix GeneChip Porcine Genome Array we were able to find differentially expressed genes between ETEC-F4ab,ac receptor positive (Fab,acR+) piglets without diarrhoea and F4ab,acR+ piglets with diarrhoea or F4ab,acR- animals. Since the susceptibility to ETEC-F4ab,ac was described as a Mendelian trait, it is not so surprisingly that only two differentially expressed genes, transferrin receptor (TFRC) and trefoil factor 1 (TFF1), came out of the analysis. Although both genes could pass for functional candidate genes only TFRC also mapped to the region on SSC13 associated with susceptibility for ETEC-F4, which makes TFRC a positional functional candidate gene. Validation by qRT-PCR confirmed the differential expression of TFRC and TFF1. In piglets without diarrhoea, the expression of both genes was higher in F4ab,acR+ than in F4ab,acR- piglets. Similarly, TFRC and TFF1 expression in F4ab,acR+ piglets without diarrhoea was also higher than in F4ab,acR+ piglets with diarrhoea. Consequently, although both genes might not play a role as receptor for F4 fimbriae, they could be of great importance during an ETEC-F4 outbreak. An upregulation of TFRC can be a consequence of the piglets ability to raise an effective immune response. An elevation of TFF1, a protein involved in mucin formation, may also affect the piglet's capability to cope with ETEC bacteria, rather than being a receptor for its fimbriae. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The current decade (2010-2020), which has been dedicated to bone and joint diseases by the World Health Organization, is the right time to pay attention to musculoskeletal diseases of the orofacial system. Musculoskeletal diseases play a very important role at both the individual and the societal level, because they are generally extremely common in today's world. The development of a number of musculoskeletal diseases is closely related to decreasing age and increasing longevity, and is more common in females. Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are arthrogenic and myogenic disorders in the area of temporomandibular joints (TMJs) and/or masticatory muscles. TMDs show a greater frequency in females, and our open longitudinal study undertaken between 2001 to 2012 confirmed these epidemiological data, i.e., that TMDs are up to four times more frequent. Their main clinical characteristic is musculoskeletal pain and they are one of the most common causes of pain in the stomatognathous system. Magnetic resonance imaging was used as a 'gold standard' tool for diagnosing intra-articular TMD. The prevalence of clinical symptoms in the adult population ranges from 12% TO 42.7% and the need for treatment, from 3% to 9%. The etiopathogenesis of TMD has not been entirely explained and it is characterized by a multifactorial etiology, with a number of mutually interacting physical and psychosocial factors. Moreover, TMD constitutes the most common cause of nondental, musculoskeletal pain in the orofacial region. The biopsychosocial conceptualization of the pain experience is found in the close connection between pain and psychosocial factors. The relationship between the patients' psychological condition and their reaction to experiencing pain is very important, as are the pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic pain whose intensity is often independent of clinical findings. Untreated acute pain can evolve into a chronic form and become a separate illness. Psychosocial factors, as in other musculoskeletal disorders, play a dominant role and therefore the clinical and radiological findings tend to be disproportionate to the symptoms. Anxiety is the most common affective disorder and a great problem for psychiatry and general medicine. A certain degree of anxiety is normal and can serve as a warning signal of an external or internal threat and has lifesaving qualities. The negative effects of anxiety on the improvement of TMD pain complaints have not been completely explained. A psychological assessment was undertaken using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) according to age and sex-related reference values. Reversible, non-invasive therapeutic means are the recommended treatment, and dentists most often use the Michigan or stabilization splint. Other frequent options for the treatment of temporomandibular pain require a multidisciplinary approach, which may involve physical therapy and kinesiotherapy, acupuncture, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, biofeedback and psychotherapy. Anxiety plays a significant role as comorbidity with TMD-related orofacial pain. Regarding the important role of psychological factors in the development of temporomandibular pain, a system of multidisciplinary diagnosis is needed in TMJ diagnostics, such as STAI, a very easy-to-use psychological tool. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

To identify more kinases being potential for cancer therapy, we developed an integrative approach for the large-scale screen of functional genes capable of regulating the main traits of cancer metastasis. We first employed self-assembled cell microarray to screen functional genes that regulate cancer cell migration using a human genome kinase siRNA library. We identified 81 genes capable of significantly regulating cancer cell migration. Following with invasion assays and bio-informatics analysis, we discovered that 16 genes with differentially expression in cancer samples can regulate both cell migration and invasion, among which 10 genes have been well known to play critical roles in the cancer development. The remaining 6 genes were experimentally validated to have the capacities of regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and anoikis activities besides cell motility. Together, these findings provide a new insight into the therapeutic use of human kinases.

	abstract = {After an epidemiological analysis of psychiatric disorders as a consequence of burns and also psychiatric aspects of burn victims before the accident, this paper discusses the correlation between psychiatric disorders and burns from the epidemiological, etiopathogenetic and clinical-therapeutic aspects. Burn patients often suffer from psychiatric disorders and there is a clear connection between the extent and/or severity of injuries (TBSA) and mental illness, particularly anxiety, mood disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The occurrence of psychiatric disorders (mainly substance or alcohol abuse/dependence, suicidal behaviour, schizophrenia and personality disorders - antisocial or borderline) is a clear-cut risk factor for those with burn injuries. The occurrence or onset of psychiatric illness during burn hospitalization or recovery is a negative factor for wellbeing and also for the quality of life in the medium-long term. A burn injury is a traumatic experience for patients, not only as regards psychological aspects (no integration of the traumatic experience with self-perception of life) but also personal ones (knowledge of self-vulnerability, difficulty in accepting the new aspect of the body, with its possible deformation and scars) after trauma. All aspects which may refer to primordial and psychoanalytic fear of death must be taken into consideration. It is also necessary to consider the concepts of accident proneness and consequent pre-burn impulsivity, which may anticipate/represent a person's predisposition to a traumatic event. All these concepts have clinical and therapeutic importance for multidisciplinary care. This chapter focuses on the relationship between burn injuries and psychiatric illness: post-traumatic stress disorder (acute and chronic), affective disorders, and personality traits. They must all be examined not only as regards their outcomes but also the patient's pre-trauma psychopathology and susceptibility. Also of importance is facing therapy for all these disorders and its correlation with burn care (in terms of length of hospital stay, quality of life, and functional and psychological results). © 2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Lupins appear to have a mix of competitive and conservative water use strategies, with profligate water use and high rates of photosynthesis when water is freely available; coupled with high sensitivity to water deficits, whereby stomatal conductance is reduced, phytohormone concentrations and metabolism modified, well before changes in leaf water potential occur. With high root-shoot ratios and high hydraulic conductance, lupin roots are highly efficient at taking up and transporting water. However, the predominantly apoplastic flow in lupins cannot be regulated as flexibly as the symplastic water transport that is so important in cereals. Low rates of remobilization of pre-anthesis stored C in lupin forces the crop to rely almost completely on current photosynthesis, which exacerbates the effects of terminal drought, given that the species respond by reducing leaf area through abscission. Because of the past narrow focus on domesticated material it is not currently possible to put these observations in an ecophysiological context, to answer which of these attributes are characteristic of lupins as a species, and which can be expected to vary in response to environmental selection pressure. To advance our understanding of the species we advocate the study of wild germplasm specifically-adapted to habitats that impose contrasting drought stress, to address both the narrowness and short evolutionary history of the domesticated material, by highlighting responses to millennia of natural selection. By identifying the pros and cons of adaptive traits in an ecophysiological context our capacity to improve elite material will be considerably advanced. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Data on 517 lactation records of Holstein cattle maintained at Agricultural University Peshawar Dairy Farm in Pakistan from the period 1999 to 2010 were studied. The effect of various nongenetic factors i.e. sire, parity, season year of birth/calving on age at first conception (AFC) and calving interval (CI)were investigated using fixed effect model by GLM procedure of SAS 9.1. The effect of sire and season year of birth was highly significant (P<0.01) on AFC, whereas, highly significant effect of parity (P<0.01) and significant (P<0.05) effect of season year of calving on CI was observed. Mean AFC and CI were 709.9±71.9 days and 425.3±97.7 days, respectively. Under subtropical conditions the focus is always on milk performance while reproduction is often overlooked, due to which reproductive traits were found considerably inferior to those of temperate conditions. Even under subtropical conditions improvement trends were observed across years for both the traits. Therefore, managerial interventions supplemented by improved genetic potential are proposed to optimize these important reproductive traits.},

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of IL-8 gene can influence this gene transcription process and consequently its role and function. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify and analyze SNPs in the promoter region of IL-8 gene in Iranian native and Holstein cattle breeds (Bos Taurus). METHODS:Apart of promoter region of IL-8 gene was screened by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method and DNA sequencing. The multiple alignments were carried out for the nucleotide sequences of different SSCP patterns. In silico analysis was conducted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter region of bovine IL-8 gene was screened, to identify any association with transcription factor binding. RESULTS:Atotal of 4 distinct SSCP patterns were observed which by determining the nucleotide sequence, 2 SNPs were found at positions -126 and -180. The SNP at position -126 was found only in the native breed. The in silico analysis on location of transcription factors showed that SNPs identified at -126 and -180 created putative binding sites for Ik-2 and Oct-1 transcription factors, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The possible functional role of identified SNPs in this gene activity should be proved using gene expression analysis. Further studies required to evaluate the identified SNPs for disease resistant traits in cattle.},

	abstract = {Reducing water waste, and therefore the total volume of manure produced, is one of the ways to lower the environmental impact of intensive pig farming. The aim of this trial was to verify whether the absence of additional fresh drinking water could compromise the production traits or behaviour of liquid-fed heavy pigs. Sixty animals (initial BW 78. kg) were divided into two experimental groups, both fed a liquid diet (water-to-feed ratio 3:1 w/w). All pens were equipped with nipple drinkers; one of the groups had permanent access to fresh water (working drinkers-WD), whereas the other group had no water supply except that delivered with food (dry drinkers-DD). The pigs were housed in temperature- and humidity-controlled rooms. They were brought to a weight of 160. kg and then slaughtered. Hams were dry-cured according to the directives for Parma ham production. No significant differences (P>0.05) were observed between the experimental groups with respect to growth parameters (ADG and FCR), behavioural traits, blood parameters or the qualitative traits of carcasses (dressing out, lean meat yield, backfat thickness), meat (pH, colour, WHC, fatty acid composition of subcutaneous fat and tenderness) and cured hams (weight losses, sensory properties, chemical composition and oxidative status). With respect to drinking behaviour, a low number of visits to the drinker were recorded for both groups and data seem to indicate a high amount of water wasted by pigs provided with additional water delivery by nipple drinkers. Liquid feeding did not suppress drinkers use or drinker manipulation in both groups. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Bacteria are ubiquitous and important members of aquatic ecosystems ranging from inland lakes to the open ocean. Since the advent of molecular approaches for investigating bacteria community composition (BCC), the biogeography of aquatic bacteria Aquatic bacteria has been investigated across a wide variety of environments. In addition to illuminating important aspects of microbial ecology, these studies have unveiled the evolutionary relationships between freshwater and marine bacteria. It is now clear that marine and freshwater ecosystems are inhabited by evolutionarily distinct bacterial lineages, suggesting that environmental transitions across the marine-freshwater boundary have occurred rarely during the evolution of bacteria. In this chapter, we consider successful freshwater-marine transitions as a form of evolutionary innovation in bacteria. Here, we discuss recent genomic insights into the evolution of marine and freshwater bacteria, and the metabolic and physiological traits of aquatic bacteria that may either restrict or facilitate cross-colonization of freshwater and marine habitats. In doing so, we will also highlight the potential role that lateral gene transfer (LGT) has played in marine-freshwater transitions over the course of bacterial evolution. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

	abstract = {Background and AimsThe Senecio hybrid zone on Mt Etna, Sicily, is characterized by steep altitudinal clines in quantitative traits and genetic variation. Such clines are thought to be maintained by a combination of 'endogenous' selection arising from genetic incompatibilities and environment-dependent 'exogenous' selection leading to local adaptation. Here, the hypothesis was tested that local adaptation to the altitudinal temperature gradient contributes to maintaining divergence between the parental species, S. chrysanthemifolius and S. aethnensis.MethodsIntra- and inter-population crosses were performed between five populations from across the hybrid zone and the germination and early seedling growth of the progeny were assessed.Key ResultsSeedlings from higher-altitude populations germinated better under low temperatures (9-13°C) than those from lower altitude populations. Seedlings from higher-altitude populations had lower survival rates under warm conditions (25/15°C) than those from lower altitude populations, but also attained greater biomass. There was no altitudinal variation in growth or survival under cold conditions (15/5°C). Population-level plasticity increased with altitude. Germination, growth and survival of natural hybrids and experimentally generated F1s generally exceeded the worse-performing parent.ConclusionsLimited evidence was found for endogenous selection against hybrids but relatively clear evidence was found for divergence in seed and seedling traits, which is probably adaptive. The combination of low-temperature germination and faster growth in warm conditions might enable high-altitude S. aethnensis to maximize its growth during a shorter growing season, while the slower growth of S. chrysanthemifolius may be an adaptation to drought stress at low altitudes. This study indicates that temperature gradients are likely to be an important environmental factor generating and maintaining adaptive divergence across the Senecio hybrid zone on Mt Etna. © 2012 The Author.

	abstract = {Objectives: To produce a reduced stress dental restorative material while simultaneously maintaining excellent mechanical properties, we have incorporated an allyl sulfide functional group into norbornene–methacrylate comonomer resins. We hypothesize that the addition-fragmentation chain transfer (AFCT) enabled by the presence of the allyl sulfide relieves stress in these methacrylate-based systems while retaining excellent mechanical properties owing to the high glass transition temperature of norbornene-containing resins. Methods: An allyl sulfide-containing dinorbornene was stoichiometrically formulated with a ring-containing allyl sulfide-possessing methacrylate. To evaluate the stress relaxation effect as a function of the allyl sulfide concentration, a propyl sulfide-based dinorbornene, not capable of addition-fragmentation, was also formulated with the methacrylate monomer. Shrinkage stress, the glass transition temperature and the elastic modulus were all measured. The composite flexural strength and modulus were also measured. ANOVA (CI 95%) was conducted to determine differences between the means. Results: Increasing the allyl sulfide content in the resin dramatically reduces the final stress in the norbornene–methacrylate systems. Both norbornene–methacrylate resins demonstrated almost zero stress (more than 96% stress reduction) compared with the conventional BisGMA/TEGDMA 70/30 wt% control. Mechanical properties of the allyl sulfide-based dental composites were improved to the point of being statistically indistinguishable from the control BisGMA–TEGDMA by changing the molar ratio between the methacrylate and norbornene functionalities. Significance: The allyl sulfide-containing norbornene–methacrylate networks possessed super-ambient Tg, and demonstrated significantly lower shrinkage stress when compared with the control (BisGMA/TEGDMA 70–30 wt%). Although additional development remains, these low stress materials exhibit excellent mechanical properties which are appropriate for use as dental restorative materials. © 2012},

	abstract = {Plant resistance to drought relies on adaptive strategies based on the timing of phenophases and on the presence of structural traits mainly related to: (1) increase of water uptake and storage; (2) reduction of water loss during dry periods; and (3) mechanical reinforcement of tissues to prevent wilting that may lead to irreversible collapse and damage of cells. In this chapter, after a few evolutionary considerations, we focus on the adaptive value of the main phenological, morphological and anatomical properties. We report the common existence of such traits in both desert and semiarid environments, especially in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. All morpho-anatomical characteristics are interpreted considering that plant resistance to drought also depends on the ability to respond to multiple stressors. We conclude that various combinations of anatomical features can contribute in different degrees to the adaptive capacity of plants to drought. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

With these challenges in mind, the breeding program in a new EU country (Slovenia) was evaluated. All three national Breeding Associations joined the deliberations. The aim of this study was to develop an economic selection index for three breeds (Simmental, Brown Swiss and Holstein-Friesian) in Slovenia. Because farming circumstances differ within Slovenia, differences in the production systems were also taken into account; e.g., flat land vs. hilly/mountainous areas, and for conventional vs. organic farming. Economic values (€) were calculated for milk, fat and protein yields (€/cow/year/kg), survival (€/cow/year/%survival), calving interval (€/cow/year/day), and beef daily gain (€/cow/year/kg). Economic values were calculated by changing one of these traits whilst keeping the other traits at the default level. Economic indices were calculated using a farm economic model (Moorepark Dairy Systems Model). Herd parameters (e.g., number of milking cows, replacements, young stock and calving pattern), milk production, feed requirements and ration, land use and labour requirements were re-parameterised in order to be relevant to the Slovenian circumstances. Absolute economic values were slightly negative for milk yield for all breeds (-0.02 to -0.04€ per kg milk), but positive for milk components (0.55 to 1.45€ per kg fat, and 2.89 to 3.38€ per kg protein). High absolute economic values were calculated for survival (7.37 to 9.55€ per %). Absolute economic values for calving interval were approximately -1€ per day for all breeds, while the economic value for beef daily gain was 0.14€ per kg for Brown Swiss and 0.32€ per kg for Simmental. The constructed economic indices ranked bulls in a significantly different manner than how the Slovenian Total Merit Indices ranked the bulls. The economic indices were robust towards changes in prices and farming system. Ranking was most sensitive towards variation in milk price. Assumptions concerning feed intake in relation to growth influenced the economic value for beef daily gain. Assumptions regarding the farming system (i.e., organic farming systems) only slightly affected the ranking of the bulls. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The possible existence of autochthonous sandfly populations in Central Europe north of the Alps has long been excluded. However, in the past years, sandflies have been documented in Germany, Belgium, and recently, also in Austria, close to the Slovenian border. Moreover, autochthonous human Leishmania and Phlebovirus infections have been reported in Central Europe, particularly in Germany. From 2010 to 2012, sandfly trapping (740 trap nights) was performed at 53 different capture sites in Austria using battery-operated CDC miniature light traps. Sites were chosen on the basis of their climate profile in the federal states Styria, Burgenland, and Lower Austria. Sandfly specimens found were transferred to 70 % ethanol for conservation. Identification was based on morphological characters of the male genitalia and the female spermathecae, respectively. Altogether, 24 specimens, 22 females and 2 males, all identified as Phlebotomus (Transphlebotomus) mascittii Grassi, 1908, were found at six different sampling sites in all three federal states investigated. The highest number of catches was made on a farm in Lower Austria. Altogether, the period of sandfly activity in Austria was shown to be much longer than presumed, the earliest capture was made on July 3rd and the latest on August 28th. Sandflies have been autochthonous in Austria in small foci probably for long, but in the course of global warming, further spreading may be expected. Although P. mascittii is only an assumed vector of Leishmania spp. - data on its experimental transmission capacity are still lacking - the wide distribution of sandflies in Austria, a country thought to be free of sandflies, further supports a potential emergence of sandflies in Central Europe. This is of medical relevance, not only with respect to the transmission of Leishmania spp. for which a reservoir is given in dogs, but also with respect to the phleboviruses. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {Because obesity is associated with diverse chronic diseases, little attention has been directed to the multiple beneficial functions of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue not only provides energy for growth, reproduction and immune function, but also secretes and receives diverse signaling molecules that coordinate energy allocation between these functions in response to ecological conditions. Importantly, many relevant ecological cues act on growth and physique, with adiposity responding as a counterbalancing risk management strategy. The large number of individual alleles associated with adipose tissue illustrates its integration with diverse metabolic pathways. However, phenotypic variation in age, sex, ethnicity and social status is further associated with different strategies for storing and using energy. Adiposity therefore represents a key means of phenotypic flexibility within and across generations, enabling a coherent life-history strategy in the face of ecological stochasticity. The sensitivity of numerous metabolic pathways to ecological cues makes our species vulnerable to manipulative globalized economic forces. The aim of this article is to understand how human adipose tissue biology interacts with modern environmental pressures to generate excess weight gain and obesity. The disease component of obesity might lie not in adipose tissue itself, but in its perturbation by our modern industrialized niche. Efforts to combat obesity could be more effective if they prioritized 'external' environmental change rather than attempting to manipulate 'internal' biology through pharmaceutical or behavioral means. © 2012.

	abstract = {The understanding of how normal cells transform into tumor cells and progress to invasive cancer and metastases continues to evolve. The tumor mass is comprised of a heterogeneous population of cells that include recruited host immune cells, stromal cells, matrix components, and endothelial cells. This tumor microenvironment plays a fundamental role in the acquisition of hallmark traits, and has been the intense focus of current research. A key regulatory mechanism triggered by these tumor-stroma interactions includes processes that resemble epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a physiologic program that allows a polarized epithelial cell to undergo biochemical and cellular changes and adopt mesenchymal cell characteristics. These cellular adaptations facilitate enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased production of ECM components. Indeed, it has been postulated that cancer cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition to invade and metastasize. In the following discussion, the physiology of chronic inflammation, wound healing, fibrosis, and tumor invasion will be explored. The key regulatory cytokines transforming growth factor-β and osteopontin and their roles in cancer metastasis will be highlighted. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien. All rights reserved.},

Heterosis was in desirable direction for all the traits. Overall results revealed that crossbreds performed significantly higher than the purebreds. C × P recorded highest body weight amongst the crossbreds at 8 weeks of age. Heterosis (%) estimates for 8 week body weight, shank length and keel length were positive.

	abstract = {Sinocyclocheilus is a cave-dwelling cyprinid genus endemic to southwest China. Several species possess a conspicuous horn on their head, which has been suggested as a constructive troglomorphic trait but lacks substantial evidence. We used non-invasive, high spatial resolution synchrotron X-ray microtomography to investigate the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of the horn of Sinocyclocheilus hyalinus, one of eight such troglobiotic species. 3D renderings demonstrated the osteological components, which were comprised of a rear wall comprised of the supraoccipital bone, a remaining frontal wall with numerous fenestrae, and the bottom continuous with the parietal and epiotic. A horn cavity occurred within the horn. The fenestrae in the frontal wall were continuous in the horn cavity and showed elaborate channeling, and were, connected to the cranial cavity by soft tissue. We tentatively called this configuration the "otocornual connection" due to its anatomic and putative functional similarity to the otolateralic connection in clupeids and loricariids, which provide an indirect pathway to enhance perception of underwater sound signals. This study provides a functional morphology context for further histological and physiological investigations of such horn structures in Sinocyclocheilus cavefish, and we suggest that the horn might enhance acoustic perception to compensate for visual loss in subterranean life, which warrants future physiological examination as lab-reared S. hyalinus become available.},

	abstract = {Background: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive form of non-clear cell kidney cancer that typically affects young adults and is almost exclusively associated with sickle cell trait. Typical RMC patients tend to be young black males (2:1 male to female predominance) with sickle cell trait who present with pain and hematuria and are found to have metastatic disease at diagnosis. Prognosis is extremely poor, with a mean survival of less than a year in most cases. Case Report: We present a case illustrative of many of the classic findings of RMC. A 25-year-old female with a past medical history of sickle cell trait presented to the emergency room with right-sided flank pain. Initially, a computed tomography (CT) scan showed only a benign-appearing cystic lesion 4.5 cm in diameter in the right kidney. Six months later, the patient re-presented with hematuria, lightheadedness, and dizziness. A repeat CT scan showed that the renal cyst had enlarged to 5.6 cm. The patient underwent a decortication and fulguration procedure that revealed malignancy in the wall of the cyst. She was given a series of treatments but experienced progressive disease and passed away 2 years and 8 months after metastatic diagnosis. Conclusion: Neither systemic therapy nor radiation therapy has been found to be particularly efficacious in the treatment of RMC. As the underlying biologic mechanisms of RMC are further elucidated on a basic science level, we expect new translational research opportunities will emerge and novel treatment options will be developed for this rare and dismal disease. © Academic Division of Ochsner Clinic Foundation.},

The genetic correlations, phenotypic, Pearson and Spearman among weight gain and all other measurements were higher along the farming.

	abstract = {Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer death, yet it is mechanistically considered a very inefficient process suggesting the presence of some sort of (e.g. systemic) routes for fuelling the process. The pre-metastatic niche formation is described as one such metastasis promoting route. Now, the emerging potentials of tumor-derived microvesicles (TDMVs), not only in formulating the pre-metastatic niche, but also conferring neoplastic phenotypes onto normal cells, has integrated new concepts into the field. Here, we note as an ancillary proposition that, exerting functional disturbances in other sites, TDMVs (we have termed them metastasomes) may aid foundation of the secondary lesions via two seemingly interrelated models: (i) tumor-organ-training (TOTr), training a proper niche for the growth of the disseminated tumor cells; (ii) tumor-organ-targeting (TOTa), contribution to the propagation of the transformed phenotype via direct or indirect (TOTr-mediated disturbed stroma) transformation and/or heightened growth/survival states of the normal resident cells in the secondary organs. Respecting the high content of the RNA molecules (particularly microRNAs) identified in the secretory MVs, they may play crucial parts in such "malignant trait" spreading system. That is, the interactions between tumor tissue-specific RNA signatures, being transferred via metastasomes, and the cell-type/tissue-specific RNA stockrooms in other areas may settle a unique outcome in each organ. Thus, serving as tumor-organ matchmakers, the RNA molecules may also play substantial roles in the seeding and tropism of the process. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Empirical models are introduced for predicting probabilities of seed survival, loss of primary dormancy both in dry storage and during seed conditioning, and germination itself. Responses to environmental variables such as temperature and moisture can be quantified. It is argued that while several traits are conserved within species or genera, others are clearly adaptive and vary not only with seed age and between seed lots of the same species but also within seed lots, in which seed-to-seed variation can often be quantified by the normal distribution function. This may potentially allow practical use of the models to predict the behaviour of seed populations in the laboratory and in the soil seed banks. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

	abstract = {The greatest challenge facing humanity today is to feed tomorrow’s population of more than 9 billion people. Production has to increase by about 70% with the additional uncertainties associated with climate change, against a background of less land and less water being available for agriculture. More than ever before, this will require the wise use of plant genetic resources. Scientific advances such as high-throughput sequencing, marker assisted selection and direct manipulation of the genome have allowed breeders to identify traits and incorporate them into improved varieties more efficiently and more rapidly. The problem is that the genetic resources that are the foundation of these efforts are not being managed effectively. Ex-situ collections are currently scattered across roughly 1750 genebanks, many of which are in poor physical condition and which continue to be degraded as a result of insufficient and insecure funding. Many of the accessions are duplicates, which is a waste of precious resources. There is little publicly available information about the accessions. Crop wild relatives, which are so important for resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, are poorly represented in genebanks and in any case need also to be conserved in the wild so that they can continue to evolve in response to those stresses. There is an urgent need to address all these issues by building an effective global system for the conservation and use of plant genetic resources. It will require close collaboration and partnership to ensure efficiency, which in turn will require a commitment to a global system of access and benefit sharing as foreseen by the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. It will require secure and sustainable funding so that we do not have to go through this process again every few decades. And it will require a global information system that guarantees access to much more useful information as well as to the accessions themselves. The challenges are many and complex. As the paper will show, we have the means to meet them, if we engage strongly now, and if we do not, we have little hope of feeding the future population adequately. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014},

He proposes that the case of the woman corresponds to a brain disease, opposing the thought of an ovarian and uterine origin. He proposes a hypothesis of the psychogenic origin of the disease, the importance of what happened during dreams and beyond the conscience of the patient.

	abstract = {Monitoring studies of acanthocephalans in northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus Linnaeus, 1758) (NFSs) and a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina Linnaeus, 1758) were performed on St. Paul Island, Alaska, in July-August 2011. Gastrointestinal tracts of 105 humanely harvested NFS subadult males (SAMs) (3-4 years old) were collected during the annual Aleut subsistence harvest at four haul-out areas (HOAS): Lukanin (n=26 NFSs), Polovina (n=28), Gorbatch (n=30), and Morzhovyi (n=21). One gastrointestinal tract collected from a harbor seal (about 3-4 years old) found dead atMorzhovyi HOAS was also examined. The total prevalence of infection in NFSs with acanthocephalans was 29.52 % with variations from 7.69 % to 47.62 % between the four different HOAS. Eight acanthocephalan species of two genera - Corynosoma Lühe, 1904 (Corynosoma strumosum, Corynosoma alaskensis, Corynosoma cameroni, Corynosoma semerme, Corynosoma similis, Corynosoma validum, and Corynosoma villosum), and Bolbosoma Porta, 1908 (Bolbosoma nipponicum) - were found in the NFSs and a harbor seal. This is a new record of C. alaskensis for the NFSs. Short biological notes of the species found are presented. Differences in species composition as well as in prevalence of acanthocephalans parasitizing NFSs were observed in subpopulations from four different HOAS on St. Paul Island. The highest biodiversity of acanthocephalans and infection were found in subpopulations on Polovina and Morzhovyj HOAS, the lowest was on Lukanin HOAS. From 3.2 % (for C. validum) to 19.4 % (for C. villosum) of NFSs were infected by one acanthocephalan species; two species were found in 22.6 %; three in 9.7 %; and four in 3.2 %. Further studies of NFS parasites are necessary to follow the trends in parasitic infection rates and diversity in NFS population on the Pribilov Islands and for monitoring the influence of various ecological factors on NFS populations in Alaska. ©Springer-Verlag 2012.},

	abstract = {The present chapter analyses the cellular genomic status and type of cell divisions of pre-senescent cell populations shortly before the senescent phase. The purpose was to identify cellular mechanisms contributing to genomic unstable escape cells from senescence, in likeness with cancer recurrence from dormancy/remission periods. Primary diploid, human fibroblast cells were passage-extended to dysfunctional telomere-induced senescence (TAS) during which endopolyploidization occurred shortly before senescence. These cells either reduced genomic content to unstable near-diploid cells by irregular whole complement co-segregation, perpendicularly to the cytoskeleton axis or by nuclear fragmentation into multinuclear cells. The endo-division offspring-cells acquired genomic/chromosomal instability (CIN) from inheritance of endo-division traits, and gained proliferative freedom from contact inhibition by the perpendicularity of the endo-division. Other cells during this low proliferative period showed chromosomal aberrations and mitotic restitution, before a general change to senescent cells. The senescent phase showed change to typical cytoplasmic rich, amorphous flat cells, which were beta-galactosidase positive. Several types of escape mechanisms were observed (most frequent: nuclear bud-offs) which were associated with mitotic activity, albeit with limited propagation. These cells showed slight cell-shape changes from cell polarity change - a trait caused by endo-division perpendicularity. In experiments designed to simulate tumor therapy-induced genomic damage (to kill cells) endopolyploid cycling activity was increased before change to large amorphous, senescent cells. Young senescent escape-cells used the bud-off escape route, whereas escapes from old cells showed triangular cells in close contact with the senescent cells, which grew into three dimensional (3-D) tumor-like spheres. These observations were discussed as to tumor recurrence after prolonged dormancy/remission periods. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Microorganisms are vulnerable to invasion by mobile genetic elements such as viruses, plasmids, and transposons. The recently discovered Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-associated system, or CRISPR-Cas, is an adaptive immunity system found in most archaea and many bacteria that targets and inactivates invading foreign genetic elements. Cells with CRISPR-cas are more likely to resist the invasion and uptake of foreign DNA such as viruses, plasmids, and transposons. The aims of this study were to (1) compare the occurrence of CRISPR-cas in collections of endodontic (n = 34), oral (n = 21), and multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired strains of Enterococcus faecalis (n = 23) and (2) evaluate the distribution of antibiotic resistance and virulence traits among strains without CRISPR-cas. Methods: E. faecalis strains were screened for CRISPR1-cas and CRISPR3-cas by using polymerase chain reaction, and products were verified by DNA sequencing. Associations were investigated between the occurrence of CRISPR-cas and the expression of phenotypic traits (antibiotic resistance, gelatinase activity, bacteriocin production, hemolysin activity, and clumping response to pheromone). Results: CRISPR-cas determinants were present in proportionally more endodontic (25 of 34) and oral (15 of 21) strains than hospital-acquired (9 of 23) strains (P =.01 and.04, respectively). Significant associations were found between the absence of CRISPR-cas and the presence of antibiotic resistance in strains overall (P =.04) and bacteriocin activity in endodontic strains (P =.01). Conclusions: Evidence for the presence of CRISPR-cas in the majority of endodontic and oral E. faecalis strains raises intriguing questions as to how prokaryotic immune systems might modulate interactions within the polymicrobial endodontic biofilm environment. © 2012 American Association of Endodontists.},

The region (32° 20' N, 50° 51' E; 2061 meters above see level) is located in west Shahrekord. The results obtained from this study showed that high correlation was between seed yield and harvest index, also seed yield and biological yield in both stress and non-stress conditions. The results obtained from principal component analysis showed that seed yield, biological yield, number of spike per square meter and kernel weight were very variable in both of the environments. Kernel weight, number of spike per square meter, harvest index and grain-filling period have high diversity in oat cultivars and important for selection breeding programs.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of trailer design on the stress responses and meat quality traits of 3 different pig crosses: 50% Pietrain breeding with HALNn (50Nn), 50% Pietrain breeding with HALNN (50NN) and 25% Pietrain breeding with HALNN genotype (25NN). Market barrows (n=360), as a subset of 12 trailer loads of pigs, were transported from farm to slaughter on 6 dates in 2009 for 45min in either a pot-belly (PB) or flat-deck (FD) trailer, with 120 pigs/genetic group being represented. Temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) were recorded by data loggers mounted in both trailers. Behaviours and handler interventions were video-taped at loading, unloading and in lairage. At exsanguination, blood samples were collected for the assessment of lactate, cortisol, creatine kinase (CK), haptoglobin and Pig-MAP concentrations. Meat quality was measured in the longissimus dorsi (LD), semimembranosus (SM) and adductor (AD) muscles of all pigs. Temperatures were warmer in compartments 6 and 11 at loading (P<0.001), compartment 11 during travelling (P=0.05), and in compartment 5 at unloading (P=0.01) of the PB trailer. Pigs unloaded from the FD trailer overlapped more (P<0.001), whereas (P<0.001) the frequency of jamming was noted for pigs unloaded from the PB trailer. Pigs with 50% Pietrain genetics overlapped and jammed more (P<0.001) than pigs with 25% Pietrain genetics, regardless of HAL status. Greater (P=0.03) CK levels were found in 50Nn pigs transported in the PB trailer, while 50Nn and 50NN pigs had greater (P=0.028) lactate levels than 25NN pigs. Carcasses from 50Nn and 50NN pigs were leaner (P=0.04), and the skin damage score was lower (P=0.04) in 25NN carcasses. Overlap-type bruises were greater (P=0.02) in pigs transported in the FD trailer. Pigs transported in the PB trailer had greater (P=0.05) pHu in the SM and AD muscles (P=0.013). Except for pHu in the SM muscle, all meat quality parameters were affected by the Hal gene (P=0.04). The use of a PB trailer for short distance transportation of pigs to slaughter negatively affected stress responses and meat quality. The greater proportion of Pietrain genetics in the selection resulted in leaner carcasses, but also in pigs being more difficult to handle. Crossbreeding appeared to have a greater impact on animal welfare and meat quality than vehicle type, but trailer type may emphasize these negative genotype-related defects. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Globally, the conservation and restoration of viable populations of wild cattle species faces numerous common challenges. Among them are over-exploitation, habitat loss, population decline, hybridization and domestication. Domestication is prevalent among wild cattle species. As a state, it is the antithesis of wildness. As a process, it is driven by several factors, including selective breeding in captivity to propagate traits desirable for the owner and the market (Diamond 2002), and more subtly under captivity through non-intentional mechanisms (Theodorou & Couvet 2004; O’Regan & Kitchener 2005). Human exploitation of free-ranging animals can also induce changes in heritable traits (Darimont et al. 2009). Once lost from the wild or substantially altered by these forces, re-creating a wild species from domestic stock through selective breeding in captivity may involve heroic efforts to produce animals with external morphology similar to an original wild-type, but cannot restore traits previously shaped by natural selection. An example is Hellebrun cattle bred by the Heck brothers in Germany during the 1920s and 1930s in an attempt to ‘re-create’ the extinct aurochs (Bos primigenus) by selectively crossing domestic cattle breeds (Heck 1934; cited by van Vuure 2002; see also Chapter 15). Historically, the American plains bison (Bison bison bison) was perhaps the most abundant wild cattle species in the world, numbering in excess of 30 million (Shaw 1995). Numerous authors have chronicled its near extinction following European colonization and market hunting in the second half of the nineteenth century (Roe 1970; Isenberg 2000). Despite conservation efforts, today there are fewer than 20 000 plains bison in herds managed primarily for conservation, and >96% of plains bison (~400 000) exist under private captive ownership managed as livestock, primarily for commercial purposes (Gates et al. 2010; see also Chapter 9). Even including commercial herds, today American bison occupy less than 1% of their historical range (Sanderson et al. 2008). Despite its numerical abundance, Freese et al. (2007) declared that the plains bison is ‘for all practical purposes ecologically extinct across its former range’. Interest in restoring bison as wildlife and using them as an agent for restoring ecological services has increased during the last decade (Sanderson et al. 2008), yet there has been limited consideration of criteria by which bison can be considered wild in the sense of foundational evolutionary processes. © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

Growth hormone gene genotype AA was found in 62.9% of the cattle, heterozygous AB genotype in 24.4% and BB genotype in 12.7%. Genotype AA, with the highest frequency of 90% was found in Hereford cattle, genotype AB in 55.6% of Lithuanian Black and White and genotype BB in 37.5% of the old Lithuanian Black and White breed. Through investigation of the effects of genetic factors on the indicators of bovine milk yield and composition, the largest statistically significant impact of the growth hormone gene to the average percentage of fat content and milk yield was determined. It affected around 2% of the diversity of these indicators. Allele A of the growth hormone increases milk fat percentage, and allele B increases milk volume during lactation.},

	abstract = {Modern livestock breeding practices provide new opportunities for producing animals that are adapted to their production environment and are free of disease. Using current knowledge of biology and by seeking 'the desired outcome' animal selection strategies can be designed that deliver more precisely defined results so maximising genetic gain and minimising risk. This review briefly describes the evolution of genetic selection in livestock and considers some of the positive and negative aspects of selection practices over time. The selection of sheep to withstand gastro-intestinal nematode parasitism is used as an example to explain how developments in selection strategy have improved genetic progress for complex traits. Re-evaluation of the understanding of the outcomes of selection for parasite resistance is used here to examine whether a more sophisticated approach is desirable, and to propose a number of additional phenotype measurement strategies that could complement and improve the quality of information used for animal selection. Finally some ideas are presented for creating a situation where a designed, highly defined breeding objective might be used to increase precision and reduce risk. This may become possible via research to adapt or develop tools for more sophisticated phenotypic evaluation, to discover biological processes integral to desired breed changes, and to define desired animal types which match economic and societal expectations. © 2013.},

This article presents the history and evolution of Zerasca sheep, describes the breed's characteristics in terms of somatic and productive traits, managerial and health practices, meat quality; moreover it underlines its contribution to the preservation of the rural land and population of the Zeri district. First documentation on this breed dates back to the 19th Century. Zerasca breed has a medium-large size with white fleece. Males present horns while in females can be absent. Currently Zerasca ovine population totals more than 2,000 heads. Sheep husbandry is currently predominant in Zeri area thanks to the great availability of woody vegetation (oak, chestnut, hazel, alder and beech trees), meadows and pastures. Animals' nutrition depends mostly on grazing pastures, infact flocks are generally supported only with a little nutritional supplementation. The first typical production is the heavy lamb that is gaining more and more relevance thanks to its excellent meat quality, unique in taste; infact, Zeri lamb is included in the list of Slow Food Presidia, reflecting the recognized quality of this product in the world.Most of shepherds jointed in a consortium for the valorization and safeguarding of Zerasca sheep and lambs, whose regulation points towards the implementation of extensive farming systems with an optimal exploitation of local pasture resources. One of the most important problem that Zerasca sheep farmers often complain is represented by gastrointestinal parasitism, almost endemic in sheep husbandry and particularly in sheep raised under extensive systems. Today, "Zeri lamb" has a considerable economic impact on its territory, ensuring increasing profits for shepherds. The aim of this review is to collect information about a native breed in endangered status that it is gaining importance thanks to the high-quality of products.},

Maize MON 87460 contains a single copy of the csp B and npt II expression cassettes. Bioinformatic analysis of the flanking sequences and the open reading frames spanning the junctions created by the transformation did not raise safety issues. Comparative analyses established that, besides the expression of the CspB and NPTII proteins, some differences were observed in the composition of forage and grain produced from maize MON 87460 compared with its conventional counterpart, when grown under well-watered conditions. Given the magnitude of these changes and the characteristics of these endpoints, the EFSA GMO Panel concluded that the observed differences do not raise safety concerns for humans and animals. Under stressful conditions, maize MON 87460 can show enhanced agronomic performance characteristics and some differences in chemical composition in comparison with its conventional counterpart. Given the intended trait, the observed differences were not unexpected, and did indicate no safety concerns. The safety assessment identified no concerns regarding the potential toxicity and allergenicity of the CspB and NPTII proteins, or of maize MON 87460. Maize MON 87460 is as nutritious as any other maize and can be used in the same way. In cases of spillage, there are no indications of increased likelihood of the establishment or survival of feral maize plants MON 87460. Risks associated with a theoretically possible horizontal gene transfer from maize MON 87460 to bacteria have been analysed in detail, including different scenarios of integration, and did not raise safety concerns for the intended uses of maize MON 87460.

	abstract = {Livestock genomics has gone through a paradigm shift since the advent of genome sequencing that includes Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), Whole Genome Predictions (WGP) and Genomic Selection (GS). Beginning with a brief review of current progress and challenges in livestock GWAS, WGP and GS, opportunities for next generation methods are introduced that unravel the underlying systems genetics of complex traits and provide biologically meaningful and accurate predictions. Genome-Wide Epistasis Association (GWEA) and Weighted Interaction SNP Hub (WISH) network methods are introduced here to unravel complex trait genetics. These methods effectively address the problems of GWAS that have no ability to model and analyze genome-wide genetic interactions and thus do not capture any epistatic variance that could explain part of the missing heritability. Further, the Systems genomic BLUP (sgBLUP) prediction method is introduced in this paper as a next generation WGP or GS tool that can account for and differentiate SNPs with known biological roles in the phenotypic or disease outcomes and potentially increase the accuracy of prediction. It is emphasized that tools that link genetic variants to their functions, pathways and other biological roles will become even more important in the future. These tools include FunctSNP, Postgwas and NCBI2R which are briefly discussed. Genome-Wide Gene Expression (Transcriptomics) analyses using RNAseq technology are briefly discussed with some examples including results from our own pig experiments. In the last part of this review, systems genetics and systems biology approaches are introduced that involve joint modeling and analyses of multi-omics data types from genomics through transcriptomics (microarray and RNAseq), metabolomics to proteomics. It is shown using published studies that these systems approaches are valuable and powerful compared to stand-alone genomic methods in identifying key causal and highly predictive genetic variants for complex traits as well as in building up complex genetic regulatory networks. In all sections, some applications of next generation/-omics methods in livestock species (e.g. feed efficiency, growth, weight gain, fertility and disease resistance in cattle, pigs and sheep) are provided with references to relevant software and tools. In conclusion, this paper reviewed the current progress, lessons and challenges in livestock genomics and its ongoing transition to and opportunities for integrative systems genetics and systems biology in animal and veterinary sciences. Most of these integrative systems genetics and systems biology tools and methods presented here are equally applicable to plant and human genetics and systems biology. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the effect of nitrogen fertilization on agronomic and morphological traits of flue-cured tobacco, four flue-cured tobacco cultivars were grown at two contrasting nitrogen (N) rates (30 and 60 kg N ha-1), at two Croatian locations (Kutjevo and Virovitica) with different soil types, for two years (2010 and 2011). The higher N fertilization rate resulted in significantly higher yields, value ha-1, and area of the ninth leaf in 2010 while in 2011 between the two N rates differences were no significant. A significant cultivar x N fertilization rate interaction was not observed, and the traits evaluated were more influenced by year and location then by fertilization rate. Correlation analysis indicated that under different environmental conditions the pattern of correlations among important traits could be changed. The results suggest that 60 kg N ha-1 provided high yield of cured tobacco leaf without negative impact on its quality. The same N fertilization rate can also compensate the loss of nitrogen caused by leaching during the wet seasons.},

	abstract = {An ever-expanding scientific literature highlights the impact of the prenatal environment on many areas of biology. Across all major farmed species, experimental studies have clearly shown that prenatal experiences can have a substantial impact on outcomes relevant to later health, welfare and productivity. In particular, stress or sub-optimal nutrition experienced by the mother during pregnancy has been shown to have wide-ranging and important effects on how her offspring cope with their social, physical and infectious environment. Variation in the conditions for development provided by the reproductive tract or egg, for instance by altered nutritional supply or hormonal exposure, may therefore explain a large degree of variation in many welfare- and productivity-relevant traits. The scientific literature suggests a number of management practices for pre-birth/hatch individuals that could compromise their later welfare. Such studies may have relevance for the welfare of animals under human care, depending on the extent to which real life conditions involve exposure to these practices. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of extending the focus on animal welfare to include the prenatal period, an aspect which until recently has been largely neglected. © 2012 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare The Old School.},

The success of a breeding programme is dependent on the precise measurement of phenotyping traits and the ability to correlate these with gene or quantitative trait locus (QTL) expression. However, precision in phenotyping is a major obstacle because of the complexity associated with environment and genotype interaction. Plant phenotyping traits and their importance vary depending on the breeding objective. Phenotyping under abiotic stress includes a set of physiological traits that indirectly explain the stress tolerance and susceptibility of the genotype. Although a large amount of information is available on the methods of estimating these traits, there is minimum information on the significance of these traits under abiotic stress conditions. This chapter focuses on the different physiological traits available for phenotyping and their underlying principles and importance under stress conditions, and highlights the new temperature-controlled phenotyping facility. © 2013 Springer India.

As essential mediators in this pathway, Smad2 and Smad3 have been extensively studied and found to promote EMT and the subsequent mobility as well as invasiveness of lung cancer cells. In the present study, we determined that miR-136 directly targeted Smad2 and Smad3, leading to reduced migration and invasiveness of lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) cell lines, accompanied by increased epithelial markers as well as decreased mesenchymal markers. Moreover, ectopic expression of either Smad2 or Smad3 partially restored the malignant phenotype of ADC cells overexpressing miR-136. Taken together, our data demonstrate that miR-136 may play a tumor-suppressive role by repressing EMT and prometastatic traits via targeting Smad2 and Smad3. The potent antimetastasis property of miR-136 and its multitarget mechanism provide new insights in developing novel therapeutic approaches. Copyright © 2014 Cognizant Comm. Corp.},

Two irrigation treatments (rainfall+3 irrigations as water stress and rainfall+6 irrigations as control) were in main plots and 7 fertilization methods (control- no fertilizer, 10 t/ha manure- 10M, 5t/ha manure- 5M, 50 kg/ha nitrogen as urea- 50N, 5M+25N and seed inoculation with Pseudomonas putida and P. fluorescence) were in sub plots. Results demonstrated that seed and essential oil yield, plant height and umbel number per plant significantly declined in water stress conditions, but branch number per plant and essential oil and seed germination percentage were not significantly affected by water stress. In water stress conditions, the highest seed yield related to 5M+25N treatment. The effect of fertilizer treatments on plant height, branch number per plant and seed essential oil and germination percentage were not significant. In conclusion, results showed that manure could be used effectively to modify the impact of water shortage and to stimulate an increase in cumin seed and essential oil yields probably through improving the water holding capacity of the soil. Nitrogen application with manure improved the effect of manure application. Seed inoculation with Pseudomonas sp. demonstrated no positive effect on plant growth and yield.},

For centuries his masterpiece, the "Canon of Medicine", has been used as a major medical reference. The Canon, as a prime encyclopedia on medicine is comprised of five books. In the introduction to the Canon, Avicenna has described the purpose of medicine as the preservation of health if it is already attained and its restoration when it is lost. He defines health as a trait or state, which results in the normal functioning of the human body and presumes that health is a steady state, whilst disease is more of a variable concept. Thus whenever we depart from a healthy state, we approach disease. A comparison of current views regarding definitions of health, disease and their components as defined by Avicenna could open new horizons for ancient, traditional medicine. The Canon contains numerous implications concerning the infrastructures of public health-related issues. For example the specifications of healthy water and air are well described in the "Canon of Medicine". To enable a better understanding of Avicenna's viewpoints about public health, we have briefly reviewed his perspective on the topics of health, disease, and environmental sanitation concerning water and air.},

	abstract = {Future production conditions for beef cattle may become increasingly extensive due to human population growth, climate change and competition for resources, which may limit the amount of concentrates available for beef production. Therefore, the effect of more extensive production conditions on economic values (EV) in beef cattle breeding goals was investigated. Using a deterministic bio-economic model, two alternative production conditions were analysed in two breed groups (Continental and British): (1) entirely roughage-based (RB) and (2) minimum use of concentrates (MC). Three harvested roughage qualities (early, medium and late cut) were included in both scenarios, resulting in a total of 12 situations. Performance of bulls, surplus heifers and replacement heifers was assumed to vary considerably between the situations, while the performance of suckler cows was assumed to be constant. EV were estimated for seven functional traits: herd life of cow (HL), age at first calving, calving interval, stillbirth (S), twinning rate (T), calving difficulty, limb and claw disorders (LC), and for seven production traits: birth weight (BW), carcass weight (CW), carcass conformation, carcass fat, growth rate from birth to 200 days (weaning), growth rate from 200 to 365 days and growth rate from 365 days to slaughter. HL was the economically most important trait followed by CW in all situations, while S, T, LC and BW were of little economic importance. Little re-ranking for the traits was found between situations. The functional traits were more important than or equally important to the production traits for early cut roughage, but had decreasing importance as roughage quality was reduced, and vice versa for the production traits. Even so, functional traits were of higher economic importance for the Continental breed group compared to the British breed group. Small differences between the EV estimated for the RB and MC situations were observed. A sensitivity analysis for roughage price showed increased importance of production traits following an increased roughage price. Substitution of subsidies with settling prices that covers production costs in the profit equation led to increased importance of carcass weight, age at first calving and calcing interval while the importance of herd life of cow was reduced. Overall, the results suggest that changed external productions conditions have minor to moderate effects on future breeding objectives for beef cattle. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the epididymis sample storage conditions and season on the sperm morphological characteristics of wild boars (Sus scrofa L.). The samples were collected from males hunted in northern Lithuania. Straight after shooting the animal and cutting out the both testis, the epididymis was dissected and divided into three parts. One part was placed on a freezing element (4±2°C), the second one into a 3.0 % sodium citrate and the third one into a preservative solution. For determination of seasonal effects, the samples were placed only into a preservative solution. In the laboratory, all the epididymis were broken up and flushed spermatozoa were dyed with eosin. Morphological characteristics of sperm were evaluated by the accepted methodology. Sample storage conditions in 20-24 hours period had no effect on the sperm morphological characteristics of wild boar males (n=6). The study of the seasonal effects on the sperm morphological properties of European wild boar indicated that during the breeding season (November and December) the number of intact spermatozoa in the semen of second year males (n=5) and 3 year or older males (n=6) was similar and accounted for 54.0 and 52.0 % respectively. During the off-season (May and June), the average number of intact spermatozoa in the semen of second year males (n=5) and 3 year or older males (n=6) was respectively 16.2 and 13.0 % or by 37.8 and 39.0 % lower (P<0.001) than that in the semen of contemporary wild boar males hunted at the time of oestrus. In the summer time, the second-year wild boar males can inseminate the second year gilts in heat of the same group what leads to degeneration due to close inbreeding. Older wild boar males should be preserved in order to preserve the reproductive traits of wild boar groups and their genetic values. The seasonal changes of the sexual cycle might have been influenced by global warming and good nutrition conditions throughout the year.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal brain tumor in adults. Its invasive nature currently represents the most challenging hurdle to surgical resection. The mechanism adopted by GBM cells to carry out their invasive strategy is an intricate program that recalls what takes place in embryonic cells during development and in carcinoma cells during metastasis formation, the so-called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. GBM cells undergo a series of molecular and conformational changes shifting the tumor toward mesenchymal traits, including extracellular matrix remodeling, cytoskeletal re-patterning, and stem-like trait acquisition. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the whole infiltrative process represents the first step toward successful treatment of this pathology. Here, we review recent findings demonstrating the invasive nature of GBM cancer stem cells, together with novel candidate molecules associated with both cancer stem cell biology and GBM invasion, like doublecortin and microRNAs. These findings may affect the design of effective therapies currently not considered for GBM invasive progression. © 2013 BioMed Central Ltd.},

Cowpea grains rich in protein are consumed in different forms in several parts of the tropics. The average grain yield of cowpea in West Africa is approximately 492. kg/ha, which is much lower than its potential yields. This low productivity is due to a host of diseases, insects, pests, parasitic weeds, drought, poor soils and low plant population density in farmers' fields. Ex situ collection of over 15,000 accessions of cowpea and wild Vigna germplasm from different parts of the world were assembled in the IITA gene bank. These genetic resources have been explored to identify new traits and to develop elite cowpea varieties. Many cowpea varieties with high yield potential have been developed and adopted by the farmers. Efforts are continuing to develop better performing varieties using conventional breeding procedures, while molecular tools are being developed to facilitate progress in cowpea breeding. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This study sought to establish the burden, antibiogram and pathogenicity of bacteria in 4 selected waste dumpsites and those found on hands and clothings of the respective waste dumpsite workers in Benin City. Swabs from hands and clothings of waste site workers and specimens of top soils and leacheates from waste dumpsites were obtained at monthly intervals for 12 months from 4 sites in Benin City (University of Benin, Costain Road, Government Reservation Area, and Benin Bye-pass). The samples were cultured on Blood, MacConkey and Griseofulvin nutrient agar plates and incubated aerobically and anaerobically. Heterotrophic viable bacteria counts were determined for soil and leacheate specimens. The predominant bacterial isolates from the cultured plates were phenotypically characterized using standard methods. Antimicrobial disc susceptibility tests and pathogenicity tests were also carried out on the predominant isolates. Eleven Bacteria Genera were isolated from topsoils and leacheates. They were in the following order of predominance: Bacillus sp (18.20%) Staphylococcus sp (13.93%), Escherichia coli (12.72%), Proteus sp (12.12%), Streptococcus sp (12.12%), Klebsiella sp (9.70%), Pseudomonas sp (7.90%), Citrobacter sp (5.45%), Bacteroides sp (3.03%), Clostridium sp (2.42%), Serratia sp (2.42%). Bacterial isolates from the waste workers were essentially similar to those isolated from the dumpsites although the latter were more heavily colonized. The highest bacterial burden was recorded from the top soil samples at Benin Bye-pass dumpsite with a mean viable count of 2.0×106+ 0.88×106cfu/gm while the least was from the University of Benin dumpsite with mean count of 0.7×106+0.56×106cfu/gm.The antibiograms of the isolates revealed that the organisms were most susceptible to the fluroquinolones especially Ciprofloxacin (96.6%) and Pefloxacin (94.6%). They were least susceptible to Amoxacillin (51.7%) and Erythromycin (55.8%). All bacteria species isolated showed multiple drug resistance patterns with Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa each exhibiting higher levels of multidrug resistance. A number of the isolates exhibited pathogenicity traits. Whereas 27.6% of them were positive for virulence gene, 24.3% were invasive while 17.2% were diarrheagenic. We conclude that municipal waste dumpsites and those working at such sites bear heavy burdens of potentially pathogenic multidrug resistant bacteria which may constitute major public health hazards, not only to the immediate communities but also to the families of such site workers. The need to educate these waste workers on the use of appropriate protective materials and about the risks and hazards associated with their job are emphasized. Proper disposal and recycling of these wastes ought to be mandatory. © CMS UNIBEN JMBR.},

	abstract = {Heterosis describes the phenomenon in which hybrids formed between individuals of the same or closely related species are more robust or vigorous than their parents. Thus, the terms heterosis and hybrid vigor are often used interchangeably. There are two broad classes of hypotheses for the mechanisms underlying heterosis: dominance and overdominance. Under the dominance hypothesis, detrimental recessive alleles accumulate in the homozygous state during inbreeding and cause a reduction in vigor, or inbreeding depression. When inbred individuals are mated, their offspring become heterozygous at these loci and the detrimental alleles are covered by dominant alleles, thus relieving inbreeding depression and restoring vigor. Under the overdominance hypothesis, the products of heterozygous loci are more robust than those of either homozygous locus. Thus, increased homozygosity reduces vigor, and heterozygosity introduced by outbreeding leads to enhanced robustness. These two hypotheses make similar predictions at the level of genetics, but may be distinguished by combined molecular and genetic analysis. They are not mutually exclusive; both mechanisms may be active and important in heterosis in different organisms under different conditions. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Vasculogenic mimicry is a highly patterned vascular channel distinguished from the endothelium-dependent blood vessel. Vasculogenic mimicry is lined by highly aggressive tumor cells, and is associated with tumor grade, invasion and metastasis, and poor clinical prognosis. Much attention has been focused on the signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment needed for vasculogenic mimicry formation, however, the studies on the spacial foundation for vasculogenic mimicry formation are limited. There are many lipid droplets in hepatocellular carcinoma due to steatosis, while increased numbers of lipid droplets also have been reported in many other neoplastic processes. The role of lipid droplets in tumor is still unclear. Based on the similar structural and morphological characteristics between vasculogenic mimicry and lipid droplet, we speculate that the lipid droplets may lay a spacial foundation for vasculogenic mimicry formation by a way of "space placeholder" in HCC. Experimental data and limited clinical literatures support the hypothesis to a certain degree. This hypothesis may provide a new idea for the study of vasculogenic mimicry and also provide a new direction for the functional study of lipid droplets in tumor. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This review provides an overview for the non-specialist of the strategies to breed for disease resistance, with equal weighting on traditional phenotypic methods and the changes being introduced by modern genomic tests. It starts by explaining four key concepts in selective breeding: heritability, estimated breeding value (EBV), repeatability and genetic correlation. It then explains the decisions required to create selection objectives, selection criteria and selection indices. The response to selection is then considered with emphasis on the factors that constrain the response to selection: generation interval, variation in breeding values, selection intensity, effective population size and the accuracy of selection. Quantitative genetic theory can accurately predict the response to selective breeding of production traits, but is less effective at predicting the response to selection for resistance to microbial and parasitic diseases because selecting resistant animals and culling susceptible animals can alter the rate of disease transmission. Mathematical models are therefore required to predict the effect of genetic and epidemiological changes on disease incidence. © CAB International 2012.},

There is increasing concern among consumers about welfare of these animals, and that the poor welfare an animal suffers in the course of its life may have a negative influence on the quality of the meat deriving from this animal. Housing systems can have a high influence on animal welfare but there is little evidence that meat quality is impaired under usual management conditions. Transport stress can cause poor carcass quality, too low pH values and possibly PSE (pigs, turkey) or DFD meat (cattle) when the animals are transported for too long or under inappropriate conditions. Stunning and slaughter seem to have the highest impact on both animal welfare and meat quality. In order to protect the animals and meat quality, a critical review of all common housing systems, allowed transport and currently applied stunning methods should be carried out. 'Animal-friendliness' should become an additional and important quality trait for meat. This will meet consumer demands and will influence their purchasing decision. It is therefore necessary to further promote labelling systems, which give the consumer the choice between different product lines. Successful meat production in future has to be based on transparency of the food chain, displaying the safety of the product and the health and the welfare of the animals that provide the meat. © 2009 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

Two isolates that had been shown to cause disease and mortality in experimentally infected rainbow trout were compared with five avirulent isolates. Both virulent isolates showed high adhesion to gill and intestinal mucus of rainbow trout, whereas the majority of non-virulent strains demonstrated significantly lower adhesion. A decrease in adherence capability following bacterial treatment with sodium metaperiodate and proteolytic enzymes suggested the involvement of carbohydrates and proteins. All strains were able to adhere to and invade chinook salmon embryo cell line (CHSE-214), fathead minnow epithelial cell line (FHM) and rainbow trout liver cell line (R1). One non-virulent strain was highly adhesive and invasive in the three cell lines, whereas the virulent strains showed moderate adhesive and invasive capacity. The internalization of several isolates was inhibited by colchicine and cytochalasin-D, suggesting that microtubules and microfilaments play a role. For all strains, intracellular survival assays showed a decrease of viable bacteria in the cells 6 h after inoculation, suggesting that Y. ruckeri is not able to multiply or survive inside cultured cells. Analysis of the susceptibility to the bactericidal effect of rainbow trout serum demonstrated that virulent Y. ruckeri strains were serum resistant, whereas non-virulent strains were generally serum sensitive. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Matsumoto Eosinophilia Shinshu (MES) rat strain develops hereditary blood eosinophilia due to the mutant Cybames gene. In contrast, BN.MES-Cybames congenic rats, in which the mutant Cybames gene introduced into the background of the BN strain, have a normal blood eosinophil level despite showing robust proliferation of eosinophils in the bone marrow. However, the congenic rats manifest focal necrosis with eosinophilic infiltration in the liver, a phenotype rarely observed in the original MES rat strain. To elucidate the genetic basis for the strain differences, (MES × BN.MES-Cybames)F2 rats were bred, and genetic analyses of phenotypes for eosinophilia were performed. Blood and bone marrow eosinophil levels in the F2 rats showed broad distributions, suggesting that the traits were under the influence of multiple genes. Genetic association studies revealed that BN-derived marker loci on chromosomes 9 and 5 were responsible for the increase in eosinophil level in the bone marrow, decrease in blood eosinophil level, and the induction of focal necrosis with eosinophilic infiltration in the liver. The BN-derived allele of the marker gene on chromosome 1 was responsible for the decrease of both bone marrow and blood eosinophil levels. These data suggest the existence of genes characterizing/distinguishing the eosinophilic phenotypes of MES and BN.MES-Cybames on these chromosomes, and form the basis for positional cloning studies of the genes. These studies will advance the understanding of the mechanisms involved in eosinophil mobilization from the bone marrow and recruitment to the organs.},

	abstract = {Prosopis (Mesquite) trees are members of the Fabaceae family. They are the 'backbone' plants of many xeriscape environments including the Thar Desert because of their ability to fix nitrogen and tolerate aridity. Leguminous tree products are economically important sources of food, fodder, firewood, timber and soil fertility enrichment. Improvement in quality attributes through selection, modification and mass production of germplasm is desirable. Sexual and asexual methods have been developed and used for multiplication of P. cineraria and P. juliflora. Propagation through seeds is the most common practice for raising quality trait seedlings for new plantations in arid areas. Vegetative methods for propagation, such as cuttings, suckers, air layering and tissue cultures are available but more efforts towards their refinement are still required, particularly with regards nursery and laboratory techniques, before commercial cultivation. Multiplication of germplasm through plant tissue culture methods is one of the applications of biotechnology via which elite trees can be mass produced rapidly. Various problems are encountered with tissue culture of P. cineraria and P. juliflora therefore this technique is still at the laboratory stage and requires more research effort. Thus, macro propagation must be utilised for genetic improvement and large-scale production of desired plants. This chapter also describes aspects of the eco-biology and economic importance with regard to the development of arid and semi-arid regions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

	abstract = {Background: In Gram-negative bacteria, the most commonly studied quorum sensing signals are the N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). In Salmonella, AHLs are recognized by SdiA, which is believed to be a sensor of AHLs produced by other bacteria, since Salmonella does not produce AHLs itself. It has been speculated that AHLs produced by the gastrointestinal flora may influence the regulation of virulence traits in Salmonella. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of AHLs on epithelial cell invasion by Salmonella in vitro.Methods: Invasion by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) strain and its isogenc sdiA mutant was studied using a conventional gentamycin invasion assay with HEp-2 cells at 37°C. Gene expression was studied using a semi-quantitative PCR.Results: The S. Typhimurium strain, but not its isogenic sdiA mutant, displayed increased in vitro invasion after addition of both N-hexanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone (C6-AHL) and N-octanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone (C8-AHL). Increased expression of two of the genes in the SdiA regulon (rck and srgE) was observed in the wild type strain, but not in the sdiA mutant.Conclusions: The results from the present study show that S. Typhimurium can respond to two different AHL quorum sensing signals (C6-AHL and C8-AHL) with increased cell invasion at 37°C in vitro, and that this response most likely is sdiA mediated. These results indicate that if AHLs are present in the intestinal environment, they may increase the invasiveness of Salmonella. © 2011 Nesse et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {An estimated 2.67 million metric tonnes of farmed shrimp were produced in 2005 with an estimated value greater than US$10.6 billion. Despite the economic importance of farmed shrimp, the global shrimp farming industry has been slow to adopt approaches to genetic improvement which are prevalent in more mature meat-producing industries. In the early 1990s, a number of research and commercial shrimp breeding programs emerged, and these programs generated basic information about the quantitative genetics of shrimp. Researchers quantified heritability estimates for commercially important traits, and generated information about phenotypic and genetic variation, phenotypic and genetic correlations, and genotype × environment interactions. Importantly, these programs provided evidence that selective breeding of shrimp can be effective in improving traits of commercial importance, such as growth and disease resistance. Currently, there are shrimp breeding programs in the Americas, Asia, Australia, New Caledonia, Madagascar, and the Middle East.Although selective breeding offers tremendous opportunity for increased production and profitability to the shrimp farmer by improving commercially important traits, there are significant obstacles to the large-scale adoption of genetic improvement strategies. The value of selectively bred shrimp cannot be fully realized if shrimp are grown in environments where virulent pathogens exist. It is important for farmers using genetically improved shrimp to adopt cost-effective, biosecure strategies to mitigate the risk of pathogen introduction into their grow-out ponds so that the genetic potential of their crop can be fully realized. In addition, care must be taken to ensure that founder stocks for shrimp breeding programs come from genetically diverse populations. If not, problems associated with inbreeding depression may arise, resulting in reduced production and profitability. The sustainability of the global shrimp farming industry will be predicated on the use of selectively bred, genetically diverse populations of specific pathogen- free shrimp stocked in biosecure environments. © 2009 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

Studied genotypes belong to different maturity groups FAO 400 (ZP 434, NS 444 ultra), FAO 600 (ZP 684, NS 6010) and FAO 700 (ZP 735, Dunav). The field experiments were carried out in dry land farming in the region of Southwest Vojvodina province (Serbia), during the years 2006 and 2007. Genotype had significant effect on the Dry Matter Yield (DMY), Grain Yield (GY), Grain Starch Content (GSC), Grain Protein Content (GPC), Starch Yield (SY) and Protein Yield (PY). The genotype NS 6010 among the 6 genotypes had the highest DMY (24.0 ton ha-1), GY (12695 kg ha-1), SY (8951.8 kg ha-1) andPY (1225.9 kg hawe-1). Genotype NS 444 ultra statistically had the lowest DMY (17.8 ton ha-1), GPC (9.29%) and PY (925.0 kg ha-1). Also, the year have a significant effect on the all studied traits. Two years differed significantly in distribution of precipitation. In 2006, averages for genotypes, DMY, GY, GSC, GPC, SY and P Y were significantly higher then in 2007 because of higher amount and distribution of precipitation, especially during the summer months of June to August. The GPC decreased with increasing GSC and GY. © Medwell Journals, 2011.},

Methods: The recombinant vector (pSIREN-VEGF-C) was transfected into the human breast cancer cell MCF-7 by liposome and the positive transfected cell clones were screened with puromycin. Expression of VEGF-C in MCF-7 cells after gene transfer was detected by real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot assay, respectively. Proliferation and invasion ability of transfected cells were analyzed by MTT and Transwell filter. Results: The expressions of VEGF-C mRNA and protein were decreased markedly compared with the control group after the transfection and the inhibitive ratio was 95% and 100% respectively (P < 0.05). The proliferation of MCF-7 cells transfected by pSIREN-VEGF-C, measured with MTT assays, was significantly decended (P < 0.05). The invasion ability of passing through the Transwell filter of MCF-7 cells transfected by pSIREN-VEGF-C were declined evidently (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The recombinant vector (pSIREN-VEGF-C) have been proved not only to be effective and specific for down-regulation of VEGF-C, but also can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of MCF-7 cells significantly.},

	abstract = {A profile of Roger Chetelat, the director of the C.M. Rick Tomato Genetics Resource Center at the University of California, Davis. Chetelat maintains one of the largest collections of tomato seeds in the world. Many of those seeds come from wild tomato species that Chetelat and his associates collect on field research trips to the dry coastal areas of Chile, Peru, and Ecuador. Wild tomatoes are tough, versatile organisms that have evolved resistance to virtually all common tomato diseases and pests and stubbornly tolerate extreme environmental conditions. Some boast extraordinarily high levels of sugars, beta carotene, vitamin C, lycopene, and antioxidants. Chetelat has dedicated his career to finding and preserving these genetic riches. Modern cultivated tomatoes are a frail, inbred lot. They all trace their origins to a single, wild tomato plant that underwent a random mutation sometime in prehistory. Because of this genetic fluke, that plant's fruits were plump, juicy, and many, many times larger than the output of its progenitors. Offspring from that tomato were taken away from the Andes and domesticated in what is present-day Mexico, becoming severed from their wild ancestors and the vast pool of genetic diversity that tomatoes had evolved over the millennia. Botanists call this a " bottleneck." It leaves subsequent generations susceptible to disease and unable to adjust to rapid climate changes. The stored wild seeds at the Rick Center enable plant breeders to re-incorporate desirable wild traits into new tomato varieties, literally reconnecting them to their ancestral roots, ensuring that this vast reservoir of genetic diversity will be available when it is needed.},

Since then, afforestation with exotic trees has been used to stabilize the mobile dunes. Weinvestigated the effect of exotic afforestation on dune vegetation and bird diversity.Weconducted pair-wise plant and bird inventories in both afforested and undisturbed dunes in the province of Buenos Aires.Werecorded plant and bird richness as well as plant cover, and also computed similarity index values for both plant and bird assemblages. As the structure of the vegetation in dunes changed from an open to a relatively closed canopy, the quality of the natural vegetation deteriorated so that the most vulnerable species disappeared. Afforested sites showed a clear decline in the shade-intolerant species that are characteristic of dunes, and of native species, indicating moist environmental conditions as well. Grassy dunes were significantly richer in bird species than wooded dunes. Grassland and rural birds, predominantly insectivores, were mostly abundant in them. In the forest, the bird community was dominated by granivores and species characteristic of urban areas. The afforested sites contained fewer plant species of wet or damp conditions, indicating that they are drier than the open grasslands. The functional plant groups 'dune obligate' and 'moist soils' and the bird groups 'insectivore' and 'granivore' were found to be good predictors of habitat changes resulting from afforestation, so much so that they can be used as bioindicators. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The reciprocal intergeneric hybrids between common wheat and Roegneria kamoji were successfully obtained by means of embryo culture. Morphology, chromosome pairing behavior at meiosis, fertility, and resistance to scab of the hybrid F1 and BC1 were studied. The results showed that the morphology of the reciprocal intergeneric hybrids F1 between R. kamoji and T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring were intermediate type between the two parental species. The chromosome configuration at metaphase I (MI) of pollen mother cell (PMC) in reciprocal F1 was 40.33I + 0.78II + 0.03III and 40.40I + 0.79II, respectively. All of the F1 plants showed complete male sterility, and the seeds of BC1 were obtained by backcrossing with Chinese Spring pollen. The somatic chromosome numbers in BC1 plants of (R. kamoji x Chinese Spring) F1 x Chinese Spring ranged from 55 to 63. Many univalents were observed at MI of PMC, which resulted in the sterility of BC1 plants. Similarly, the chromosome numbers in BC1 plants of (Chinese Spring xR. kamoji) F1 x Chinese Spring also ranged from 55 to 63; however, many bivalents at MI of PMC and fertile pollen were observed resulting in partial fruitfulness in some BC1 plants by self-crossing. A plant (2n=63) with 42 wheat chromosomes and 21 R. kamoji chromosomes was obtained from R. kamoji x Chinese Spring cross, which had a chromosome configuration at MI of 26.40I + 18.30II. Because many univalents existed, this plant showed complete male sterility, and BC1 plants were obtained by back-crossing with Chinese Spring as the pollen parent. The chromosome numbers of BC1 ranged from 40 to 59, which contained less alien chromosomes. Although the morphology of the spike in BC1 plants was similar to that of Chinese Spring, these BC1 plants were still sterile. All F1 and most of the BC1 plants showed high resistance to Fusarium graminearum, which indicated that the resistance to scab from R. kmoji can be transferred into wheat.Microsatellite markers were used to make marker regression analysis on activity of lactate dehydrogenase based on double pseudo-testcross strategy using Windows Map Manager2.0 software. The parents that came from the cross between progenies of Hebao-cold tolerance red carp and Barbless carp and F2 progenies were used as segregating populations. For maker regression, a total of 12 markers associated with activity of lactate dehydrogenase were significant at P<0.05 and HLJE222 was significant at P<0.01. The variance explained by these loci, ranged from 4.00% to 10.00%. Locus HLJE222 was closely linked to the gene related to activity of lactate dehydrogenase of common carp. For further identification, EST-SSR markers were used to screen the protein and nucleotide database using bioinformatics tools in order to find the homologies. High sequence similarities of HLJE222 marker were observed with the nucleotide sequence of DAZ associated protein 1mRNA of zebrafish(94%), and protein sequence of DAZ associated protein 1(97%). DAZ protein is one of the short chain dehydrogenases, which is an important enzyme in the process of glucose metabolism in the organisms. This family contains a wide variety of dehydrogenases. This indicates that locus HLJE222 was closely linked to the gene associated with activity of lactate dehydrogenase of common carp.},

	abstract = {In farm animal breeding, behavioural traits are rarely included in selection programmes despite their potential to improve animal production and welfare. Breeding goals have been broadened beyond production traits in most farm animal species to include health and functional traits, and opportunities exist to increase the inclusion of behaviour in breeding indices. On a technical level, breeding for behaviour presents a number of particular challenges compared to physical traits. It is much more difficult and time-consuming to directly measure behaviour in a consistent and reliable manner in order to evaluate the large numbers of animals necessary for a breeding programme. For this reason, the development and validation of proxy measures of key behavioural traits is often required. Despite these difficulties, behavioural traits have been introduced by certain breeders. For example, ease of handling is now included in some beef cattle breeding programmes. While breeding for behaviour is potentially beneficial, ethical concerns have been raised. Since animals are adapted to the environment rather than the other way around, there may be a loss of 'naturalness' and/or animal integrity. Some examples, such as breeding for good maternal behaviour, could enhance welfare, production and naturalness, although dilemmas emerge where improved welfare could result from breeding away from natural behaviour. Selection against certain behaviours may carry a risk of creating animals which are generally unreactive ('zombies'), although such broad effects could be measured and controlled. Finally, breeding against behavioural measures of welfare could inadvertently result in resilient animals ('stoics') that do not show behavioural signs of low welfare yet may still be suffering. To prevent this, other measures of the underlying problem should be used, although cases where this is not possible remain troubling. © 2010 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare The Old School.},

The principal events that lead to invasive aspergillosis take place in the alveolus, where inhaled conidia germinate into invading hyphae that penetrate the respiratory epithelium. Pulmonary innate immunity against Aspergillus infection consists of resident and recruited phagocytes, soluble immune factors, and antimicrobial proteins. Various Aspergillus traits, including the production of pigment, antioxidants, proteases, adhesins, siderophores, and mycotoxins, are implicated as potential virulence factors. The complex interplay amongst these factors, usually in the setting of depressed immunity, forms the basis for this medically important opportunistic mycosis. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

	abstract = {Carassius gibelio (Bloch) is documented to have been moved from Asia across Europe in the 17th century since which time it has been reported to exist in fresh water across Europe. The first time this species was reported in Turkey was in 1988 and it has since been reported in fresh water occurring in various sites in Turkey. C. gibelio is an intrusive species that has a negative impact upon natural species occurring in the fresh water sites that it invades. It is known to end up achieving dominance in fresh water sites by not only increasing their total biomass through rapid growth but also competing with the indigenous species. The chief reason for the rapid invasion of this species is thought to be its gynogenetic reproductive ability. Various studies have demonstrated that this species makes up colonies with different genetic traits within the same medium of fresh water as a result of gynogenetic reproduction. A large number of colonies that are reproduced gynogenetically are made up of female individuals. Gynogenetic reproduction is determined upon either the number of chromosomes or the size of erythrocytes. The present study was carried out in seven samples made out of 381 individuals of C. gibelio (20 males and 361 females) cultivated from the dam on the Porsuk river between May and December 2009. About 95% of the population was made up of female individuals. Blood samples were taken off 4 female individuals in December and then preparations of blood smear were arranged. Afterwards, the area and volume of the erythrocyte cell of 50 individuals as well as nuclear area and volume of erythrocyte cells were calculated. These analyses showed the range of erythrocytes of the 4 individuals were 51.31, 58.70, 57.44 and 47.44 μm2, respectively. Their range of erythrocyte nucleus were 8.50, 12.41, 8.54 and 7.26 μm2, respectively. The volumes of erythrocyte cells were 221, 304, 271 and 195.6 μm3, respectively while the volumes of erythrocyte nucleus were 14.66, 30.64, 16.24 and 11.72 μm3, respectively. A comparison of nuclear area of the second individual which had the largest nucleus area with those of the remaining 3 individuals determined their areas to be 1.46, 1.45 and 1.71. Previous studies have revealed that nuclear area of erythrocytes of the individuals with triploid (3n) have a much bigger nucleus than individuals with diploid (2n). The population structure consisting of 95% females and the size difference between the erythrocyte nucleus areas displays the gynogenetic reproduction potential of C. gibelio population in Porsuk Dam lake. © Medwell Journals, 2010.},

	abstract = {Many organisms have complex life cycles with distinct life stages that experience different environmental conditions.How does the complexity of life cycles affect the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to climate change? We address this question by exploring several recent case studies and synthetic analyses of insects. First, different life stages may inhabit different microhabitats, and may differ in their thermal sensitivities and other traits that are important for responses to climate. For example, the life stages of Manduca experience different patterns of thermal and hydric variability, and differ in tolerance to high temperatures. Second, life stages may differ in their mechanisms for adaptation to local climatic conditions. For example, in Colias, larvae in different geographic populations and species adapt to local climate via differences in optimal and maximal temperatures for feeding and growth, whereas adults adapt via differences in melanin of the wings and in other morphological traits. Third, we extend a recent analysis of the temperature-dependence of insect population growth to demonstrate how changes in temperature can differently impact juvenile survival and adult reproduction. In both temperate and tropical regions, high rates of adult reproduction in a given environment may not be realized if occasional, high temperatures prevent survival to maturity. This suggests that considering the differing responses of multiple life stages is essential to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change. © The Author 2011.

	abstract = {Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony type (MmmSC) has been eradicated in the developed world, but it is still present in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa. After initially successful control measures in the 1960s it has been spreading due to a lack of money, fragmentation of veterinary services, uncontrolled cattle movement, insufficient vaccine efficacy and sensitivity of current diagnostic tests. In this study we used two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot with sera from MmmSC-infected animals and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry to identify novel immunogenic proteins as candidate molecules for improved diagnostics and vaccines. We identified 24 immunogens recognized by pooled sera from experimentally infected cattle. Furthermore, a serum from an animal with acute clinical disease as well as severe pathomorphological lesions recognized 13 additional immunogens indicating variation in the antibody responses to CBPP amongst cattle. Most immunogens showed compelling similarity to protein/gene sequences in the two ruminant pathogens M. capricolum subsp. capricolum and M. mycoides subsp. mycoides large colony type both belonging to the mycoides cluster. Three of these proteins, namely glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase, adenylosuccinate synthase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, had no compelling homologue in the other distantly related bovine pathogen M. agalactiae. In addition, translation elongation factor Tu, heat shock protein 70, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which have been found to mediate adhesion to host tissue in other mycoplasmas were shown to be expressed and recognized by sera. These proteins have potential for the development of improved diagnostic tests and possibly vaccines. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The data included records from 2 902 718 lactations, collected in organic (n = 471) and conventional (n = 13 976) herds between 1998 and 2005. Compared with conventional herds, the organic herds were larger and increased more rapidly in size. The replacement rate was slightly lower in organic herds and fewer Swedish Holsteins were used. The statistical analysis of cow performance in the first three lactations showed lower milk, fat and protein production in organic herds, but the increase in production from first to second lactation was larger when expressed in kg milk. Fertility was better for organically managed cows compared to conventionally managed cows, but the somatic cell count (SCC) was higher. However, at a given production level the fertility was slightly worse in organic herds while there was no difference in SCC. No interactions of importance were found between production system and breed for any trait. The results showed that organic and conventional dairy production differed regarding herd structure and cow performance. However, the differences in fertility and SCC found were to a high extent explained by the lower milk yield in organic production and no breed was found to perform better in either system. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Cortisol (or corticosterone) released by the adrenal cortices exerts a large range of effects on themetabolisms, the immune system, inflammatory processes, and brain function, for example. Large individual variations have been described in HPA axis activity, with important physiopathological consequences. In terms of animal production, higher cortisol levels have negative effects on growth rate and feed efficiency and increases the fat/lean ratio of carcasses. On the contrary, cortisol has positive effects on traits related to robustness and adaptation, such as newborn survival or tolerance to heat stress. Intense selection for lean tissue during the last decades has reduced concomitantly the activity of the corticotropic axis, with negative consequences of selection on piglet survival for instance. One strategy to improve robustness is to select animalswith higher HPA axis activity. Research on themolecularmechanisms of this variability is very active. The objective is to identifymarkers that could be used to select animalswith higher HPA axis activity, and thus improve their robustnesswithout damaging their production potential, which is the primary selection objective in the development of "sustainable" farming.},

	abstract = {There are over 2000 Salmonella bacterial species, many of which have very wide host-species ranges. Infection with Salmonella in chickens generally progresses through three distinct phases: first, invasion via the gastrointestinal tract; second, establishment of a systemic infection in internal organs; and third, one of three distinct outcomes in the final phase. In the final phase, Salmonella infections in chickens may be completely resolved by effective immune mechanisms, or may cause acute and severe pathology, even death, or may result in an asymptomatic and chronic carrier state. Carrier birds can shed bacteria into eggs and into the environment, causing vertical and horizontal transfer of bacteria, and may serve as a source of microbial contamination of poultry meat and eggs. Thus, in addition to negatively impacting chicken health, Salmonella contamination of poultry products represents a threat to human health. With strong consumer preferences and, in some countries, legislation limiting the use of antimicrobial drugs in poultry production, enhancing genetic resistance to Salmonella is an attractive component of a comprehensive programme to control disease in poultry. The chicken's response to Salmonella is complex, with many cellular components, including early-responding macrophages and heterophils, and utilizes innate immune mechanisms, Th1 cytokine production and protective cellular and humoral immune responses. There is strong evidence for genetic control of many facets of host response to Salmonella infection. As reviewed in this chapter, distinct lines of chickens have been characterized with different responses to Salmonella, several specific genes have been demonstrated to have structural or expression variation associated with salmonellosis or Salmonella carrier state, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Salmonella response have been identified by genomic scans and transcriptional analyses have elucidated key genes and pathways that are altered in response to infection with Salmonella. Therefore, although there is much remaining to be discovered, a foundation of knowledge already exists about the genetic control of resistance to Salmonella in chickens that will enable the use of genetic approaches to enhance bird health and reduce microbial contamination of poultry products. © CAB International 2011.},

	abstract = {Fusion genes are chimeric genes formed in cancers through genomic aberrations such as translocations, amplifications, and rearrangements. To identify fusion genes in gastric cancer, we analyzed regions of chromosomal imbalance in a cohort of 106 primary gastric cancers and 27 cell lines derived from gastric cancers. Multiple samples exhibited genomic breakpoints in the 5′ region of SLC1A2/EAAT2, a gene encoding a glutamate transporter. Analysis of a breakpoint-positive SNU16 cell line revealed expression of a CD44-SLC1A2 fusion transcript caused by a paracentric chromosomal inversion, which was predicted to produce a truncated but functional SLC1A2 protein. In primary tumors, CD44-SLC1A2 gene fusions were detected in 1 to 2% of gastric cancers, but not in adjacent matched normal gastric tissues. When we specifically silenced CD44-SLC1A2, cellular proliferation, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth were significantly reduced. Conversely, CD44-SLC1A2 overexpression in gastric cells stimulated these pro-oncogenic traits. CD44-SLC1A2 silencing caused significant reductions in intracellular glutamate concentrations and sensitized SNU16 cells to cisplatin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in gastric cancer. We conclude that fusion of the SLC1A2 gene coding region to CD44 regulatory elements likely causes SLC1A2 transcriptional dysregulation, because tumors expressing high SLC1A2 levels also tended to be CD44-SLC1A2-positive. CD44-SLC1A2 may represent a class of gene fusions in cancers that establish a pro-oncogenic metabolic milieu favoring tumor growth and survival.},

	abstract = {Footrot of sheep is an infectious disease resulting from invasion of epidermal tissue of the hoof by a mixed group of bacteria, particularly Dichelobacter nodosus, a Gramnegative anaerobic bacterium. The disease may progress to separation of the sole, soft and hard horn from the underlying hoof matrix. In severe cases, footrot is a debilitating disease associated with acute lameness, it impacts on animal welfare and it causes substantial economic losses. Footrot has been reported in almost all sheep-raising countries around the world. Under field conditions, footrot severity may be conveniently scored on a scale where 0 indicates normal feet, 1 is limited interdigital dermatitis or scald, and 2-4 indicate increasing severity of footrot. Resistance, assessed either on single or repeated scores, or on presence or absence of footrot, has been shown to be a heritable trait in a variety of breeds under contrasting environmental conditions, and for both deliberate and natural challenge. Such heritabilities are generally close to 0.20, with the heritability of liability to footrot being slightly higher. Further, significant additive genetic variation has been demonstrated in Merino sheep for response to D. nodosus vaccines. Genetic markers for resistance would be beneficial; however, strong and consistent associations would be required to justify their application in the field. Currently there is sufficient preliminary information available on relevant genetic parameters for footrot resistance, as well as its correlations with other production traits, to include resistance to footrot in sheep-breeding programmes. However, it is not sensible to consider selection for footrot resistance without also considering non-genetic disease control. An overall programme to improve animal health and performance will need to consider all economically feasible forms of disease control, along with optimized selection strategies. © CAB International 2011.},

	abstract = {The first breeding value for udder health of a bull is based on the performance of his daughters in their first lactation. However, clinical mastitis (CM) is not a problem in first lactation only. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for CM and somatic cell count (SCC) for the first three lactations of Dutch Holstein cattle. Data from 250 Dutch herds recording CM were used to quantify the genetic variation of CM in parity 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The dataset contained 35,379 lactations from 21,064 animals of different parities. Test-day SCC was available from all lactations. Somatic cell counts were log-transformed to somatic cell scores (SCS) and averaged over test-day records between 5 and 335, 5 and 150, and 151 and 335 days in milk. Variance components for CM and SCS were estimated using a sire-maternal grandsire model. The heritability for CM was approximately 3% in all parities. Genetic correlations between CM in consecutive lactations were high (0.9), but somewhat lower between parity 1 and 3 (0.6). All genetic correlations between CM and SCS were positive, implying that genetic selection on lower SCC will reduce CM-incidence. Estimated genetic correlations were stronger for SCS in the first half of lactation than in the second half of lactation. Selection indices showed that most progress could be achieved when treating CM in parity 1, 2, and 3 as different traits and by including SCS between 5 and 150 days in the udder health index. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Mosquito larval development occurs in aquatic habitats that are directly or indirectly exposed to chemical contaminants. Little is known about how interaction of these chemicals with other biotic and abiotic stressors impact mosquito populations. We used two levels of nutrient (low and high) and four larval densities (10, 20, 30, 40) to examine the effects of low concentrations of insecticide malathion, on Culex pipiens L. mosquitoes experiencing stress from larval competition. Addition of malathion at the high nutrient condition enhanced survival with increasing larval densities, but this effect was not observed at low nutrient condition. Males exposed to malathion were significantly larger than those from control treatments while the effect of malathion on size of females varied with larval density and the level of nutrients. Larval exposure to malathion and low nutrient resulted in significantly larger females with increases in larval densities compared with other treatments. The effect of malathion on male longevity varied with larval density and amount of nutrients. At higher densities, male longevity was consistently higher in low nutrient than in high nutrient conditions and addition of malathion in high nutrient treatment increased male longevity at the highest density. These effects are most likely attributable to release from competition among survivors after mortality from malathion and density-dependent effects. We conclude that biotic conditions of the larval habitat can alter the impact of low concentrations of chemical contaminants on mosquito populations in ways that may influence the pattern of disease transmission and the outcome of vector control efforts. © 2010.},

	abstract = {Brazil has various species of domestic animals, which developed from breeds brought by the Portuguese settlers soon after the discovery of the country. After being submitted to a long process of natural selection, these breeds present characteristics adapted to specific Brazilian environmental conditions, and are known as "criollo", "local" or naturalized breeds. From the beginning of the 20th century, some exotic breeds, selected in temperate regions, have begun to be imported, and, although more productive, they do not have adaptive traits, such as resistance to disease and parasites found in the naturalized breeds. Even so, they gradually replaced the native breeds, to such an extent that the latter are in danger of extinction. To avoid further loss of this important genetic material, in 1983 the National Research Center for Genetic Resources and Biotechnology (Cenargen) of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) decided to include conservation of animal genetic resources among its priorities. The conservation activities have been conducted under the Brazilian Genetic Resources Network - Renargen, and is carried out by various research centres of Embrapa, universities and State research institutions, as well as by private farmers, with a single coordinator at national level, Cenargen. The in situ conservation of cattle, horses, buffaloes, donkeys, goats, sheep and pigs is being carried out by Conservation Nuclei, located in the animal's original habitat. Ex situ conservation is centred at the Brazilian Animal Germplasm Bank (AGB), kept at Cenargen. This is responsible for the storage of semen and embryos of various breeds of domestic animals threatened with extinction. Presently the AGB has almost 60,000 doses of semen and more than 250 embryos, as well as over 7000 DNA samples. An important challenge for this program is to increase awareness within the different segments of society in terms of the importance of the conservation of animal genetic resources. The development and evolution of Renargen and its efforts to facilitate the conservation of genetic resources of livestock in Brazil are described in this paper. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Nowadays, interesting bioactive compounds have been also found in the fat of ruminants (milk and meat). Ruminant feeding systems based in grazing increase the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids (i.e., conjugated linoleic acid) in milk, which reputedly prevents against certain diseases, such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and cancer. This could later represent a comparative marketing advantage for milk produced under grazing conditions. Most Colombian dairy cows graze on kikuyu grass and/ or ryegrass, but those pastures have a high demand for nitrogen, compromising the sustainability of those systems. A search for new pastures, selected for adaptation, compatibility and productivity has started. The association between Lotus uliginosus and kikuyu has interesting potential in terms of milk quality. The presence of legumes in the pasture allows to decrease the need for nitrogen fertilizer and increases the content of beneficial compounds in milk, such as secondary metabolites that modify biohydrogenation patterns and increase the production of CLA precursors. Pasture management factors that affect milk fatty acid composition (i.e., age, species, and nitrogen fertilization) are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: Lactating dairy cow of the 21st century is considered to be sub-fertile after intensive selection for milk yield. production of the dairy cows exemplifies the progress that can be made in the application of technology and holistic dairy cow management to optimize production. The hormonal and metabolic responses, associated with homeorrhetic and homeostatic regulatory responses to partition nutrients for lactation, coupled with intensive management contribute to the reduction in fertility. The numerous postpartum reproductive and metabolic disorders are associated with sub-optimal fertility in the breeding period. Continual advancements have been made in reproductive/lactation physiology, endocrinology, nutrition, herd health and management to improve reproductive herd fertility on commercial dairies. Objective of this presentation is to focus on current technologies and experimental approaches relative to their application in unraveling certain biological windows, which will further impact our ability to enhance reproductive efficiency coupled with increased food production and well-being of both animals and humans. Review: Feeding of omega 6- and omega 3- polyunsaturated fatty acids exert pro- and anti- inflammatory effects on the innate immune system that increases subsequent reproductive performance. Chronic exposure to a GnRH-agonist induced a marked atrophy of the postpartum uterus. Colostrum contains a pleothera of growth factors (lactocrine secretions) that influence uterine developmental programming in the pig, and neonatal exposure to estrogens/progesterone in pigs or cattle alters early programming of the uterus leading to dysfunctional reproductive tract consequences in the adult. Physiological systems to optimize ovarian and uterine function have led to timed insemination fertility programs that have enhanced herd pregnancy rates. Sequencing of the bovine genome has provided an array of new technological approaches to unravel the multi-factorial control systems to support conceptus-placental development throughout gestation and avoid pregnancy failure. A bovine microarray identified genes that were differentially expressed in conceptus and endometrial tissues at day 17 post-LH surge in cyclic and pregnant cows that were lactating or nonlactating. Expression of PAG genes within the conceptus and endometrium of pregnant cows and their association with other genes determined by standard partial correlation analyses infer a possible role of PAG in pregnancy maintenance and implantation by regulation of embryo development, trophoblast cell invasion, immune regulation, and prostaglandin metabolism. The associations detected are suggestive of potential pathways for investigation in early pregnancy at day 17 involving potential direct and indirect effects of PAG 11 produced by the conceptus. Development of microarrays of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) across the bovine genome has led to Genomic Predicted Transmitting Abilities (GPTA) for various production traits including daughter pregnancy rates. More specific physiological reproductive traits have sufficient heritabilities that warrant consideration for selection. Furthermore, current technological advances are identifying candidate "fertility" genes for potential genetic selection. selection for production, health and reproductive traits will be the wave of the future as genomic and bioinformatic tools continue to be expanded and refined. Conclusion:This manuscript targets biological windows and technological advancements to improve reproductive performance of lactating dairy cows. Epidemiological analyses reveal that healthy postpartum lactating dairy cows are indeed fertile. Chronic exposure to a GnRH agonist induced postpartum uterine atrophy warranting additional research as to potential strategies to improve uterine health. Feeding of nutraceuticals such as polyunsaturated omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids improves postpartum innate immune function and subsequent reproductive performance. Lactocrine secretions in colostrum and neonatal exposure to estrogens and progesterone influence uterine developmental programming related to subsequent reproductive competence. Reproductive management programs that optimize ovarian and uterine function permit a fertile single timed insemination to first and second inseminations. The sequencing of the bovine genome has led to thoroughcharacterizations of the endometrium and conceptus transcriptones in response to key physiological periods such as pregnancy and lactation. Early expression of Pregnancy Associated Glycoprotein (PAG) genes within the conceptus and endometrium of pregnant cows and their association with other genes infer a possible role of PAG in pregnancy maintenance and implantation. The array of SNPs across the bovine genome and specific SNPs within candidate genes related to reproductive processes and fertility will enhance genetic selection for fertility along with production and health associated traits.},

The relationship between the logarithm of the live weight and the logarithm of time is adequately described by a general logistic function. The age period from 100 to 600 days of age is contained in the linear part of the logistic function. This region is of particular economic interest because it contains the yearling age and slaughter age that are important in DM-BBB breeding and management. Adding one of the body traits in the linear models that contain age and gender as fixed effects decreases the coefficient of variation. A model with withers height and shoulder width has the lowest coefficient of variation, with no further significant improvement when adding either heart girth or width of the hind quarters. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Since the introduction of GM crops, the market volume has increased considerably and in parallel so have the regulations concerning the use of these crops as food or feed. Regulating novel crops requires monitoring of exports and imports of GM crops. The reliability of detection assays is heavily influenced by sampling errors, extent of feed/food processing, matrix effects and associated DNA/protein extraction protocols. In the future, novel and stacked GM traits are expected to replace or complement those that have already been introduced into agricultural crops. Consequently, methodologies and legislative approaches will have to continue to evolve to ensure the continued integrity and safety of the feed and food system. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Woodhead Publishing Limited All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Objective: To study traits and influencing factors of coping styles in the military groups of social emergency responders for special service and provide a theoretical basis for epidemiologic intervention. Methods: A cross-sectional survey on coping styles and their influencing variables was carried out among 12 special service companies from Armed Police Forces and Fire Units of Public Security stationed in Chongqing by means of cluster sampling. Then, different coping styles were compared with general military personnel, the types and maturity degree of coping behaviors were evaluated, and major influencing variables were screened. Results: Of 396 subjects, 86.36% had field experience in handling emergencies. The population's average levels of coping styles are significantly higher than the military norm (P≤ 0.01), and the overall type of coping behaviors is mature. Although the relevance between the performance type and the number of 6 coping styles scores reaching the military masculine norm is significant (P<0.001), the Pearson contingency coefficient (c= 0.23) represents a relatively limited maturity in coping styles. In view of direction and extent effects of various influencing factors, lack of survival skills, disaccord on self and experience, self-inferiority as well as selfstereotypes are negative factors. In addition to social support, self-flexibility responsibility may be positive factors. Use of social support, disaccord on self and experience, self-confidence and knowledge about danger-avoiding take universal impacts, and other factors take single impact on a certain coping style. Conclusion: Coping styles in military groups of social emergency responders for special service are comparatively mature and stable, but there are significantly individual differences and a wide range of influencing factors. So, it is very necessary to advance maturity in coping styles through targeted interventions. © 2009 Editorial Board of Chin J Evid-based Med.},

	abstract = {Dr Lorenzo Dojmi di Delupis (1845-1927) was a descendant of a respectful aristocratic family from Vis. His father was Peter Dojmi di Delupis (1809-1886), an attorney, a moderate pro-Italian autonomist, and a mayor of Vis, and his mother was Margherita Siminati. As soon as he graduated from the Medical University of Graz in 1870, he joined the Ottoman army as a physician for a two-year journey in which he reached as far as Baghdad and Basra. He left notes about this dramatic, juvenile adventure in his diaries. In 1878, he married a Viennese girl Maria Neidl and brought her home to Vis, where he got a position of municipal doctor. He had an extraordinary diagnosing acuity, great sympathy for patients, and was always willing to help, which is why he was adored by all the people of Vis, whether they agreed with his autonomist ideas or not, and soon became "the father of Vis". He was the first to warn of leprosy in Dalmatia, when he diagnosed two cases in Vis. Beside medicine and politics, he was also a passionate botanist. He was the first to seed palms in Vis and to grow a palm nursery with his agronomist son Peter Dojmi, for the whole of Dalmatia. He also tried breeding ostriches and growing Mexican coffee. He funded a small meteorological station in Vis, and planned to open a health resort with professor Schröter from Vienna. Even though Lorenzo Dojmi di Delupis held the great Italian culture very dear, his vocation as a physician and humanist inclination never let him burn with the fervour of a political extremist. Thanks to his psychophysical stability, he overcame numerous difficulties in life and retained faith in people. All these traits evoke Prince Salina, the leading character of the renowned novel Il gattopardo (The Leopard) by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, which is why the author has so entitled this article "The Gattopardo of Vis".},

Animal welfare is therefore most likely to be improved on a commercial scale by future breeding programmes that incorporate multiple goals of different stakeholders as far as possible and give higher priority to animal welfare. These include: i) broilers with high welfare traits; ii) broiler breeders that do not need feed restriction; iii) birds that can be grown in an economically profitable way; iv) birds with low disease levels without the need for routine medication; v) chicken meat that is healthy and good for humans to eat; and (vi) broilers and breeders that thrive in systems that are environmentally sustainable. Progress towards achieving these goals is hampered currently by the assumptions that high juvenile growth rate is incompatible with good welfare and that feed restriction in adults is inevitable with fast-growing juveniles. We challenge these assumptions at both genetic and whole-animal level and argue that the conflict between good welfare and productivity can be reduced by making use of all available genetic variation from existing breeds and other sources and selecting birds in the range of environments they will encounter in commercial production.

	abstract = {This paper aims to construct a spatially-explicit model of Ixodes scapularis infection in the State of New York, USA, based on climate traits, high-resolution landscape features and patch-connectivity according to graph theory. The degree of risk for infection is calculated based on empirical data of host abundance, previous studies on host infectivity rates and tick preferences towards a given host. The outcome signifies what is called the "recruitment of infection", i.e. an index representing the abundance of infected ticks in a particular patch of vegetation. The results show that the I. scapularis recruitment of infection (IR) index is highly dependent upon a complex array of landscape fragmentation and the presence of key hosts. Neither faunal richness nor host density alone has any reasonable effect on the recruitment of infection. The experience of Lyme disease in the State of New York shows no clear relationship between the IR as calculated at the patch level and then summarized county by county and the rates of disease over the last eight years reported for these counties. However, areas characterized by low IR have consistently been associated with locations with low disease rates. Above all, the low levels of disease are related to minimal suitability due to the climate and negligible connection between patches. Social factors, mainly activities leading to an increased contact of humans with infective foci (which can be situated far from their homes), may lead to a high rates being reported from areas with high human densities rather than areas characterized by a high recruitment of infection. The spatial model developed here may be used to study the long-term changes in infective risk and tick recruitment as a result of human- induced changes in the landscape.},

	abstract = {Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were infected with Ichthyophonus sp. and held at 10 °C, 15 °C and 20 °C for 28 days to monitor mortality and disease progression. Infected fish demonstrated more rapid onset of disease, higher parasite load, more severe host tissue reaction and reduced mean-day-to-death at higher temperature. In a second experiment, Ichthyophonus-infected fish were reared at 15 °C for 16 weeks then subjected to forced swimming at 10 °C, 15 °C and 20 °C. Stamina improved significantly with increased temperature in uninfected fish; however, this was not observed for infected fish. The difference in performance between infected and uninfected fish became significant at 15 °C (P = 0.02) and highly significant at 20 °C (P = 0.005). These results have implications for changes in the ecology of fish diseases in the face of global warming and demonstrate the effects of higher temperature on the progression and severity of ichthyophoniasis as well as on swimming stamina, a critical fitness trait of salmonids. This study helps explain field observations showing the recent emergence of clinical ichthyophoniasis in Yukon River Chinook salmon later in their spawning migration when water temperatures were high, as well as the apparent failure of a substantial percentage of infected fish to successfully reach their natal spawning areas. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification drastically reduces diversity at different scales of livestock farming systems (LFS). This homogenization process leads to environmental degradation and ignores the fact that multiple performance criterions often come in conflict. Taking advantage of diversity at different scales of LFS is a new challenge to improve sustainability. The diversity is considered here on a functional viewpoint, i.e. a variety of functions played by individual production entities involved in overall performance. The objective of this study was to examine how the diversity of individual production entities shapes the relationship between different performance criterions at the upper scale. We used two types of dynamic models representing contrasting LFS: extensive grassland suckling farms and intensive dairy herds. Both models include a certain level of functional diversity with production entities corresponding to different types of management practices (grassland farm model) or different types of females (herd model). With the grassland farm model, we studied how the biodiversity/production relationship was influenced by the functional diversity of management practices. With the herd model, we explored how production/efficiency relationship was influenced by the functional diversity of females. At the farm scale, we showed that interactions between the diverse management practices shaped the relationship between ecological and productive performance from a convex to a concave trade-off. Complementary effects resulting from the diversity of management practices thus improved the trade-off. Trade-off shape also depended on the level of farm intensity and it was less costly for the extensive farms to achieve viable levels of ecological performance. Increasing the complementary effect through increased diversity in management practices is likely to improve the conciliation between productive and ecological performance. At the herd scale, we observed a win-win situation between production and efficiency. However, at the highest levels of production, there was a production/efficiency trade-off; increases in either production or efficiency corresponded to distinct functional groups of females. Managing the functional groups of females with targeted practices is likely to improve the production/efficiency trade-off. We concluded from both case studies that functional diversity plays a key role in the relationship between multiple performance criterions. The next steps on the research agenda include exploring new spatial and temporal scales and accounting for environmental variability. A better understanding of the role of functional diversity can benefit from multi-criterions and multi-scale modelling approaches. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Hystricognathi represent a monophyletic taxon within Rodentia. Since phylogenetically analyzed morphological systems are essential for revealing evolutionary processes, this study identifies evolutionary character transformations on the stem lineage of Hystricognathi as derived from the author's own work and the literature. Data so far indicate that evolutionary transformati ons in the rostral head region, the loss of tactile ability in the outer nasal skin and the mobile arrangement of the associated cartilage, were allied with a switch from om ni vorous to her bivorous and fiber-rich nutrition. Additional character trans formations in the skull assist in digesting such food. Structures associated with reproduction and placentation show a remark able proportion of derived character conditions: the chorioallantoic placenta has a ring-shaped organization and growth structure which optimizes the capacity for passive diffusion, a subplacenta occurred as a speci a lized region responsible for pla cental invasion and the in verted yolk sac facilitates substance exchange with the main placenta. Finally, precocial new borns evolved as a derived condition within Rodentia. All things considered, a mode of reproduction is indicated, which does not demand excessive additional energy intake by the mother and is in accor dance with her low energetic diet. Hystricognathi possess major character trans for mations that represent prerequisites for their successful radiation at the time when more open ecosystems and grasslands evolved during Earth history. The analysis resulted in the reconstruction of a life-near picture of the hystricognath stem species pattern with high explanatory power in terms of changes in space and time and their interdependence with biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Developing countries from the southern hemisphere have similarities in terms of climatic and agricultural conditions and cattle are the most important livestock species in these countries - which leads to many areas of similar interest and opportunities regarding beef cattle production. The increase in demand for meat in developing countries offers large market opportunities for livestock producers. If the productivity of beef farmers can be improved to commercial levels, it may have the potential to address poverty in these agriculturally based economies. Climate change is predicted to be highly dynamic and can have adverse effects on crop and livestock productivity. The cattle breed to be used and the production strategy to be followed in developing countries of the southern hemisphere will depend primarily on the environment and level of management. The availability of diverse cattle breed resources with adaptive and productive differences will allow breed types to be matched to different environments, management capabilities and markets. In the harsh and undeveloped areas or pastoralist systems, pure breeding with e.g. Sanga, Zebu or naturalized breeds may be the only production strategy that can be followed. In the more developed areas, crossbreeding with small indigenous cows may succeed in improving the output of beef cattle farming. It is believed that crossbreeding will gain importance in many developing counties in the southern hemisphere. It is therefore essential that crossbreeding studies be conducted where necessary, to supply information regarding heterosis and for the development of multi-breed genetic evaluations, breeding objectives and decision making. By describing production environments it may be possible to identify genotypes that are adapted to a specific environment. However, tools are needed to overlay geo-referenced data sets onto the different environments. Statistical science continues to support animal breeding and improvement, especially with respect to production traits. Traits linked to fertility and/or survival are still problematic and the appropriate quantitative breeding technology to properly handle these traits still needs to be developed. Gene or marker assisted selection may play an important role in selection for disease and parasite resistance or tolerance, since it is generally difficult to measure these traits directly. Strategies that utilize EBVs derived from genomic analyses (genomic EBVs), together with conventional mixed model methodology, may speed up the process of breeding animals with subsequent higher and more efficient production. The application of a landscape genetics approach offers the potential to greatly enhance the knowledge of how landscape heterogeneity influences the genetic population structure, gene flow, and adaptation. Results from these studies can be used to address questions related to species management and conservation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The increasingly serious problem of acid rain is leading to increased potassium (K) loss from soils, and in our field investigation, we found that even congenerically relative Mosla species show different tolerance to K-deficiency. A hydroponic study was conducted on the growth of two Mosla species and their morphological, physiological and stoichiometric traits in response to limited (0.35 mmol K/L), normal (3.25 mmol K/L) and excessive (6.50 mmol K/L) K concentrations. Mosla hangchowensis is an endangered plant, whereas Mosla dianthera a widespread weed. In the case of M. hangchowensis, in comparison with normal K concentration, K-limitation induced a significant reduction in net photosynthetic rate (Pn), soluble protein content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, but an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. However, leaf mass ratio (LMR) and root mass ratio (RMR) were changed little by K-limitation. In contrast, for M. dianthera, K-limitation had little effect on Pn, soluble protein content, SOD activity, and MDA concentration, but increased LMR and RMR. Critical values of N (nitrogen): K and K:P (phosphorus) ratios in the shoots indicated that limitation in acquiring K occurred under K-limited conditions for M. hangchowensis but not for M. dianthera. We found that low K content in natural habitats was a restrictive factor in the growth and distribution of M. hangchowensis, and soil K-deficiency caused by acid rain worsened the situation of M. hangchowensis, while M. dianthera could well acclimate to the increasing K-deficiency. We suggest that controlling the acid rain and applying K fertilizers may be an effective way to rescue the endangered M. hangchowensis. © Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.},

	abstract = {Delineating signaling pathways active in prostate epithelial cells will lead to a better understanding of those processes essential for prostate cancer progression, such as uncontrolled proliferation, survival as a consequence of resistance to cell death, invasion and metastasis, and for development of resistance to therapies such as androgen ablation and radiation therapy. Additionally, once mechanistic information is acquired, identified gene products can be used as determinants of high-grade tumor development leading to acquisition of prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for intervention. Our approach involves identifying gene expression pathways that regulate these essential functions, especially focusing on those genes related to proliferation and genotoxic stress response, examining interactions of transcription factors (TFs) such as androgen receptor (AR), p53, retinoblastoma (Rb), E2F, and WT1. Although many gene targets regulated by these TFs are known, there is relatively little information available about common regulatory pathways shared between these genes. Thus, we have sought evidence of overlapping target genes common between these TFs. A mechanistic understanding of how these key TFs regulate their gene targets, such as identification of essential cofactors and other cooperating or competing TFs will lead to additional therapeutic and diagnostic applications. Here, we describe our global gene expression studies applied to prostate cancer epithelial cells using LNCaP derivative C4-2 cells, with altered androgen responsiveness. Irradiation used as a prototypic genotoxic stress response model system has revealed many induced and repressed genes. For those genes repressed by genotoxic stress that are candidate radiation sensitive genes we seek a better understanding of their mechanisms of coordinate expression. A list of genes repressed at two-fold level or higher among irradiated C4-2 cells was identified, and functional groups of genes were designated using Gene Ontology annotations. Additionally, promoter sequences of genes from the top two functional clusters were examined to identify the presence of TF binding sites (TFBS) of interest. Genes with detected TFBS were further considered as candidates for functional studies as potential target genes. Here we report the cooccurrence of predicted TFBS for E2F, p53, and WT1 within the promoters of radiation suppressed mitotic genes. Examining relationships between TFs and their potential target genes will provide important insight into pathways essential for prostate cancer progression that could lead to the development of the next generation of diagnostics and therapeutics. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {Drought affected rice areas are predicted to double by the end of this century, demanding greater tolerance in widely adapted mega-varieties. Progress on incorporating better drought tolerance has been slow due to lack of appropriate phenotyping protocols. Furthermore, existing protocols do not consider the effect of drought and heat interactions, especially during the critical flowering stage, which could lead to false conclusion about drought tolerance. Screening germplasm and mapping-populations to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL)/candidate genes for drought tolerance is usually conducted in hot dry seasons where water supply can be controlled. Hence, results from dry season drought screening in the field could be confounded by heat stress, either directly on heat sensitive processes such as pollination or indirectly by raising tissue temperature through reducing transpirational cooling under water deficit conditions. Drought-tolerant entries or drought-responsive candidate genes/QTL identified from germplasm highly susceptible to heat stress during anthesis/flowering have to be interpreted with caution. During drought screening, germplasm tolerant to water stress but highly susceptible to heat stress has to be excluded during dry and hot season screening. Responses to drought and heat stress in rice are compared and results from field and controlled environment experiments studying drought and heat tolerance and their interaction are discussed. © 2011 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {This scientific opinion describes the influence of genetic parameters that have affected the welfare of commercial broilers. There is a lack of robust scientific data for Europe on welfare outcome indicators and these should be recorded independently and made publicly available. The major welfare concerns that have a genetic basis and that may interact with management factors to lead to poor welfare include skeletal disorders, contact dermatitis, ascites and sudden death syndrome. Most of these are linked with fast growth rates. There are also numerous interactions between the environment and the genetic traits that can seriously adversely affect welfare in areas such as lighting regimes, litter management, dietary deficiencies and contamination, air quality and temperature. In the risk assessment the probability of exposure to a hazard, and the magnitude of the poor welfare effects (consequences) of that exposure were estimated. The major risk scores were unbalanced body conformation, high stocking density, fast growth rate, low light intensity and wet litter. The top ranking environmental hazards were high stocking density, low light intensity and wet litter. It was recognised by the experts that probabilities vary from region to region, country to country and among different types of farming system. Recommendations include better data collection in Europe, greater selection strategies for improved welfare traits with birds being selected and tested for their subsequent rearing and production environments by the breeders. Finally, a high priority should be given to decreasing the proportion of birds with the higher gait scores, and to include contact dermatitis and other welfare traits in the selection schemes. © 2010 European Food Safety Authority},

A total of 300 animals were genotyped for the LEP/. BsaAI (Y_11369.1:g.1620G > A), DGAT1-VNTR (18-bp repeat element in the promoter region) and FABP4/. MspA1I (AAFC_01136716.1:g.7516G > C) polymorphisms and phenotyped for rib eye area, backfat thickness (BT), intramuscular fat, shear force, and myofibrillar fragmentation index. The allele substitution effects for each of the polymorphisms on the traits of interest were estimated by regression on the number of copies of a particular allele using the General Linear Model procedure. To keep the experiment wise error rate to the specified level, the Bonferroni adjustment was applied. Although the LEP/. BsaAI polymorphism has shown segregation for association studies in Nelore cattle [f(A) = 0.351], no associations were observed between its alleles and the traits analyzed. The DGAT1-VNTR was found to be polymorphic in Nelore cattle, as well as a potential association with BT. In addition to being non-informative in Nelore animals (allele C was found to be fixed), the FABP4/. MspA1I polymorphism showed no association with the studied traits in crossbred animals. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Calpains display limited proteolytic activity at neutral pH, proteolysing substrates to transform and modulate their structures and activities, and are therefore called "modulator proteases". The human genome has 15 genes that encode a calpain-like protease domain, generating diverse calpain homologues that possess combinations of several functional domains such as Ca2+-binding domains and Zn-finger domains. The importance of the physiological roles of calpains is reflected in the fact that particular defects in calpain functionality cause a variety of deficiencies in many different organisms, including lethality, muscular dystrophies, lissencephaly, and tumorigenesis. In this review, the unique characteristics of this distinctive protease superfamily are introduced in terms of genetically modified animals, some of which are animal models of calpain deficiency diseases.},

During the studied period over 5.6 million rabbits were slaughtered. In 280,686 carcasses quality changes on account of morbidity occurred, which constitutes 4.94% of the examined carcasses. Of these carcasses 59,428 were considered unfit for consumption, i.e. 21.17%, and 1.05% of all carcasses, which were examined after slaughter. The most common diseases confirmed were parasitic invasions, primarily coccidia (65.13%). However, the most common reasons for considering carcasses as unfit for consumption were bacterial diseases (sepsis and pyemia - 34.93%) as well as coccidiosis (28.96%). The most frequent qualitative changes of rabbit carcasses were excessive thinness (2%) or insufficient bloodlessness (1.64% of the confirmed changes). All of the carcasses in which these changes have been confirmed were considered unfit for consumption. Starting from 2006 the percentage of carcasses in which post-slaughter changes were confirmed has systematically decreased, while from 2008 the same concerns carcasses unfit for consumption. At the same time, the percentage of carcasses considered unfit for consumption from among the animals with confirmed qualitative changes after post-slaughter examination decidedly increased. This proves the good health of the rabbit population raised for slaughter in Poland, as well as its proper sanitary-veterinary control, which guarantees the high quality of the meat gained from it.},

	abstract = {The objective of the study was to determine the effect of genotype and feeding regime on enteric methane production, non-milk nitrogen and production performance during the winter feeding period. Two sets of traits were studied in four dairy production systems. One set of traits, represented the polluting effect of dairy cows to the environment and the other represented cow production performance. To quantify the impact of dairy cows on the atmospheric environment, enteric methane per kg milk was estimated while non-milk nitrogen was estimated to quantify the potential pollution of dairy cows to ground water resources. The cow performance traits were energy corrected milk yield (ECM) and body energy content (EC). After correcting for systematic factors, highly significant differences were found between the production systems on their impact on the environment. Generally, an increase in production performance in terms of milk yield was associated with a decrease in enteric methane production per kg of milk. However, non-milk N per kg milk increased in the average genetic merit groups while non-milk N per ha increased in the more intensive production systems. This apparent trade-off highlights the importance of the need to incorporate the dynamics of emission burden and pollution potential of different dairy systems when characterising different dairy systems. Including the environmental cost of dairying in the general description of different dairy production systems will not only improve productivity but also not compromise the environment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Host inflammatory response and cranial cartilage lesions were the main correlates with whirling behavior. Canonical correlation analyses showed that the prevalence of trout with severe lesions in the cranial and jaw cartilages was highest in stream sites with a combination of high temperature and low specific conductivity. Our results reveal that environmental components can affect when and where a pathogen resides within the host, and manifestation of disease.

	abstract = {Exotic African grasses have been introduced into deteriorated semiarid grasslands in northern Mexico to stop soil erosion and improve land productivity. These species are characterized by larger size and greater seed productivity than natives, traits which may contribute to eventual displacement of native grasses. Invasion of natural ecosystems alters species composition and ecosystem functioning, making identification of the traits and mechanisms used by successful invaders vital to controlling this problem. A comparison was done of seed germination potential and seedling biomass allocation in two native grasses (Bouteloua gracilis and B. curtipendula) and five exotic African grasses (Eragrostis curvula, E. lehmanniana, E. superba, Melinum repens and Panicum coloratum). Treatments consisted of washed and unwashed seeds and sterilized and unsterilized soils. Only E. superba exhibited higher (P<0.05) germination rates than the native species. Due to their overall higher seed production, potential propagule production was highest in two of the exotic grasses (E. superba and E. curvula). Seed washing favored higher germination in the three Eragrostis grasses, whereas soil sterilization inhibited germination in B. curtipendula and E. curvula (P<0.05). Seedling growth variables indicated similar effects in biomass allocation. Propagule production is not necessarily the factor that most facilitates invasive success by an exotic grass species, while the lack of pathogenic microorganisms and/or presence of growth promoting microorganisms may play a vital role.},

	abstract = {Objective: To explore the effect of over-expression of tight junction protein claudin-6 upon the biological characters of breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Methods: The MCF-7 subline expressing a high level of claudin-6 was established by transfection with a pcDNA3. 1-claudin-6 expression vector. The expression of claudin-6 in mRJNA and its protein level were confirmed by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescent assays. Then the effect of claudin-6 upon cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. Colony-forming assays were used to examine 2-D and 3-D colony-forming capacities. Invasive and migratory traits of claudin-6 expressing cells were determined by Boyden chamber invasion assay and monolayer wound-healing assay. The structure and function of tight junctions in both parental and claudin-6 expression MCF-7 cells were evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance. Results: Immunofluorescent assays showed that transfected cells expressed claudin-6 on their membrane. Cells with a high level expression of claudin-6 grew slowly than control cells. Anchorage-independent growth, invasive and migratory traits also decreased substantially in cells with claudin-6 expression; whereas the transepithelial electrical resistance increased in the claudin-6 transfected cells. Conclusion: The up-regulation of claudin-6 expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells suppresses their malignant phenotypes with a correlation with the restoration of tight junction integrity. Claudin-6 may function as a cancer suppressor whose down-regulation contributes to the malignant progression of certain types of breast cancers.},

	abstract = {As water availability is critical for reproduction, terminal drought tolerance may involve water-saving traits. Experiments were undertaken under different vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and water regimes (water stress (WS) and well watered (WW)) to test genotypic differences and trait relationships in the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) at which transpiration declines, canopy conductance (proxied by transpiration rate (TR, g H2Ocm -2h-1)), canopy temperature depression (CTD, °C), transpiration efficiency (TE, gkg-1) and growth parameters, using 15 contrasting cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) genotypes. Under WW conditions at the vegetative and early podding stages, plant mass and leaf area were larger under low VPD, and was generally lower in tolerant than in sensitive genotypes. Several tolerant lines had lower TR under WW conditions and restricted TR more than sensitive lines under high VPD. Under WS conditions, transpiration declined at a lower FTSW in tolerant than in sensitive lines. Tolerant lines also maintained higher TR and CTD under severe stress. TE was higher in tolerant genotypes under WS conditions. Significant relationships were found between TR, and TE, CTD and FTSW under different water regimes. In summary, traits that condition how genotypes manage limited water resources discriminated between tolerant and sensitive lines. Arguably, a lower canopy conductance limits plant growth and plant water use, and allows tolerant lines to behave like unstressed plants until the soil is drier and to maintain a higher TR under severe stress, as lower TR at high VPD leads to higher TE. © 2012 CSIRO.},

	abstract = {Objectives: The aim is to demonstrate significant polymerization shrinkage stress reduction in model resins through incorporation of addition-fragmentation chain transfer moieties that promote network stress accommodation by molecular rearrangement. Monomers containing allyl sulfide linkages are incorporated to affect the shrinkage stress that arises during photopolymerization of model resins that contain an initiator and dimethacrylates. Radical-mediated allyl sulfide addition-fragmentation is enabled during polymerization. We hypothesize that allyl sulfide incorporation into methacrylate polymerizations promotes stress relaxation by enabling network adaptation. Methods: A 1:2 mixture of tetrathiol and allyl sulfide-containing divinyl ethers is formulated with glass-forming dimethacrylates and compared to controls where the allyl sulfide is replaced with a propyl sulfide that is incapable of undergoing addition-fragmentation. Simultaneous shrinkage stress and functional group conversion measurements are performed. The Tg is determined by DMA. Results: Increasing allyl sulfide concentration reduces the relative stress by up to 75% in the resins containing the maximum amount of allyl sulfide. In glassy systems, at much lower allyl sulfide concentrations, the stress is reduced by up to 20% as compared to propyl sulfide-containing systems incapable of undergoing addition-fragmentation chain transfer. Significance: Shrinkage stress reduction, typically accompanying free-radical polymerization, is a primary focus in dental materials research and new product development. Allyl sulfide addition-fragmentation chain transfer is utilized as a novel approach to reduce stress in ternary thiol-ene-methacrylate polymerizations. The stress reduction effect depends directly on the allyl sulfide concentration in the given ternary systems, with stress reduction observed even in systems possessing super-ambient Tgs and low allyl sulfide concentrations.},

	abstract = {The white clover is a forage legume very important for use in temperate pastures in Rio Grande do Sul. However it is more sensitive to water deficit in the soil than other perennial legumes, presenting a lack of persistence in the summer. With the objective of determining morphophysiological traits related to the answer to the water deficit of this species, an experiment was carried out in greenhouse, which evaluated the effect of water availability (90 and 40% of the soil moisture field capacity) on seven genotypes belonging to the white clover core collection from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The experimental design used was completely random, with four repetitions, totaling 56 pots. Two evaluations were made, at 130 and 196 days after the sowing, when several traits were measured. The analysis of the results indicated that the water deficit had an outstanding effect on most of the variables, such as plant height (PH), foliar area (FA), number of alive leaves (NAL), length of primary stolon (LPS), dry matter of the aerial part (DMAP), photosynthesis rates (A), conductance (g), and water use efficiency (WUE). In both evaluations, regardless the water availability, there were positive and highly significant correlations (P<0.01) between LPS and NAL (r ≥ 0.51), as well as between FA and PH (r ≥ 0.62). Therefore, the best access under stress was the 1, which presented larger productions of DMAP at the 90% level and one of the most productions of DMAP under stress. The NAL and the A are morphological traits that could be used for early white clover selection for tolerance to water stress.},

	abstract = {Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder, is characterized as frequent upper airway collapse and obstruction. It is a treatable disorder but if left untreated is associated with complications in several organ systems. The health risk to OSA patients shows a strong association with acute cardiovascular events, and with chronic conditions. To the central nervous system, OSA causes behavioral and neuropsychologic deficits including daytime sleepiness, depression, impaired memory, mood disorders, cognition deficiencies, language comprehension and expression deficiencies, all of which are compatible with impaired hippocampal function. Furthermore, there exists a significant correlation between disease severity and cognitive deficits in OSA. Children with severe OSA have significantly lower intelligence quotient (IQ) and executive control functions compared to normal children matched for age, gender and ethnicity. This corroborates the findings of several pediatric studies of cognition in childhood OSA, where deficits are reported in general intelligence and some measures of executive function. In studies of OSA, it is difficult to differentiate the effects of its two main pathologic traits, intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sleep fragmentation. Many OSA studies, utilize IH as the only exposure factor in OSA studies. These approaches simplify research process and attain most of the academic goals. IH, continuous hypoxia and intermittent continuous hypoxia can all result in decreases in arterial O 2. There are striking differences to them in the response of physiological systems. There are multiple studies showing that IH treatment in a rodent model of OSA can impair performance of standard water maze tests associated with deficits in spatial learning and memory which most likely are hippocampal-dependent. Cellular damage to the hippocampal cornuammonis 1 (CA1) region likely contributes to neuropsychological impairment among OSA patients, since neural circuits in the hippocampus are important in learning and memory. In this article, studies of hippocampal impairments from IH are reviewed for elucidating the mechanisms and relationships between hippocampal impairments and IH of OSA.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work was to compare a model based on the use of an average numerator relationship matrix (ANRM) and a hierarchical animal model (HIER) to indicate the most appropriate statistical procedure to better estimate the genetic value of Nellore animals that have unknown paternity. The data set contained records of 62,212 Nellore animals. The pedigree file contained a total of 75,088 animals. Two approaches were adopted for the treatment of uncertain paternity. In the model based on the use of the ANRM probabilities were attributed to each of the possible parents of the animals with uncertain paternity. The other method adopted in the present study, i.e., the HIER, considers uncertainty in the assignment of paternity of animals participating in the multiple-sire (MS) system. Within this context, a priori probabilities are assigned to each possible sire of animals with uncertain paternity, which are altered according to information present in the data for the generation of posterior probabilities. Univariate analyses were carried out under Bayesian approach via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, implementing a chain of 400,000 rounds where the first 10,000 rounds were discarded (burn-in period). Models were compared by deviance information criteria (DIC) and pseudo Bayes factors (PBF). The model that best fits the data for estimating genetic parameter of animals with uncertain paternity is the Bayesian hierarchical model. Nevertheless, for genetic evaluation, the choice between these models would have no impact on genetic value classification of animals for selection. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Malignant progression in cancer requires populations of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) endowed with unlimited self renewal, survival under stress, and establishment of distant metastases. Additionally, the acquisition of invasive properties driven by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for the evolution of neoplastic cells into fully metastatic populations. Here, we characterize 2 human cellular models derived from prostate and bladder cancer cell lines to better understand the relationship between TIC and EMT programs in local invasiveness and distant metastasis. The model tumor subpopulations that expressed a strong epithelial gene program were enriched in highly metastatic TICs, while a second subpopulation with stable mesenchymal traits was impoverished in TICs. Constitutive overexpression of the transcription factor Snai1 in the epithelial/ TIC-enriched populations engaged a mesenchymal gene program and suppressed their self renewal and metastatic phenotypes. Conversely, knockdown of EMT factors in the mesenchymal-like prostate cancer cell subpopulation caused a gain in epithelial features and properties of TICs. Both tumor cell subpopulations cooperated so that the nonmetastatic mesenchymal-like prostate cancer subpopulation enhanced the in vitro invasiveness of the metastatic epithelial subpopulation and, in vivo, promoted the escape of the latter from primary implantation sites and accelerated their metastatic colonization. Our models provide new insights into how dynamic interactions among epithelial, self-renewal, and mesenchymal gene programs determine the plasticity of epithelial TICs.},

	abstract = {Destructive burns and traumas which create composite tissue damages, as well as intractable wounds, usually cause the difficulties or inefficacy in the repair and management through ordinary skin grafting or tissue transplantation owing to the complex defects, unhealthy healing condition, or high requirements for the function and appearance reconstruction of the injured local tissues. The advantages of free tissue transplantation with microsurgical techniques in the tissue repair and reconstruction have been demonstrated as meeting the composite tissues restoration, improving blood supply, avoiding further damage to the wound surrounding tissues, and simplifying the distant tissue transplantation procedure, and therefore significantly decreasing the deformities with good functional and morphological outcomes, and dramatically reducing the hospitalization duration with less complications and faster restitution. In the present discussion, basing on the general literature review and the summary of our long-time clinical application of microsurgical techniques in dealing with serious injuries, we put forward the view that the microsurgical techniques should be considered as the first option for the treatment of destructive burns and traumas, and intractable wounds. And in some cases, only microsurgical techniques can be used, otherwise amputation would be unavoidable, or the optimal treatment would be abandoned or delayed. Meanwhile, it should be emphasized that the risk and the failure rate of performing microsurgical operation can be overcome through strictly hard training.},

	abstract = {In this study, we examined the in vitro invasion and proliferation capacities of the Nc-Liv and ten Spanish Neospora caninum isolates (Nc-Spain 1 H - Nc-Spain 10). The invasion rate was determined as the number of tachyzoites that completed their internalisation into MARC-145 cells at 2, 4, and 6 h post-inoculation (pi). The proliferation rate was evaluated by determining the doubling time during the exponential proliferation period. Significant differences in the invasion rates of these isolates were detected at 2 and 4 h pi (P < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test). At 4 h pi, the Nc-Spain 4 H and Nc-Liv isolates displayed the highest, while the Nc-Spain 3 H and Nc-Spain 1 H isolates had the lowest invasion rates (by Dunn's test). Variations in the proliferation kinetics of these isolates were also observed. Between different isolates, the lag phase, which occurs before the exponential growth phase, ranged from 8 to 44 h, and the doubling time ranged from 9.8 to 14.1 h (P = 0.0016, ANOVA test). Tachyzoite yield, which combines invasion and proliferation data, was also assessed and confirmed marked differences between the highly and less prolific isolates. Interestingly, a direct correlation between the invasion rates and tachyzoite yields, and the severity of the disease that was exhibited by infected pregnant mice in previous works could be established for the isolates in this study (Spearman's coefficient > 0.62, P < 0.05). The results of this study may help us to explain the differences in the pathogenicity that are displayed by different isolates. © 2011 Regidor-Cerrillo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Measures of polar axis (P), equatorial diameter (E), exine thickness, and analysis of pollen grains were obtained by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All genotypes showed high rate of pollen viability (> 89%) for both stains. There were differences between genotypes in the following quantitative traits: polar axis, equatorial diameter, exine, endexine, ektexine, and P/E ratio. Pollen grains were characterized as small, monoporates, with circular and non-prominent apertures. In addition to helping distinction of pollen grains, morphometric differences can be used later to compare ploidy levels, thus assisting in breeding programs of the species.},

	abstract = {The global and anthropogenic climate change and variability, mainly global warming, is having measurable effects on ecosystems, communities, and populations. The combination of climate change and environmental degradation has created ideal conditions for the emergence, resurgence and spread of infectious diseases, and has led to growing concerns due to the effects of climate on health. Diverse environmental factors affect the distribution, diversity, incidence, severity, or persistence of diseases and other health effects - something that has been recognized for millennia. An important risk of climate change is its potential impact on the evolution and emergence of infectious disease agents. Evidence is indicating that the atmospheric and oceanic processes that occur in response to increased greenhouse gases in the broad-scale climate system may already be changing the ecology of infectious diseases. Ecosystem instabilities brought about by climate change and concurrent stresses such as land use changes, species dislocation, and increasing global travel could potentially influence the genetics of pathogenic microbes through mutation and horizontal gene transfer, giving rise to new interactions among hosts and disease agents. Recent studies have shown that climate also influences the abundance and ecology of pathogens, and the links between pathogens and changing ocean conditions, including human diseases such as cholera. Vibrio cholerae is well recognized as being responsible for significant mortality and economic loss in underdeveloped countries, most often centered in tropical areas of the world. Generally, V. cholerae is transmitted through contaminated food and water in communities that do not have access to proper sewage and water treatment systems, and is thus called, ?the disease of poverty?. During the last three decades, extensive research has been carried out to elucidate the virulence properties and the epidemiology of this pathogen. Within the marine environment, V. cholerae is found attached to surfaces provided by plants, filamentous green algae, copepods, crustaceans, and insects. The specific environmental changes that amplified plankton and associated bacterial proliferation and govern the location and timing of plankton blooms have been elucidated. Several studies have demonstrated that environmental non-O1 and non-O139 V. cholerae strains and V. cholerae O1 El Tor and O139 are able to form a three-dimensional biofilm on surfaces which provides a microenvironment, facilitating environmental persistence within natural aquatic habitats during interepidemic periods. Revealing the influence of climatic/environmental factors in seasonal patterns is critical to understanding temporal variability of cholera at longer time scales to improve disease forecasting. Recently, researchers have also been elucidating the environmental lifestyle of V. cholerae, and ecologically based models have been developed to define the role of environment, weather, and climate-related variables in outbreaks of this disease. This chapter provides current evidence for the influence of environmental factors on Vibrio cholerae dynamics and virulence traits of this organism, and the urgent need for action to prevent the consequences of climate change contributing to cholera. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The Hungarian adapted versions of 1) JTCI using four temperament and three character traits, 2) the brief DAS of Burns, 3) the Ways of Coping questionnaire of Lazarus and Folkmann, and 4) the JHLES were administered to 498 14- to 18-year -old youths drawn from 5 Hungarian regional child and adolescent outpatient facilities. 3 anxiety disorders were chosen assessed by MINI Plus questionnaire. Seeking differential predictors between the syndromes a 2 dtep logistic regression was performed. Results. The main predictors of Panic-agoraphobia were harm-avoidance and autonomy/outward control,the differential characteristics regarding Social phobia were HA and lack of persistence coupled with avoidance of risky problem solving. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)showed only HA again as an important predictor distinguishing GAD from the other anxiety syndromes. Stresses and suicidal factors had no differentiating role between the disorders. Conclusions. A few but signifcant differential predictors were found distinguishing Panic-agoraphobic patients,social phobics and those suffering from GAD from one another.There are only few specifc predictive risk factors evident as essentially differing within anxiety syndromes. © Versita Sp. z o.o.},

The investigated wheat cultivars were grown in two successive years: 2006, which was very favorable for wheat cultivation, and 2007, when one of the most severe and long-lasting droughts in Bulgaria was registered. The genotypes were grown in a complex scheme involving four previous crops and three levels of mineral fertilization, according to the type of previous crop. Grain yield and the following productivity components were studied: 1000 kernel weight, test weight, number of productive tillers, plant height, number and weight of grains per spike. The correlation of grain yield with the related traits was analyzed under contrasting environments. It was found out that the drought in 2007 caused about 30 % decrease of the productivity of the investigated common wheat genotypes. The reduction of grain yield was due to the lower weight of grains per spike (about 40%), the lower number of grains per spike (about 29%) and the smaller size of grains (about 15%). The independent effects of the genotype and the mineral fertilization were much better expressed on the studied traits under the favorable conditions of 2006, and the type of previous crop had significant effect under drought. The relation of grain yield with the number of productive tillers, plant height, weight and number of grains per spike was higher under stress during the growth period of the crop.},

Lower (22%) feed intake from weaning until week 11 was noted for organic pigs. As a consequence, organic pigs had lower growth rate persisting until week 22. In the last phase (weeks 22 to 26) when food intake was limited, growth rate declined in conventional, and increased in organic, pigs. All pigs were slaughtered at the usual commercial age (26 weeks). Due to the slower growth, organic pigs had lower carcass weight, dressing %, smaller longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle, and lighter hams, while no differences were observed in fat tissue measurements and carcass leanness (the exception being the area of fat over LD). Analysis for the same slaughter weight indicated that organic pigs would have fatter carcasses as conventional pigs if slaughtered at the same weight. With regard to meat quality, a higher ultimate pH and intramuscular fat content were observed for organic pigs. The results of the present study indicate possible problems (lower feed intake, growth retardation) associated with the use of commercially available organic diets for piglets. On the other hand such diets can increase intramuscular fat content, which is interesting in terms of improved meat quality.},

The reasons underlying the fragmentary distribution of the species belonging to the family Capromyidae over the Antilles and Bahamas is also considered. Samples of four geographically distant hutia (genera Capromys and Mysateles) populations inhabiting different biotypes were assessed according to 32 allozyme loci. It has been demonstrated that the interpopulation and subspecies differentiation in the gene frequencies in these genera is very low. As for the pattern of polymorphism (Shannon?s measure), the populations and subspecies within these genera are well differentiated and adequate to their morphological differentiation. This suggests that the genetic divergence pattern of hutias in post-Pleistocene was predominantly determined by selection on the background of a relatively rapid formation of multiple morphotypes. It is assumed that the evolution within the family Capromyidae in the earlier and the later periods was associated with the geomorphological and climatic events in the history of the Earth. This standpoint provides for explaining the phenomena of both the excessive taxonomic status of the Cuban Capromyinae and the fragmentary distribution of these species over the Antilles and Bahamas, amazing at a first glance.},

	abstract = {Attempts to improve beef tenderness through supplementation with dietary vitamin D 3 have been challenged by null results and negative impacts on animal performance and carcass traits. Because vitamin D 3 is also synthesised by the animal via ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, the effectiveness of supplementation with dietary vitamin D 3 may be modulated by the degree of exposure of the animal to sunlight. Hence, this work aimed to verify whether dietary vitamin D 3 modifies meat quality without negatively affecting animal performance and carcass traits in B. indicus beef cattle that were either exposed to or protected from natural sunlight. Forty-two (411±38kg) Nellore-type castrated males were fed a high-concentrate diet for 45days after assignment to a treatment group. The treatments comprised combinations of three levels of vitamin D 3 [ViTD - none (V0) or 2×10 6IU of vitamin D 3 administered for either 2 (V2) or 8 (V8) consecutive days pre-slaughter] and two shading conditions (SHADE - unshaded or shaded). The post-mortem (pm) measurements were taken in the Longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle. The animal performance and carcass traits were unaffected by ViTD or SHADE. The V2 treatment increased the Myofibrillar Fragmentation Index in shaded animals compared to unshaded ones. Animals under shade had higher muscle calcium concentration. There was no effect of either ViTD or SHADE on the shear force. The L * values were higher at 24h pm than at 0 and 1h pm, with no differences among the animals in the ViTD or SHADE groups. Higher a * values were observed among animals in the V8 group than in the V0 group, and higher b * values were observed among animals in the V8 group than in the V2 or V0 groups, which were not different. In conclusion, ViTD and SHADE did not affect animal performance, carcass traits or shear force, whereas animals receiving a lower ViTD dosage and SHADE exhibited altered myofibrillar fragmentation. ViTD affected the colour parameters, and changes in the lightness of the beef related to the time pm were found in meat from animals under SHADE. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The global rate of heavy metal pollution is rapidly increasing in various habitats. Anopheles malaria vector species (Diptera: Culicidae) appear to tolerate many aquatic habitats with metal pollutants, despite their normal proclivity for 'clean' water (i.e. low levels of organic matter). Investigations were conducted to establish whether there are biological costs for tolerance to heavy metals in Anopheles gambiae Giles sensu stricto and to assess the potential impact of heavy metal pollution on mosquito ecology. Anopheles gambiae s.s. were selected for cadmium, copper or lead tolerance through chronic exposure of immature stages to solutions of the metals for three successive generations. Biological costs were assessed in the fourth generation by horizontal life table analysis. Tolerance in larvae to cadmium (as cadmium chloride, CdCl2), copper [as copper II nitrate hydrate, Cu(NO3)2 2.5 H2O] and lead [as lead II nitrate, Pb(NO3)2], monitored by changes in LC50 concentrations of the metals, changed from 6.07 μg/L, 12.42 μg/L and 493.32 μg/L to 4.45 μg/L, 25.02 μg/L and 516.69 μg/L, respectively, after three generations of exposure. The metal-selected strains had a significantly lower magnitude of egg viability, larval and pupal survivorship, adult emergence, fecundity and net reproductive rate than the control strain. The population doubling times were significantly longer and the instantaneous birth rates lower in most metal-selected strains relative to the control strain. Our results suggest that although An. gambiae s.s. displays the potential to develop tolerance to heavy metals, particularly copper, this may occur at a significant biological cost, which can adversely affect its ecological fitness. © 2010 The Authors.

While the sequence in which a cancer cell acquires the necessary traits for tumour formation can vary, there are a number of mechanisms that are common to most, if not all, cancers across the spectrum of possible causes. Many aspects of carcinogenesis can be modelled in vitro. This has led to the development of a number of mechanistically driven, cell-based assays to assess the pro-carcinogenic and anti-carcinogenic potential of chemicals. A review is presented of the current in vitro models that can be used to study carcinogenesis, with examples of cigarette smoke testing in some of these models, in order to illustrate their potential applications. We present an overview of the assays used in regulatory genotoxicity testing, as well as those designed to model other aspects that are considered to be hallmarks of cancer. The latter assays are described with a view to demonstrating the recent advances in these areas, to a point where they should now be considered for inclusion in an overall testing strategy for chemical carcinogens.},

	abstract = {The New Zealand (NZ) economy and its dairy industry are sensitive to global consumer perception of farming practices used to generate milk products because milk exports account for > 25% of national export earnings and > 90% of milk produced is exported as products. Astute management of product image and market risk is, therefore, important for the viability of the industry and country. More than 95% of milk produced in NZ comes from strictly seasonal, pasture-based systems, with associated constraints on reproductive performance. Increasing herd sizes, operational changes and genetic selection priorities have further challenged dairy farmers to achieve optimal levels of herd fertility. Reproductive management practices have developed to address the need to maintain a 365-day inter-calving interval, essentially through maximizing the number of cyclic cows during the breeding period and minimizing the duration of the seasonal calving period. Aspects of the hormonal interventions developed and routinely used to achieve these objectives have been the subject of product quality and market risk concerns forcing the industry to explore alternative ways of achieving reproductive performance goals. One approach has been to exploit the inherently high level of fertility in NZ dairy herds. This approach has seen the inclusion of fertility-related traits in the national genetic evaluation system to prevent further decline in genetic fertility. More recently, a nationally coordinated extension program has been adopted to support farmers and their advisors to identify, prioritize and improve on key management areas for incremental gains in herd reproductive performance. Advances in automation and bio-sensing are yet to make a significant impact, but remain potentially valuable additions in supporting the dairy farmer to manage the areas having the largest effects on reproductive performance.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate the combined effects of elevated CO2 levels and cadmium (Cd) on the root morphological traits and Cd accumulation in Lolium multiflorum Lam. and Lolium perenne L. exposed to two CO2 levels (360 and 1 000 μl/L) and three Cd levels (0, 4, and 16 mg/L) under hydroponic conditions. The results show that elevated levels of CO2 increased shoot biomass more, compared to root biomass, but decreased Cd concentrations in all plant tissues. Cd exposure caused toxicity to both Lolium species, as shown by the restrictions of the root morphological parameters including root length, surface area, volume, and tip numbers. These parameters were significantly higher under elevated levels of CO2 than under ambient CO2, especially for the number of fine roots. The increases in magnitudes of those parameters triggered by elevated levels of CO2 under Cd stress were more than those under non-Cd stress, suggesting an ameliorated Cd stress under elevated levels of CO2. The total Cd uptake per pot, calculated on the basis of biomass, was significantly greater under elevated levels of CO2 than under ambient CO 2. Ameliorated Cd toxicity, decreased Cd concentration, and altered root morphological traits in both Lolium species under elevated levels of CO2 may have implications in food safety and phytoremediation. © 2011 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The study of malaria parasites on the Indian subcontinent should help us understand unexpected disease outbreaks and unpredictable disease presentations from Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections. The Malaria Evolution in South Asia (MESA) research program is one of ten International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health. In this second of two reviews, we describe why population structures of Plasmodia in India will be characterized and how we will determine their consequences on disease presentation, outcome and patterns. Specific projects will determine if genetic diversity, possibly driven by parasites with higher genetic plasticity, plays a role in changing epidemiology, pathogenesis, vector competence of parasite populations and whether innate human genetic traits protect Indians from malaria today. Deep local clinical knowledge of malaria in India will be supplemented by basic scientists who bring new research tools. Such tools will include whole genome sequencing and analysis methods; in vitro assays to measure genome plasticity, RBC cytoadhesion, invasion, and deformability; mosquito infectivity assays to evaluate changing parasite-vector compatibilities; and host genetics to understand protective traits in Indian populations. The MESA-ICEMR study sites span diagonally across India and include a mixture of very urban and rural hospitals, each with very different disease patterns and patient populations. Research partnerships include government-associated research institutes, private medical schools, city and state government hospitals, and hospitals with industry ties. Between 2012 and 2017, in addition to developing clinical research and basic science infrastructure at new clinical sites, our training workshops will engage new scientists and clinicians throughout South Asia in the malaria research field. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

With its ability to enhance existing or introduce entirely novel characteristics at unprecedented magnitude and speed this emerging technology is expected to have a profound impact on the genetic improvement of livestock in the future. The continual advances in animal genomics towards the identification of genes that influence livestock production traits and impact on human health will increase its ability and versatility for the purposeful modification of livestock animals to enhance their welfare, produce superior quality food and biomedical products and reduce the environmental impact of farming. In contrast to biomedicine, which has so far been the main driver for this technology platform, the potential opportunities for animal agriculture are more challenging because of the greater demands on cost, efficiency, consumer acceptance and relative value of the product. While various transgenic concepts for the genetic improvement of livestock animals for agriculture are being evaluated the integration of this technology into practical farming systems remains some distance in the future. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The climate is under continuous changes due to human action. This fact raises ethical questions concerning the adaptation to the predicted changes, the duty not to engage with harmful activities, and the duties of restoration. Typically, ethical issues are addressed either in terms of individual or collective responsibility. In the former case, the focus is on individuals and on her actions and omissions; in the latter case, the focus is on the collective aspect of human life that is governed and regulated through formal institutions and structures such as legislative systems and public policies. The paper aims to study the cultural implications deriving from these ethical considerations of anthropogenic climate change. These cultural aspects seem to have a life of their own and are difficult to regulate if not specifically addressed. Accordingly, I distinguish between three approaches to environmental policy: consumerist, institutionalist and cultural. The institutionalist approach puts emphasis on legal and social structures and processes governed by formal rules. The consumerist approach focuses on the individual choices and lifestyle. I claim that to get a more comprehensive picture, attention must also be paid to cultural dimensions that are not fully governed by individuals and that either should not be controlled through formal laws in a liberal-democratic society. Such cases are stemming from various aspects of the human mobility, kinship relations, symbolic activities and rituals which can be best analysed through cultural criticism that rests on (environmental) ethical concepts and ideas. It is difficult for individuals to avoid fulfilling certain social expectations that are of cultural nature. Although visiting faraway living relatives or attending religious ceremony afar from home and thus causing GHG-emissions is, in the end, an individual decision, it has a strong cultural dimension. At times, cultural ideals can be unsustainable. It seems that the cultural approach must tackle at least two fundamental problems: First, if a cultural practice is regarded as unsustainable, its criticism might not have a recipient because it is an abstract trait of a common life of some group of people. And second, there may not be standards of criticism independently of specific cultures. © 2012 Wageningen Academic Publishers. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Breeding objectives for meat sheep in Ireland have been defined and used in the development of selection sub-indices to provide commercial producers with an economic comparison of animals for specific performance trait groups. Using trait-by-trait bio-economic models and a range of methodologies, economic weights (in € per lamb born per genetic standard deviation in the trait) have been calculated for maternal and terminal sire performance traits as follows: production traits; -€1.41 for days to slaughter, €0.35 for carcase conformation class, -€0.52 for carcase fat class, lambing traits; -€0.69 for lambing difficulty for single-bearing ewes, -€0.37 for lambing difficulty for multiple-bearing ewes, €1.15 for lamb survival, maternal traits; €0.83 for number of lambs born, -€1.49 for ewe mature weight, health traits; -€0.09 for lamb foot rot, and -€0.82 for ewe foot rot. Results indicate the significant value of improving the ability of lambs to survive to weaning, without increasing number of lambs born. The highly negative economic weight for both days to slaughter and mature size represents a powerful unfavourable relationship between the two traits. Economic values for lambing difficulty and foot rot represent the significant costs these traits have in the Irish sheep production system.In the early stages of the development of the genetic improvement program for sheep in Ireland the breeding objective defined in this paper provides directed emphasis for trait recording, selection strategies, and mating systems. In addition the economic weights provide indications as to how much genetic improvement in a specific trait would be worth paying for. The proposed formulation of the total economic index as sub-indices provides the ability for commercial farmers to adjust breeding emphasis towards specific market outcomes or address key production aspects in their particular farming system. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

For the first analysis, participants were divided into four broad groups: those owning traditional pets (e.g., cats, dogs), those owning cold-blooded exotic pets, those owning warm-blooded exotic pets, and those not owning animals. For the second analysis, participants were subdivided into nine groups, based on species of animal owned: cats, dogs, birds, fish, reptiles, spider/insect, small mammals, owners of many different animals, and non-owners. In both analyses, separate analyses of variance were applied to the scores of the NEO-FFI scales. Interaction effects between sex and several ownership groups on the traits Openness to Experience and Agreeableness were found in both analyses. Female owners of traditional pets scored, for example, significantly lower on openness to experience than female owners of cold-blooded exotic pets as well as male owners of traditional pets. Furthermore, female owners of cold-blooded exotic pets scored significantly higher on openness to experience than their male counterparts. Regarding agreeableness, male owners of cold-blooded exotic pets scored significantly lower than their female counterparts as well as male owners of traditional pets. These and other results indicate that personality may affect choice of pets-but in different directions for the two sexes. © ISAZ 2011.},

	abstract = {Ticks and tick-borne diseases are of global importance, affecting livestock, human and companion animals. In particular, cattle ticks are responsible for severe economic losses in the tropics, with costs associated with parasite control along with losses in fertility, body weight and milk production. Ticks are also vectors of a variety of pathogens, with babesiosis, theileriosis and anaplasmosis being important diseases transmitted by ticks. While chemical control with acaricides has been a main tick control strategy, inadvertent selection of acaricide-resistant tick strains, which evolve faster than development of new chemicals, is a major cause for concern. Thus, exploiting host genetic resistance has a great potential to complement other control strategies and reduce the need for chemical control. Considerable variation both between and within breeds has been observed for tick resistance, with well-documented evidence of greater resistance of Bos indicus breeds compared with Bos taurus breeds. Tick load is affected by several genetically controlled morphological traits, such as coat colour and hair type, as well as genes related to the immune response. Within-breed heritability estimates vary from very low to high, depending on the evaluation method and the extent of parasite challenge, with mean values close to 0.3. Although this implies ample scope for selection, trait measurement remains difficult. Consequently, genetic markers would assist in selection under extensive farming conditions. For this purpose, quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies have been undertaken with results reported in this chapter. Tick-borne diseases are a more complex problem than ticks themselves, with resistance to such diseases not as well documented as resistance to ticks. In general, B. indicus cattle are more resistant to tick-borne diseases, with some evidence of variability in resistance to babesiosis and theileriosis. In summary, breeding for genetic resistance is potentially a promising means to control ticks, although the same cannot yet be stated for tick-borne diseases. Large efforts are currently being made in Australia and Brazil to develop genetic markers for tick resistance and to develop tick vaccines. © CAB International 2011.},

	abstract = {Despite the advances made in genomic studies in banana many challenges remain. There is need for better genetic resistance to pathogens and pests, greater yields and more efficient production for improving food security, greater yield stability, better use of water, less toxic chemical input, and higher quality. This chapter examines some of the issues facing the genetic improvement of Musa and makes proposals for future research in the crop. New data is making it possible to exploit comparative genomics to gain an understanding of Musa genetics. The initiation of the Musa Genomics Consortium seems to be bearing fruit as new initiatives in genomics research in Musa is growing. The use of molecular markers, marker-assisted breeding, gene pyramiding and linkage maps is briefly summarized. The chapter suggests that more comprehensive approaches, including quantitative and qualitative analyses of gene expression products, are necessary at the transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomic levels in Musa. The chapter highlights how new approaches such as RNA interference, TILLING, proteomics and metabolomics could revolutionize Musa research. A summary of the health aspects of banana is provided and reasons are given why bananas could be considered as an important source of pharmaceuticals and as a crop for biofortification. The scope for research in the biotic stresses that affect banana is still wide and the incidence of new diseases such as Xanthomonas wilt has opened new avenues for research. Transgenic plants have been developed for black Sigatoka, Xanthomonas wilt and nematode resistance but their efficacy in the fields has not been proven as yet. While much research has been done in the biotic stresses that affect banana including fungal diseases, nematodes, insects, viruses, and bacteria, little has been done with regards to abiotic stresses which may include drought, flooding, salinity, metal toxicity, mineral deficiency, adverse pH, adverse temperature, and air pollution. The chapter addresses the progress being made in addressing drought, saline and cold stress. Progress in crop genome sequencing, high resolution genetic mapping and precise phenotyping will accelerate the discovery of functional alleles and allelic variation that are associated with traits of interest for plant breeding. © 2012 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Exotic pathogens have been implicated in the decline and extinction of various native-island-bird species. Despite the fact that there is increasing concern about the introduction of diseases in island ecosystems, little is known about parasites in the islands of Macaronesia. We focus on Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii), an endemic and widespread Macaronesian bird species, using a combination of field studies and molecular techniques to determine: (1) the range and prevalence of avian pox and malaria in Berthelot's pipits throughout the species' distribution, (2) the genetic characterization of both parasites in order to ascertain the level of host specificity. We sampled 447 pipits across the 12 islands inhabited by this species. Overall, 8% of all individuals showed evidence of pox lesions and 16% were infected with avian malaria, respectively. We observed marked differences in the prevalence of parasites among islands both within and between archipelagos. Avian pox prevalence varied between 0-54% within and between archipelagos and avian malaria prevalence varied between 0-64% within and between archipelagos. The diversity of pathogens detected was low: only two genetic lineages of avian malaria and one lineage of avian pox were found to infect the pipit throughout its range. Interestingly, both avian malaria parasites found were Plasmodium spp. that had not been previously reported in the Macaronesian avifauna (but that had been observed in the lesser kestrel Falco naumannii), while the avian pox was a host specific lineage that had previously been reported on two of the Canary Islands. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides are heavily modified by inclusion of non-native amino acids, peptide cyclization and addition of nonpeptide moieties such as carbohydrates or fatty acids. Peptide acylation can significantly improve the antimicrobial potency of antimicrobial peptides, which primarily target the microbial membrane. This type of antimicrobi-als, which do not target a specific receptor and whose activity is based on the characteristic lipid composition of microbial membrane has the advantage that it takes microorganism several hundred generations at low concentrations of amphipathic antimicrobial peptide to achieve resistance. In particular, tryptophan and arginine residues have been shown to be almost indispensable due to their amphipathic and cationic character. For instance, arenicin-1, indolicidin, tritrpticin, pleurocidin, melittin, cecropin and so on are having these characteristics. And it also seems to be related to interaction ability in microbial phospholipid membranes. Tryptophan was the first enzyme for which a product formed at one site was demon-strated to be intramolecularly transferred to another site, contributing to substrate channeling. In the history of enzymology and structural biology, tryptophan residue has served a key role because its spatial and functional relationship was deeply investigated. The distinguishing structural characteristic of tryptophan is that it contains an indole functional group. Interestingly, some of antimicrobial peptide showed that tryptophan plays a pivotal role in the membrane-directed antimicrobial activity. The hydrophobic tryptophan residue may support a more efficient interaction with the fungal membrane and bacterial membrane surfaces allowing the peptides to partition into the bilayer interface, in contrast with other hydrophobic residues. Furthermore, chemicals involved indole functional group also possessed membrane interaction ability with antimicrobial effects. ©2012 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years there has been renewed interest in the adaptation of cattle to challenging environments, largely driven by advances in genomic methods. The current interest in tick resistance is understandable given the major production and welfare implications of tick infestation in tropical and subtropical zones where around 70% of beef cattle are located. Heritability for tick burden in cattle has been shown to range about 0.30, which is sufficient to result in the success of some programs of selection for tick resistance in cattle. Gene-expression studies strongly indicate that both immune and non-immune mechanisms are associated with tick resistance in cattle. Recent quantitative-trait mapping studies have identified chromosome segments and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with tick burden, but no causal variant has been identified so far. Most of the genetic markers identified for tick burden explain a relatively small proportion of the variance, which is typical of markers for quantitative traits. This leads to the conclusion that panels of multiple markers for tick resistance rather than a single marker will most likely be developed, possibly involving specific panels for zebu or taurine breeds, which could be used for future selection and breeding programs in cattle. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Pleiotropic effects from the transfer of other transgenes, particularly growth hormone gene can alter disease resistance in both positive and negative ways. Most negative effects for all transgenes appear to lower fitness traits, which is positive for biological containment. Transgenic fish appear to pose little environmental risk, but this research is not fully conclusive. To expedite commercialization and minimize environmental risk, transgenic sterilization research is underway.

Although individuals living in native communities have high rates of problem drinking, there is also variability in their drinking levels. The authors conducted a test of a model of First Nation drinking risk that incorporates personality and psychosocial learning to examine its cross-cultural applicability. That model identifies a risk process thought to explain aspects of individual differences in both native problem drinking and non-native problem drinking. One implication of the theory is that positive alcohol expectancies mediate the influence of negative urgency (the tendency to act rashly when distressed) on problem drinking similarly for both cultures.Methods: We administered questionnaires to a total of 211 First Nation people and 236 Caucasians.Results: A structural modeling analysis of 211 First Nation people and 236 Caucasian people found that (i) personality, alcohol expectancy, and problem drinking measures were invariant across the 2 cultures and (ii) results consistent with the hypothesis that positive alcohol expectancies mediated the influence of negative urgency on problem drinking were also invariant across culture.Conclusions: The findings support the theory that personality traits and psychosocial learning are important determinants of problem drinking in First Nation people and Caucasians. © 2010 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.},

	abstract = {The large American liver fluke, Fascioloides magna - introduced to Europe before 1875 - was the first non-indigenous trematode to be detected in Hungarian cervids in 1995. As the most precious deer population became infected in the Gemenc game reserve a study has been launched to assess the extent and the effect of F. magna infections and to examine the options for the treatment of infected deer populations. Livers of red deer shot during regular hunting were submitted for the survey and were investigated by necropsy for the presence of F. magna and other liver dwelling trematodes. Recovered parasites were counted, sorted and stored in 70% ethanol. Unexpectedly, blood flukes were found in liver blood vessels at necropsy. They were identified as Orientobilharzia turkestanica (Skrjabin, 1913) by their morphological features as well as by molecular methods. This parasite is widespread in the middle belt of Asia from Korea to the eastern part of Turkey and infects mainly bovids. It was never found in red deer until now and this is the first report of its occurrence in Hungary and Europe. A subsequent search for the local intermediate host of O. turkestanica in the Gemenc area identified only the pulmonate snail Radix auricularia (Linnaeus, 1758) [syn: Lymnaea auricularia] as a vector capable of producing cercariae of this trematode. Cercariae of O. turkestanica were examined morphologically and were confirmed to be the larvae of this trematode by PCR. O. turkestanica appears to be fairly common in red deer of the Gemenc area. No clinical or pathological effect of the infection could be identified in this study. A form of cercarial dermatitis locally called " water mange" was formerly attributed to the larvae of avian shistosomes. It regularly occurred among fishermen fishing in shallow ponds remaining after floods along the Danube in the Gemenc area. This isolated habitat of O. turkestanica presents an exceptional opportunity to study epidemical situations of typical mammalian schistosomosis under temperate climatic conditions. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cryptosporidiosis is an important and established cause of calfhood morbidity in bovines. The present communication reports the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection among juvenile and adult cattle (6-24 months old) in India based on examination of faecal samples collected from 350 animals across three different agro-climatic regions of the country and further confirmation by a two-step nested PCR assay targeting 18S ssu rRNA gene. A total of 45 samples were positive for Cryptosoridium species by nested PCR assay. The PCR products were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using SspI and VspI restriction enzymes for species differentiation. The results showed that the species involved in all the samples found positive was Cryptosporidium andersoni. The overall prevalence rate was 12.85%, with highest occurrence in the northern states (14.37%) of the country. The animals between age group of 6-12 months were mostly affected (21.67%) and the season wise prevalence of infection was more during the hot and humid monsoon season (20.16%). The results clearly demonstrated that C. andersoni is the major Cryptosporidium species affecting juvenile and adult cattle in three agro-climatically different geographical regions of India. This is the first report on prevalence of C. andersoni in bovines from India the confirmation of which is based on application of nested PCR and PCR-RFLP based molecular tools. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, this study focused on individual postmortem protein changes using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) based proteome analysis in the porcine longissimus dorsi muscles categorized by TPS. The low TPS group showed higher percentages of the MHC fast isoform (P < 0.05) and fiber type IIB (P < 0.01) than the high TPS group. Moreover, muscles with a higher extent of protein denaturation showed a lower muscle pH45 min (P < 0.01), paler surfaces (P < 0.01), and higher degrees of fluid loss by exudation (P < 0.01), as well as greater myofibrillar and metabolic protein degradation than muscles with a lower extent of protein denaturation. This study provides new evidence that myofibrillar and metabolic protein fragmentations using 2-DE based proteome analysis, particularly that of myosin, actin, the troponin T 4f isoform, and glycogen phosphorylase fragments, are useful for explaining variations in the degree of protein denaturation, and ultimate meat quality. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The salmonids, and in particular the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Onchorynchus mykiss), are 'pioneer species' in modern aquaculture and aquaculture breeding. Viral diseases currently constitute one of the largest challenges to the salmonid farming industry, and resistance to such diseases has become an important part of the goal of many breeding companies. Genetic variation in resistance has been demonstrated for a number of viral diseases both in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, with heritability estimates typically ranging from 0.2 to 0.4. The results that are available indicate that genetic correlations between diseases are generally low. For both species and several diseases, response to selection has been experimentally demonstrated. Resistance towards one or more viral diseases is part of the breeding goal of most or all ongoing breeding programmes. Selection is usually based on controlled challenge tests, and since challenge-tested animals cannot be used as brood stock, the within-family component of genetic variation is thus not utilized. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance towards specific diseases have been searched for, motivated by the need for tools for within-family selection. In Atlantic salmon, resistance towards the viral disease infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) was found by two groups to be controlled largely by one QTL. This QTL has been implemented in marker-assisted selection (MAS) by two breeding companies. © CAB International 2011.},

	abstract = {Background: The new ruthenium(II)-arene complex, which bearing a carborane unit, ruthenium and ferrocenyl functional groups, has a novel versatile synthetic chemistry and unique properties of the respective material at the nanoscale level. The ruthenium(II)-arene complex shows significant cytotoxicity to cancer cells and tumor-inhibiting properties. However, ruthenium(II)-arene complex of mechanism of anticancer activity are scarcely explored. Therefore, it is necessary to explore ruthenium(II)-arene complex mechanism of anticancer activity for application in this area.Results: In this study, the ruthenium(II)-arene complex could significantly induce apoptosis in human lung cancer HCC827 cell line. At the concentration range of 5 μM-100 μM, ruthenium(II)-arene complex had obvious cell cytotoxicity effect on HCC827 cells with IC50 values ranging 19.6 ± 5.3 μM. Additionally, our observations demonstrate that the ruthenium(II)-arene complex can readily induce apoptosis in HCC827 cells, as evidenced by Annexin-V-FITC, nuclear fragmentation as well as DNA fragmentation. Treatment of HCC827 cells with the ruthenium(II)-arene complex resulted in dose-dependent cell apoptosis as indicated by high cleaved Caspase-8,9 ratio. Besides ruthenium(II)-arene complex caused a rapid induction of cleaved Caspase-3 activity and stimulated proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in vitro and in vivo.Conclusion: In this study, the ruthenium(II)-arene complex could significantly induce apoptosis in human lung cancer HCC827 cell line.

	abstract = {Vanaraja, a dual-purpose chicken variety needs intensive farm conditions to protect against cold, nutrient deficiencies and to provide immunity during the initial 6 weeks of age before letting them under free range conditions. Therefore, 2 separate experiments were conducted to identify optimum dietary levels of crude protein (CP), sulphur amino acids (SAA) and lysine (Lys) in diets of Vanaraja chicken from 1 to 42 days of age. Diets (9) were prepared with 3 levels of CP ( 1.4.5,16 and 17.5%) and SAA (0.567,0.626 and 0.685%) in a factorial manner and each diet was fed to 8 replicate groups of 6 chicks each in experiment 1. Similarly, 6 diets with 2 levels of CP (1.4.5 and 16%) and 3 levels of Lys (0.66, 0.73 and 0.79%) were prepared and each diet was fed to 12 replicate groups in experiment 2. The interaction between CP and SAA significantly influenced the body weight gain and feed conversion efficiency at 28 days of age. However, weight gain and feed efficiency at 14 and 42 days of age, relative weights of ready to cook yield (RTC), abdominal fat, gizzard, liver, giblet, intestine and lymphoid organs (bursa and spleen), and the antibody titres against sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and CBH response to phytohaemoglutanin-P (PHA-P) inoculation were not affected by the interaction between these 2 nutrients. Antibody production against SRBC was significantly higher in birds fed 17.5% CP compared to lower levels. Abdominal fat content decreased with increase in dietary CP. The interaction between CP and Lys did not influence weight gain, feed efficiency (at 1.4, 28 and 42d of age), RTC yield, abdominal fat, relative weights of gizzard, liver, giblet, bursa and spleen. Relative weight of abdominal fat and giblet decreased with increase in concentration of CP in diet. The relative weights of liver and giblet increased non-linearly with increase in Lys content in diet. Based on the results of both the experiments, it is concluded that Vanaraja chicks do not require more than 14.5% crude protein, 0.567% sulphur amino acids and 0.66% lysine for optimum performance and carcass traits during 1 to 42 days of age.},

	abstract = {The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), is perhaps the most successful invasive mosquito species in contemporary history. In the United States, Ae. albopictus has spread from its introduction point in southern Texas to as far north as New Jersey (i.e., a span of ≈14° latitude). This species experiences seasonal constraints in activity because of cold temperatures in winter in the northern United States, but is active year-round in the south. We performed a laboratory experiment to examine how life-history traits of Ae. albopictus from four populations (New Jersey [39.4° N], Virginia [38.6° N], North Carolina [35.8° N], Florida [27.6\N]) responded to photoperiod conditions that mimic approaching winter in the north (short static daylength, short diminishing daylength) or relatively benign summer conditions in the south (long daylength), at low and high larval densities. Individuals from northern locations were predicted to exhibit reduced development times and to emerge smaller as adults under short daylength, but be larger and take longer to develop under long daylength. Life-history traits of southern populations were predicted to show less plasticity in response to daylength because of low probability of seasonal mortality in those areas. Males and females responded strongly to photoperiod regardless of geographic location, being generally larger but taking longer to develop under the long daylength compared with short day lengths; adults of both sexes were smaller when reared at low larval densities. Adults also differed in mass and development time among locations, although this effect was independent of density and photoperiod in females but interacted with density in males. Differences between male and female mass and development times was greater in the long photoperiod suggesting differences between the sexes in their reaction to different photoperiods. This work suggests that Ae. albopictus exhibits sex-specific phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits matching variation in important environmental variables. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer heterogeneity represents a major hurdle to improve patient survival. Notwithstanding its potential curability due to the availability of treatment modalities that are effective in the presence of favourable clinical or patho-biologic features, there is still a great deal of controversy in its clinical management. In the last decades, tumour biomarkers that are indicative of or related to cell traits characterising malignancy, such as self-sufficiency in proliferative growth signals, insensitivity to growth inhibitory signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, activation of pathways leading to neo-angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, have provided information that have proved to be associated with disease progression. However, when singly analysed, their prognostic relevance was modest, and the only clinically useful biomarkers that remained are cell proliferation and plasminogen activationrelated factors for prognosis, steroid hormone receptors and HER2/neu for prediction of response to hormonal or to the novel targeted anti-HER2/neu therapy, respectively. It therefore remains necessary to reduce the intrinsic complexity of breast cancer in order to improve its clinical outcome. One way to achieve this objective derives directly from the concept that cancer is a genetic disease at the somatic level and from the recent availability of high-throughput post-genomic analytical tools such as gene and protein expression techniques for global gene expression analysis. The knowledge derived from gene expression-profiling studies is impressive and challenges currently used breast cancer classification and existing theories about metastatic progression and breast cancer biology. Several studies employing this technology have been consistent in reproducing a molecular classification for breast cancer in which: (1) oestrogen receptor status and tumour grade are the most important discriminators of gene expression subgroups; (2) tumours can be grouped into at least four subsets according to steroid receptor and HER2/neu status; (3) each subset of tumours has a distinct clinical outcome and may therefore respond differentially to various treatments. Additionally, prognostic gene expression signatures have been proposed that outperform traditional clinical risk classification systems, suggesting the possibility to reduce over-treatment in early breast cancer, notwithstanding that the identification of high-risk patients still needs to be improved. A number of recent studies have been directed to answer different clinical and biological questions. However, despite initial enthusiasm doubts have been raised recently regarding the reliability of gene expression profiling for clinical applications, and the outcome of these novel studies still needs to be validated with the cooperation of different specialists and the integration between all the different skills involved in translational research in oncology. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate the pre-weaning growth of crossbreed types. Fifteen genotypes (F1 and B1) were obtained by crossbreeding in the Animal Research Institute in Konya from 1989 to 1996. These 15 genotypes were classified in 4 appropriate genotype names: Hasmer, Hasak, Hasiv and Linmer. GLM and Tukey's HSD tests were used for statistical analyses. Year, genotype, sex, birth type, and dam's age were introduced into the model as fixed factors and birth weight was introduced as a covariate along with year x genotype interaction. While the effects of year, dam's age, birth type, and sex on birth weight were significant, the effects of genotype and year x genotype interaction were insignificant. The overall birth weight means were 4.29, 4.00 and 3.99 kg (P < 0.001) for 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The differences between the genotypes were not significant, and the values were 3.95-4.19 kg for all genotypes during the 3-year experimental period. The birth weights of lambs from dams aged 3 years or older were higher than those of lambs with 2-year-old dams. The birth weights of ram lambs were higher than those ewe lambs, and single born lambs had higher birth weights than did twin born ones. The lambs were weaned at the age of 75 days. All factors except for dam's age and birth type affected the weaning weight. The weights of lambs at 75 days were 17.5-19.8 kg in 1997, 17.0-20.1 kg in 1998, and 19.5-22.5 kg in 1999, and the differences between genotypes were significant in all 3 years, although the superiority of some genotypes over others varied year by year. The year of weaning weights were significant in all genotypes expect for Hasiv, and the values obtained in 1999 were higher than those from 1997 and 1998. The same results were obtained in daily gains in the suckling period. The daily gains were 176-207 g in 1997, 170-212 g in 1998 and 203-243 g in 1999, and the values for 1999 were higher than those for the 2 previous years. The daily gains were 239, 231, 210, 203, 218, 241 and 243 g for the Hasmer, Hasak, Hasiv, Linmer, Merino, Akkaraman and Awassi breeds, respectively, in 1999 and the values for Hasiv and Linmer were lower than those for the other crossbreed types and the Akkaraman and Awassi breeds. In conclusion, the superiority of 1999 to 1998 and 1997 in terms of growth traits was observed not only in crossbred but also in purebred animals, and this may not be the result of selection but rather of an improvement in environmental factors. In general, the Linmer type exhibited a lower performance. © TUBITAK.},

As well as in its natural range (North America), common ragweed is a threat to human health due to its abundant allergenic pollen release. Most studies have been focused on airborne pollen monitoring, but to date, no data have been available on precise individual plant pollen and seed production related to plant traits growing in natural environment and on their corresponding source of variation. The aim of this study was to evaluate pollen and seed production of common ragweed plants in several populations in France. Seasonal pollen production per plant ranged from 100 million to 3 billion and seed production from 346 to 6,114, depending on plant size and habitat. Common ragweed plants developing in field crops produced more pollens and seeds than those growing in other habitats. Pollen and seed production was closely related to plant volume and biomass, thus providing a means of estimating potential pollen and seed production in given target areas. Such biological data could be integrated into population management strategies or into airborne pollen modelling.},

	abstract = {Three different production systems for autumn born dairy steers, managed more or less intensively, have been investigated. The aim of the production systems were to use a basic diet of grass, either grazed or conserved as silage or hay, combined in various proportions. The animals were slaughtered, aiming for the same degree of fattening, but at three ages. The intensive management aimed at slaughter in January-February at 26-28 months of age after indoor finishing with silage or hay. An "intensive out-of-season" management wished improve at slaughter at 28-30 months of age. Finally an extensive management with finishing at grazing resulted in slaughter in May-June at 30-33 months of age. In three successive factorial experiments, 106 steers of two genotypes, Holstein and Montbéliard were reared to test the effects of the three production systems. The animals were evaluated for productive traits, carcass quality and biochemical characteristics of m. longissimus thoracis and m. rhomboideus thoracis. For both breeds, the "extensive" animals produced heavier carcasses (+ 20 kg between "intensive" and "extensive"; P < 0.002). The carcass conformation evaluated by the EUROP classification did not differ between the production systems. The estimated percentage of adipose tissue of the carcass was significantly lower for the "extensive" steers (P < 0.05). The shear force measured on raw meat was not significantly affected by the production system, but after cooking, the shear force was higher for the extensive management as was the total collagen content. The haeminic iron content was always lowest in the intensive management. The results of these three series of experiments show that it is possible to produce steers with a feeding regime consisting mainly of grass (from 87% to 94% of the dry matter intake) grazed or harvested as hay or silage. To make the best use of the herbage resources of the farm and to limit the purchase of concentrates, the production of autumn born steers slaughtered at 32 months seems to be an attractive production system for dairy farmers. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The traditional concerns about farm animal welfare have centred around the impact of intensive environments and management practices on the animal. This emphasis on the physical environment is changing, however, with greater consideration being given to animal factors and in particular to the selective breeding of farm animals. In this paper we use examples from our own research on dairy cattle and sheep breeding that have made positive and practical contributions towards reducing welfare problems by creating more balanced breeding programmes. In both examples, inclusion of health and fitness traits into breeding indexes can be shown to be more profitable than selecting on production traits alone. In addition, we propose that in principle animal breeding combined with economics research can make a more general contribution towards resolving animal welfare issues, by providing a framework for the quantitative evaluation of the costs and benefits of an animal production system. The advantage of the approaches currently used in multi-trait selection is that they transform all traits (production-based or welfare-based) to a common currency allowing direct comparisons of costs and benefits. Currently the weights applied to traits reflect their economic value to the producer. This approach is likely to underestimate non-economic welfare aspects such as the pain or discomfort associated with lameness, and new approaches are needed to more fully account for these non-economic welfare costs. We therefore propose that consideration is given to the use of approaches such as contingent valuation, which has been widely used in economics to derive values for non-economic activities. The question of who would pay for the addition of these welfare costs to a breeding index remains open, but it would seem most reasonable to treat these as a public good and pay for them as such through appropriate mechanisms. © 2004 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

	abstract = {The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is the most economically valuable pollinator of agricultural crops worldwide. Bees are also crucial in maintaining biodiversity by pollinating numerous plant species whose fertilisation requires an obligatory pollinator. Apis mellifera is a species that has shown great adaptive potential, as it is found almost everywhere in the world and in highly diverse climates. In a context of climate change, the variability of the honey bee's life-history traits as regards temperature and the environment shows that the species possesses such plasticity and genetic variability that this could give rise to the selection of development cycles suited to new environmental conditions. Although we do not know the precise impact of potential environmental changes on honey bees as a result of climate change, there is a large body of data at our disposal indicating that environmental changes have a direct influence on honey bee development. In this article, the authors examine the potential impact of climate change on honey bee behaviour, physiology and distribution, as well as on the evolution of the honey bee's interaction with diseases. Conservation measures will be needed to prevent the loss of this rich genetic diversity of honey bees and to preserve ecotypes that are so valuable for world biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The expansion of Africanized honeybees (AHB) through the Americas has been one of the most spectacular and best-studied invasions by a biotype. African and European honeybees (EHB) hybridize, but with time, tropical and subtropical American environments have become dominated by AHB that exhibit only 20-35% genetic contribution from western European bees, and a predominance of African behavioral and physiological traits. EHB persist in temperate environments. Clines between AHB and EHB exist in ecotones of South and Central America, and are forming in North America. What individual-level genetic, behavioral and physiological traits determine the relative success of the AHB as an invader in the neotropics, and of the EHB in temperate areas? Preference for pollen versus nectar may be an important trait mediating these ecological trade-offs, as preference for pollen enhances nutrient intake and brood production for the AHB in the tropics, while a relative preference for nectar enhances honey stores and winter survival for EHB. AHB exhibit morphological (higher thorax-to-body mass ratios) and physiological (higher thorax-specific metabolic rates) traits that may improve flight capacity, dispersal, mating success and foraging intake. Enhanced winter longevity, linked with higher hemolymph vitellogenin levels, may be a key factor improving winter survival of EHB. Data from South America and distributions of AHB in the southwestern United States suggest that AHB-EHB hybrids will extend 200 km north of regions with a January maximal temperatures of 15-16°C. The formation of biotypic clines between AHB and EHB represents a unique opportunity to examine mechanisms responsible for the range limit of invaders. © The Author 2006.

	abstract = {In 1998, Edward O. Wilson discussed the biological basis of morality, pointed out that the analysis of its material origins should enable us to fashion a wise ethical consensus, and predicted the dawn of science-based moral reasoning. This article testifies that his prediction was right. Morality, being based on altruism and collaboration, evolved as a socially advantageous biological phenomenon aimed at ensuring the survival of our species, which was structured in small groups at high risk of extinction for the 99.5% of its existence. In the last 0.5%, the advent of agriculture resulted in a demographic explosion that impaired human beings' moral discernment, because the socially detrimental consequences of immoral actions, which had been recognised and condemned promptly in small groups consisting of a few tens of members, were diluted among millions of untouched individuals, thereby becoming less easily recognisable. Nowadays, to test the supposed morality of individual actions and government policies, we should use reason or, in doubtful cases, mathematical modelling to determine their predictable effects on the survival of small theoretical communities. Unless we untenably claim that the unlikelihood of extinction of today's immense societies entitles us to overturn the meaning of morality, all actions and policies that would cause the extinction of small communities should be regarded as indisputably immoral. This article also presents some examples of science-based moral arguments showing the immorality of restrictions and bans on research with human embryonic stem cells and demonstrates that the old concept of the "naturalistic fallacy", which philosophers frequently invoke to dismiss any scientific approach to morality, is no longer tenable, because it increasingly emerges to be a proof of what may well be defined the "philosophical fallacy". © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper aims to describe the changes prompted by conversion to organic farming for milk production and fertility of first parity Holstein cows. Data was collected for Dutch organic farms, with a distinction made between long-standing-organic farms, converted organic farms and a reference group of conventional farms. The percentage Holstein blood in the herds, milk production (kg milk, % milk fat, % milk protein), somatic cell scores (SCS), calving interval (CI) and age at first calving (AFC) were described over time. An animal model was used to estimate the effects of conversion on different traits based on data from converted organic farms. Milk production was lower and somatic cell counts were higher on long-standing-organic farms than on conventional and converted organic farms. Interestingly, at pre-organic farms, i.e. before their conversion, the milk production level was already lower than at conventional farms. The estimates from our statistical analysis showed a highly significant decrease in milk yield and protein percentage due to conversion. Also fat content decreased, SCS increased and AFC increased significantly. It can be concluded that the conversion to organic farming is a gradual process over years. Dutch farmers who decided during the late 1990s to convert to organic farming, represented a specific group of farmers distinct from conventional farmers, which was reflected by lower milk yields, milk fat percentage and protein percentage before conversion as compared to conventional farms. During conversion, significant changes in milk production, protein and fat contents and somatic cell scores took place. Age of first calving is an important difference between organic and conventional farming. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ninety-nine Charolais heifers with an average age of 33 months and an average carcass weight of 381 kg were used to study the relationship between rearing practices and eating meat quality traits. Farm surveys were carried out to collect information about heifer rearing before weaning, during the growth period and during the finishing stage. The quality of meat from the M. rectus abdominis excised 24 h post mortem was scored between 0 and 10 by sensory analysis using four descriptors: initial tenderness, overall tenderness (OT), juiciness and flavour intensity. Intramuscular fat content was also measured. Four classes of rearing practices were differentiated by multiple correspondence analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. The class 1 was based on a low feeding level during the growth period and a diet of hay and straw complemented with 8 kg of concentrates in the barn during the finishing period. A medium feeding level during the growth period and a finishing diet of grass at pasture and 6 kg of concentrates defined the class 3. The class 2 was linked to a high feeding level during the growth period and a supply of roughage and 6 kg of concentrates at pasture during the finishing stage. The class 4 was based on a high feeding level during the growth period and a finishing stage in the barn with maize silage and 5 kg of concentrates. There were no differences in meat juiciness and meat flavour intensity among the four practice classes. The classes 2 and 4 produced the tenderest meat (OT score: 5.5/10; p = 0.002), regardless of the finishing stage and the forage given to the animals. These classes were characterized by the highest feeding level, which allowed slaughter at a young age (32 months) resulting in the highest carcass weight (380 kg). The classes 1 and 3 classes were linked to the lowest tenderness (OT score: 4.8; p = 0.002) although the intramuscular fat content was equivalent to the classes 2 and 4 (17.8% in average). The classes 1 and 3 were characterized by a moderate growth period due to a low feeding level and a short finishing stage (108 to 135 days). Indeed, the finishing period did not allow the animals to recover the growth deficit brought about by the growth period. This type of farming practice required slaughter at a more advanced age (35.9 months) for equivalent carcass weights of 389 kg. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the advent of helminth parasite populations that have developed resistance to anthelmintics over the last decade or so, especially in small ruminants, sustainable productivity has been threatened. This workshop on novel approaches to control was held at the 19th International Conference of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP) at New Orleans, LA, USA, during 10-14 August 2003. The workshop was organized and chaired by J.E. Miller and P.J. Waller. Novel or alternative approaches to control have been the focus of research (basic and applied) in many parts of the world. The objective of the workshop was to discuss where we have been and what direction(s) appears to be viable for both the short and long term future. In the long term, all represented regions at the workshop have promulgated programs where breeding for resistance may be the best approach as genes for resistance can be fixed in host populations. However, it does take many years to achieve results and the question of tradeoff concerning alteration of production traits needs further evaluation. Vaccination, especially against Haemonchus contortus, has been a thrust of laboratories in Scotland and Australia where natural "hidden gut" antigens have shown promise, but recombinant products have yet to be developed. In Europe, North and South America, Australia, South Africa and Asia, biocontrol using the nematode-trapping fungus Duddingtonia flagrans has been shown to be effective under experimental conditions, but some field evaluations have been disappointing. Most recently, the FAMACHA system was developed in South Africa. This system is directly and immediately applicable to all regions where H. contortus is a problem. Although not a new or novel approach, copper-oxide wire particles have been revived as a means to control H. contortus. Work being done in Europe, North and South America, South Africa and Australia have shown very encouraging results and can probably be considered the best short term approach available. However, caution needs to be considered in sheep to avoid potential copper toxicity problems. Work in New Zealand, Scotland and the US with forages and feeds containing condensed tannins have shown some limited control. Many laboratories have demonstrated that adequate and balanced nutrition programs are also important to maintain mechanisms that combat infections. Overall, no one approach alone is the answer. Approaches that are integrated, including "smart" use of anthelmintics, are necessary.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic variation is critical to many aspects of biological research. Use of a captive population to address questions concerning the genetics and evolution of dental variation raises the question of how the pattern of phenotypic variation under study compares with that in a wild population of the same species. Differences in the pattern of variation within wild and captive populations may indicate different genetic and non-genetic factors, and also may have implications for how well the captive group can serve as a model for its wild type relatives. We compared dental size measures from two Papio hamadryas populations, one captive and one wild. Lengths and widths of maxillary and mandibular second molars (M2s) were collected from 630 baboons from a captive pedigreed breeding colony housed at the Southwest National Primate Research Center in San Antonio, Texas, and 125 baboons from a wild population culled from a sisal plantation in Kibweze, Kenya. Although the two populations consistently differed with respect to lengths and widths of the M2s, principal components analyses show that the basic pattern to variation in these molar crown traits is remarkably similar in both populations; and linear functions based on these measures cannot reliably discriminate between the two groups. This similarity in the pattern of variation among these dental crown measures in these two groups suggests that analyses to dissect their genetic architecture in captive populations is likely to be highly relevant to dental variation in wild baboons as well. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The ewes were sired by a ram selected for either high daily growth (Growth, G) or increased cross-sectional area of m. Longissimus dorsi (LD) combined with minimal fat thickness above LD (Meat, M). The male offspring (n = 23) from these ewes were studied with regard to production, fibre type, bone parameters and meat quality traits. Maternal nutrient restriction during late gestation caused a reduced birth weight of the offspring, a low growth rate from birth to weaning, yet compensatory growth after weaning. No relation was found between maternal nutrient restriction during late gestation and meat quality in terms of proteolytic potential, myofibrillar fragmentation index or shear force measured in meat from 5 month old lambs. The data do not support the hypothesis of a long-term programming effect of maternal nutrient restriction during late gestation on meat tenderness. However, a long-term effect of maternal nutrient restriction was found for bone growth. Femur weight was significantly reduced in L-lambs and cortical bone density and mean relative wall thickness were significantly increased by maternal nutrient restriction during late gestation, suggesting that only some of the bone parameters evaluated express compensatory growth. The effects of maternal nutrition in late gestation on bone parameters have implications for the robustness of breeding stock. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this review, the authors direct general practitioners' attention to mammalian pathology and especially to breast cancer in men using literature and own biopsy data. The most common pathological process in patients with such complaints is gynecomasty, followed by infiltrative ductular carcinoma, and most often the process is unilateral. Finding out a neoplastic process in the early stages when treatment is more successful is a great diagnostic problem. The study reveals that the period from the manifestation of the first symptoms to seeking medical help is approximately one year. Although mammalian pathology is rare in men, GPs should also perform screening as the gland is accessible for inspection and palpation during a routine examination.},

It was shown that inhibition of total activity of oogenesis due to a decreased number of functioning ovarioles is one of the mechanisms underlying the decreased fertility of l(2)M167DTS /+ females. Analysis of individual fertility of each female confirmed also the role of sterility as a component of fertility of the females. Sterilization was realized due both to full depletion of functioning ovarioles and disturbed mechanism of laying the mature eggs onto a substrate as a result of violation of the feedback blocking normal ovulation, which led to the breakdown of ovarioles and filling of the abdominal cavity with mature oocytes. A significant polymorphism of heterozygous females by their fertility was observed. The intensity of sterilization and mortality of l(2)M167DTS/+ females sharply increased at an elevated temperature (29 degrees C), especially at the pupal stage.},

Self-poisoning occurs in people from a variety of social backgrounds, but is associated with socio-economic deprivation and social fragmentation. Common precipitants include relationship problems, often in the context of depression and alcohol abuse. Analgesics and psychotropic drugs are the substances most frequently involved in self-poisoning in the UK. The risks of repetition of self-harm and of suicide following self-poisoning are substantial. General hospitals should have special self-harm services for clinical management. Psychosocial assessment of patients should include investigation of the events and problems preceding the act, suicidal intent and other motives for the act, psychiatric disorder, personality traits and disorder, family and personal history, psychiatric history, including of self-harm, risk of further self-harm and suicide, and coping resources and support. Aftercare should be arranged according to the patient's needs and risk. There is good evidence that psychological therapy is effective. Prevention of self-poisoning and its consequences should be based on a range of initiatives, including school-based programmes, detection of those at risk in primary care, reduced availability of toxic amounts of therapeutic drugs, and effective aftercare for those who have self-poisoned. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A 2-stage stratified random sampling strategy was used to select localities (7) and farms (45). The study involved an interview with the farmers and regular visits to the farms. The survey identified important farm characteristics including demography, production and management practices. The results describe (a) farm demographics (number of family members, education of farmers, animal caretakers employed, types of herds, herd sizes, breeds, and age categories), (b) farm management practices; management at feeding (type, source, storage of feedstuffs, feeding, water supply and use of feed supplements during the indoor and outdoor periods, and pasture management), management at calving (use of maternity pens, colostrum feeding, and grouping of calves) and management at housing (period of housing, types of buildings, use of bedding, ventilation systems, and building cleanliness), and (c) production traits (breeding methods, dry period, calving rate, milk yield and processes). Some identified practices (period of housing, dairy breeds, dry period, milk yield and calving rate) differ from those in previous reports and others (use of crumbled dung as bedding, rare use of maternity pens, water from streams during the outdoor period, and common use of pastureland) require serious attention in terms of cattle health. The results may be of use in designing strategies to overcome drawbacks that are detrimental to feasible and profitable farming and also in forming bases for future epidemiological studies in Kars.},

	abstract = {Dairy processors are seeking to exploit the natural variation in milk components at the farm level to produce high margin niche products. On-farm segregation of milk within or between herds and enhancement of desired traits are mechanisms to increase supply. A simulation modelling approach was used to investigate the genetic effects of breeding and segregating cows for an illustrative milk attribute, milk fat colour. This trait is valuable to New Zealand seasonal supply dairy farmers. Changes in production and the proportion of cows producing "white" (lighter milk fat colour) milk were predicted for a 20 year period for several selection strategies. Genetic gains relative to the status quo were predicted using sires from a small breeding scheme selecting for milk fat colour and yield. It took 18 years or more of continuous breeding for the whole herd to produce "white" milk, although not necessarily over the whole of the lactation under a pasture-based farming system. Selection on colour reduced yield of other valuable traits relative to the status quo herd. Initial selection of cows, reproduction and management strategies can all speed up progress but add cost. Premiums for segregated milks need to compensate owners for transition costs, production losses (if any) relative to the status quo, and the risk associated with long term change. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {A total of 436 young bulls from fifteen Western European breeds, including beef, dairy and local types from five countries, were studied to assess variability in live weight, live weight gain, body measurements and carcass traits. Animals were logged indoors, and fed a diet based on concentrate and straw offered ad libitum from 9 months of age to slaughter at 15 months of age. The weight, body length, height at withers and pelvis width, of the animals were recorded at 9, 12 and 15 months of age. After slaughter, 15 carcass variables were recorded, including carcass weight, EU classification scores, morphological measurements and dissection data. Data were analysed by GLM, regression and principal component analysis procedures. Significant differences were found between breeds for all variables studied, however, the body size measurements and the carcass traits were more useful to discriminate among cattle breeds, than either live weight or daily gain. With respect to the body size and carcass traits the studied breeds could be grouped as:-Specialized beef breeds, comprising Piemontese, Asturiana de los Valles, Pirenaica, Limousin, South Devon, Charolais and Aberdeen Angus, all of which were characterized by high muscularity, wide pelvis and medium height and a low to medium level of fatness.-Local and dairy breeds, comprising Jersey, Casina, Highland, Holstein and Danish Red, the latter two breeds were tall animals, while the former three breeds were small in size. In general the group was poorly muscled and tended to have a high or medium level of fat.-Intermediate group, Avileña, Marchigiana and Simmental: these breeds were characterized by an intermediate muscle conformation and fatness level and were relatively tall. This study provides a detailed assessment or a wide range of variables in the major breeds, and several minor breeds, that are used in breeding programmes across Europe and elsewhere, and will provide information that will be of use to define breeding strategies to meet the demands of the European beef market. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The research was carried out after the February 2001 lambing season. Rams were introduced to the ewe flock while the lambs were weaning. The sheep's giving birth in August 2001 indicated that they had become pregnant while the lambs were weaning. The fertility rate in the August 2001 birth season was much lower than that in the February 2001 fertility season.

	abstract = {The water withdraw is a management practice frequently used by rice growers in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The water removal aims at enhancing root development, to prevent lodging and to facilitate harvesting. On the other hand, water removal may stress the crop, reducing the number of tillers, decreasing the number of panicles per area and limiting grain yield. This experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of different periods of soil drainage at tillering on the agronomic traits of rice cultivars with contrasting cycles. The experiment was set in Pouso Redondo, SC, during the growing seasons of 2004/2005 and 2005/2006. Four periods of water drainage were tested: no drainage, soil drainage at tillering and re-flooding at 7, 14 and 21 days after soil drainage. Two cultivars were evaluated for each irrigation system: Epagri 106 (short duration) and Epagri 109 (late duration). Grain yield ranged from 7.833 to 9.239kg ha-1 (2004/2005) and from 3.984 to 9.040kg ha-1 (2005/2006). The water management system at tillering did not affect grain yield, yield components and rice milling yield. High pluvial precipitation during the drainage periods prevented drought, mitigating the effects of water management system on rice grain yield. The cultivar differences in growth cycle did not impact their response to the water management system. Soil drainage periods up to 20 days at tillering do not reduce the pre-germinated paddy rice productivity.},

The elucidation of correlated responses during trait selection in genetic improvement programs provides one example of experiments occurring within the commercial livestock industry. This experimentation is largely conducted without scrutiny of its conformity to the Three Rs. Experimentation to improve the management of the livestock industry is consistent with the principle of refinement, and experimentation to increase productivity per unit of livestock is consistent with the principle of reduction; however, experimentation to increase total livestock production conflicts with the principle of replacement. Some approaches regarding the appraisal of the ethics of research involving animals, which could avoid arbitrary boundaries associated with the location or purpose of experimentation, are considered together with the relationship between experimentation and other anthropogenic impacts on animals. © 2006 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

The catalysts for future advances will be sequencing of the bovine genome and development of high-throughput technologies to identify and exploit relevant variation in DNA sequences. The new technologies will allow the selection of animals based on specific genotypes that suit specific applications such as once-daily (OAD) milking or extended lactation. These technologies will also allow exploitation of between-cow variation in milk composition, which is currently hidden by bulking of milk on and between farms. Thus, there are opportunities to produce milk from herds of cows selected for specific milk composition that might be, for example, more suitable for cheese-making or have milkfat with specific properties to enhance human health. Identification of genes and gene polymorphisms associated with improved resistance to specific diseases in cows and other farm species also represents a real opportunity to improve animal health over the coming decade. New levels of genetic regulation have been identified, e.g. microRNA and epigenetics, the impacts of which on the performance of cows and humans are only just beginning to be understood. There is a potential role for veterinarians to provide or be the interface for provision of genetic advice to farmers in much the same way that nutritional advice is currently given. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Bats feature prominently among organisms that occupy the aerosphere as they extensively use this environment for foraging, but also for dispersal, migration, and behavioral interactions. Differential use of the aerosphere is an important factor structuring bat assemblages, with species exhibiting distinct morphological, physiological, and sensory adaptations to different habitat types. This necessitates comprehensive sampling methodologies such as combined ground-level and canopy-level mist netting as well as acoustic monitoring to assess the presence, diversity, and activity of different functional groups of species adequately. Recent technological advances in acoustic detection and in methods of analysis, coupled with the expansion of libraries of echolocation calls for species identification, now allow for the reliable quantification of species numbers and activity of the scarcely known group of aerial insectivorous bats, particularly in species-rich tropical assemblages. We provide a brief, exemplary overview of recent studies on bats conducted in Panamá to demonstrate the necessity of comprehensive sampling methods and application of new technologies in order to adequately depict assemblage composition and responses of bats to structural changes in habitats induced by fragmentation. In addition to acoustic methods, miniaturization of radio transmitters has provided new insights into the patterns of spatial use of the aerosphere by bats and has identified species-specific differences in mobility as one of the important traits that determines bats' reactions to anthropogenic alterations of the landscape. Following the goals of the symposium on aeroecology, we propose new avenues of research for probing the aerosphere. We discuss how integration of a diverse array of remote sensing tools with data on species distribution and species traits, such as mobility and edge-sensitivity, might provide novel opportunities for the development, and application of conservation-oriented monitoring systems. © The Author 2008.

	abstract = {This multidisciplinary study investigates agro-ecological functions (nature conservation, agriculture, environment) and implications of newly created, mown sown and unsown field margin strips installed on ex-arable land to increase biodiversity. From conservational concern, the development of species rich field margin strips was not strongly affected by the installed type of margin strip since species diversity converged over time, whether strips were sown or not. Convergence between unsown and sown margin strips occurred also in terms of species composition: unsown and sown strips became similar over time. Mowing without removal of cuttings significantly reduced species richness, yielded more grassy margin strips and delayed similarity in species composition between sown and unsown margin strips. Species richness on the longer term was not significantly affected by light regime nor by disturbance despite significant temporary effects shortly after the disturbance event. On the contrary vegetation composition in terms of importance of functional groups changed after disturbance: the share of spontaneous species within functional groups increased resulting in higher similarity between the sown and unsown vegetation. Furthermore risk of invasion was highest in the disturbed unsown community on the unshaded side of a tree lane. A positive effect of botanical diversity on insect number and diversity was found. However the effects of botanical diversity on insect number was mediated by light regime. At high light availability differences between plant communities were more pronounced compared to low light availablilty. The abundance of some insect families was dependent on the vegetation composition. Furthermore light availability significantly influenced insect diversity as well as the spatial distribution of families. From agricultural concern, installing margin strips by sowing a species mixture and a mowing regime with removal of cuttings are good practices to diminish the risk of species ingrowth into adjacent crops by creeping roots and rhizomes. Seed dispersal was only problematic one year after the installation of the field margin strips particularly nearby the unsown margin strip and wind-borne seeds were dispersed over limited distances, mainly within 4 m of field margins. Annual herbage yield was not affected by mowing management. DM yield of sown/unsown communities converged over time. Compared to herbage from an intensively managed fertilized grassland, field margin herbage revealed a low feeding value, owing to a low crude protein content, a low digestibility and a high crude fibre content. The unsown community had a higher forage quality than communities sown to bred commercially available grass varieties. Both digestibility and crude protein content decreased over time irrespective of plant community or location. Mid June cuts were more productive than mid September cuts but digestibility and crude protein content was lower. The use of herbage from field margins as hay for horses or as a component in farmland compost are good alternatives. A strong relation was found between the distribution of pest insects and their antagonist families along field margin strips indicating a status of biological equilibrium. From environmental concern, field margin strips buffered boundary vegetation and watercourses against cropped areas loaded with high levels of mineral nitrogen. Margin strips reduced the mineral nitrogen content of the soil in the margin and mineral nitrogen loss during wintermonths. Mineral nitrogen loss was not affected by field margin type but by distance from the field crop. A minimal width of 5 m is necessary to reach an optimal reduction in mineral soil N and N losses.},

	abstract = {The genetic variability in 29 populations of Abies sibirica, three of A. nephrolepis, and seven of A. sachalinensis was studied using SSR markers of chloroplast DNA. Stable amplification and polymorphic products were obtained using primer pairs Pt71936 and Pt30204 (with nine and forteen alleles, respectively) of 10 pairs. Totally, 70 haplotypes were found, 43 in A. sibirica, 49 in A. sachalinensis, and 31 in A. nephrolepis. The highest values of genetic diversity parameters were observed in A. sachalinensis, and the lowest in A. nephrolepis. The Siberian fir differs from Far East species by the uneven multimodal frequency distributions of allele length in both cpSSR loci, which is explained by the presence of few separated from each other dominating haplotypes. This fact indicates that A. sibirica and the Far East species have different demographic histories. In A. sibirica, the proportion of diversity between populations in the total genetic diversity, calculated taking into account the differences between haplotypes (R(ST)) was 8.34% and 4.42% without accounting for haplotypes differences (R(ST) > G(ST), P= 0.01). The pairwise G(ST) correlate significantly with geographic distances between the populations A. sibirica and with genetic distances D calculated from allozyme data. No such correlations were found with the R(ST) parameter. The results of cpSSR variability analysis strongly support the conclusions inferred from allozyme data: several geographic groups of comparatively genetically close populations are identified, which may be explained by the invasion of colonization of the present-day Siberian fir range.},

	abstract = {Macroalgae are a significant component of historic and modern invasions, with association to a wide variety of transport mechanisms. These transport mechanisms pose specific constraints on the ways by which species can be taken up, transported and released into a new environment. Currently operating transport mechanisms for marine macroalgae are either associations with intentional introductions (translocations for aquaculture, aquarium or live seafood trade) or accidental introductions (mainly as hull-fouling). A number of potential management options exist, including the development of international instruments and regional agreements. The development of treatment options for hull fouling, the most significant and poorly managed transport mechanism for macroalgae, is of urgent need. Our current ability to identify which species are likely to invade next is limited. However, an examination of the synergies between species’ functional traits, transport constraints, and recipient community attributes will likely provide possible options in the future. © 2007 by Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {Using shrub snail Bradybaena fruticum Müll (20 populations) as a model, we were the first in Russia and in the world to develop a system of urban ecological genetic monitoring of the gene pool of an invertebrate species. The results of isozyme polymorphism studies in shrub snail populations showed a dramatic (up to 70%) reduction in genetic diversity in small isolates from the urbanized environment as compared to large natural populations. In urban populations, genetic diversity parameters were demonstrated to be lower than in natural ones: the mean heterozygosity per locus was reduced up to 0.08 (0.15-0.20 in natural populations); the mean allele number, to 1.9 (2.7 in natural populations); and the number of polymorphic loci, to four, i.e., 2.2-fold (nine in natural populations). In Moscow district, the number of polymorphic loci also decreased to five in the population subjected to anthropogenic pressure. The changes in the population gene pool (as shown by the number of polymorphic loci) were different in Moscow and Moscow district. The percentage of populations with the number of polymorphic loci as low as four to six was 76.9 in Moscow and 23.1 % in Moscow district. The gene pool quality of 80% of the urban snail populations was estimated as unsatisfactory, and in half of them, as critical. The main reason for these changes seems to be genetic drift accompanied by inbreeding, caused by fragmentation of the range and reduction in the abundance of populations of the species, due to the anthropogenic pressure. The results of the study were employed in the program of the Moscow government for restoring the gene pools of endangered animals species on the preserved territories of the city.},

	abstract = {For world food production, potato is crucial and it is grown at an increasing number of places worldwide. Under these circumstances, breeding of high producing new varieties with sufficient quality traits and (a)biotic stress resistances earns high priority. The classical way of variety breeding is not efficient enough to meet all requirements. Many important traits, an increasing number of which originate from wild species, have to be combined or specific traits have to be added to existing varieties. Modern genomics, including marker assisted selection and genetic modification (GM), is a new potential way to improve the effectiveness of variety breeding. In this contribution, serious attention has been given to a special way of breeding GM-potatoes by using cisgenes instead of transgenes. Transgenes are (partly) originating from other organisms or non-crossable species. They are a new alien gene pool for the plant breeder and it is, therefore, reasonable that new regulations are needed for the introduction and release of them in GM-varieties into the environment in order to avoid potential hazards. Recent developments in plant sciences enabled the production of GM-plants with only cisgenes, which are natural genes from the plant itself or from crossable species, therefore they belong to the existing gene pool of the plant breeder. In this paper the potential of cisgenes for effective potato breeding is discussed and it is strongly argued that cisgenic GM-potatoes should be exempted from the EU Directive 2001/18EC. Cisgenic GM-potatoes can be considered to contain micro-translocations or micro-introgressions without linkage drag which are a great improvement to classical introgression and induced translocation breeding. While on the other hand, classical introgressions and induced translocations are always accompanied with linkage drag in a multiple step approach. © Wageningen Academic Publishers.

	abstract = {The investigation of the neural basis and evolution of language abilities is best pursued as a search for language adaptations rather than as a search for the language faculty. The species uniqueness of language functions is contrasted with the conserved homologies linking human brain structures to anthropoid primate brain structures, and the failure to find species-specific neuroanatomical or genetic correlates of linguistically defined innate features of language (e.g., universal grammar). Comparisons to animal call systems demonstrate minimal anatomical overlap with language systems besides final output nuclei though molos control parallels, the anatomical substrates of gestural behavior, suggesting that language evolution did not proceed by progressive elaboration from nonhuman vocal communication. Although there are no unambiguus gross neuroanatomical dishomologies distinguishing human brains that would suggest a role in language processing, there are clear allometric deviations of quantitative traits, including both gross brain size and deviant scaling of internal structural relationships in human brains, that suggest plausible roles in language processing. Evidence of correlated changes in patterns of axonal connections also implicate the extensive allometric deviations of human brains with language adaptations. One of the most likely correlates of allometrically related connection change related to language evolution involves the existence of direct cortical projections to the nucleus ambiguous (the laryngeal control nucleus of the brainstem), which are likely absent in other mammals. This enables humans to have articulate control over the visceromotor lung and larynx control systems and to couple this with articulate control of the skeletal motor tongue, facial, and jaw muscles. Tracer studies and physiological recording studies of the macaque monkey ventral premotor and prefrontal cortex provide evidence of extensive homology of connectivity, suggesting that the circuits associated with these cortical areas were recruited for language processing during human evolution. Also, cells in adjacent macaque premotor cortex differentially fire with respect to self-initiated and other-initiated grasping behaviors. This suggests that the human homologue to this or nearby areas might be relevant to the mimicry necessary to acquire language. Genetic studies of human language adaptations have identified a gene, FOXP2, that is damaged in an inherited language deficit that affects automatizion of speech and syntactic processes. It turns out to be a highly conserved gene regulating forebrain basal ganglia development in embryogenesis. The human version of the gene contains two unique point mutations, neither of which is implicated in the language disorder. The functional differences produced by these changes are not known, but appear to have spread quickly in the early human population. The homologues to this gene in other species also play roles in vocal behavior. This genetic change is probably only one of a great many that contribute to the adaptation for language. These sources of comparative functional and anatomical information argue against saltationist scenarios that hypothesize a sudden recent appearance of language abilities, and instead suggest that many diverse adaptations converged to make language possible. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA elements that replicate in an autonomous, self-controlled way and that exist with characteristic copy numbers within a host organism [7,10]. They are mostly organized as double-stranded circular DNA molecules with closed strands that can be isolated in the form of supercoiled DNA. Concerning their genetic organization, plasmids contain an essential DNA region, the basic replicon, which comprises the genes and loci involved in autonomous replication and replication control. Additionally, plasmids may encode auxiliary inheritance mechanisms ensuring their stable maintenance and faithful segregation during cell division [18,15]. Plasmids may also carry genes that could be considered dispensable, although they might play an important or beneficial role for the plasmid itself and/or its host organism. Furthermore, plasmids favor the genetic exchange in bacterial populations since they cannot only incorporate, but also deliver additional genetic material by recombination processes or transposition. This so-called gene load may be involved, for instance, in antibiotic or toxic heavy metal resistance or it may confer favorable physiological traits on the host [68]. Since plasmids can be introduced into new host species by a variety of transfer mechanisms, they can be considered to represent an easy, accessible pool of horizontal mobile DNA, which is shared among bacterial populations. Consequently, plasmids play a major role in enhancing the genetic diversity and adaptation of bacteria by transferring their gene load into new host species [31]. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {During the study Relationships of Indoor, Outdoor, and Personal Air (RIOPA*), 48-hour integrated indoor, outdoor, and personal air samples were collected between summer 1999 and spring 2001 in three different areas of the United States: Elizabeth NJ, Houston TX, and Los Angeles County CA. Air samples suitable for analyzing particulate matter 2.5 microm or smaller in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) were collected in 219 homes (twice in 169 homes). Indoor and outdoor air samples suitable for gas-phase and particle-phase organic analyses were collected in 152 homes (twice in 132 homes). Samples or subsets of samples were analyzed for PM2.5 mass, organic functional groups, elements, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), gas-phase and particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and chlordanes. Air exchange rate (AER), temperature, and relative humidity were measured for each residence; questionnaire data and time-activity information were collected from the participants. Median indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 mass concentrations were 14.4, 15.5, and 31.4 microg/m3, respectively. Personal PM2.5 concentrations were significantly higher and more variable than indoor and outdoor concentrations. Several approaches were applied to quantify indoor PM2.5 of ambient (outdoor) and nonambient (indoor) origin, some using PM2.5 mass concentrations and others using PM2.5 species concentrations. PM of outdoor origin was estimated in three ways using increasingly accurate assumptions. Comparing estimates from the three approaches enabled us to quantify several types of errors that may be introduced when central-site PM concentrations are used as surrogate estimates for PM exposure. Estimates made using individual measurements produced broader distributions and higher means than those made using a single infiltration factor for all homes and days. The best estimate (produced by the robust regression approach) of the mean contribution of outdoor PM2.5 to the indoor mass concentration was 73% and to personal exposure was 26%. Possible implications of exposure error for epidemiologic assessments of PM are discussed below. Organic particulate matter was the major constituent of PM2.5 generated indoors. After correcting for artifacts, it constituted 48%, 55%, and 61% of PM2.5 mass inside study homes in Los Angeles, Elizabeth, and Houston, respectively. At least 40% but probably closer to 75% of this organic matter, on average, was emitted or formed indoors. Functional group analysis provided some insights into the composition and properties of the indoor-generated organic PM2.5. Chlordane, a very minor but mutagenic semivolatile organic mixture previously used as a termiticide, was found to be mostly of indoor origin. High emission rates were most frequently found in homes built from 1945 to 1959. Analysis of the change in gas-particle partitioning during transport of outdoor PAHs to indoor environments illustrated that chemical thermodynamics can alter the concentration and composition of outdoor PM as it is transported indoors. (This has been previously noted for nitrate [Lunden et al 2003].) In epidemiologic studies that rely on central-site monitoring data, such transformations may result in measurement error, and this possibility warrants further investigation.},

	abstract = {An efficient animal cloning technology, using the procedure of nuclear transfer (NT), would provide many new opportunities for livestock agriculture, animal conservation and biomedicine. Although it is 10 years since the birth of 'Dolly', the first animal to be cloned from an adult cell, it is still remarkable that NT using differentiated donor cells can produce physiologically normal cloned animals. But the process is very inefficient, poorly understood and appears highly prone to epigenetic errors. With the present technology, only up to 6% of the embryos transferred to the reproductive tracts of recipient females typically result in long-term surviving clones. Not only are there high losses throughout gestation, during birth and in the immediate post-natal period, but also throughout adulthood. Many of the pregnancy losses relate to failure of the placenta to develop and function correctly. Placental dysfunction may also have an adverse influence on postnatal viability and health. These anomalies are probably due to incorrect epigenetic reprogramming of the donor genome following NT, leading to inappropriate patterns of gene expression during the development of clones. While some physiological tests on surviving clones suggest normality, other reports indicate a variety of post-natal clone-associated abnormalities. Importantly, it appears that these clone-associated phenotypes are not transmitted to offspring following sexual reproduction. This indicates that they represent epigenetic errors which are corrected during gametogenesis. While this requires molecular confirmation, it provides initial confidence in the first application of NT in agriculture, namely, the production of small numbers of cloned sires from genetically elite males, for natural mating, to effectively disseminate genetic gain. Considerably more efficient cloning methods will be required for large-scale dissemination of whole genotypes of elite livestock from nucleus herds directly to commercial producers. The continual advances in animal genomics towards the identification of genes that influence livestock production traits and human health serve to increase the ability to genetically modify cultured cells, prior to NT, to generate livestock with increased productivity or that produce superior quality food and biomedical products for niche markets. The potential opportunities for animal agriculture are more challenging because of the greater demands on cost, efficiency, consumer acceptance and relative value of the product to be viable in contrast to biomedical applications. Hence, the integration of this technology into practical farming systems remains some time in the future. © CABI Publishing 2006.},

	abstract = {The spread of an immigrant host species can be influenced both by its specific helminth parasites that come along with it and by newly acquired infections from native fauna. The Siberian chipmunk, Tamias sibiricus Laxmann (Rodentia, Sciuridae), a northeastern Eurasiatic ground nesting Sciurid, has been introduced in France for less than three decades. Thirty individuals were collected from three suburban forests in the Ile-de-France Region between 2002 and 2006. Two intestinal nematode species dominated the helminth fauna: Brevistriata skrjabini [Prevalence, P, 99% C.I., 87% (64-97%); mean intensity, M.I., 99% C.I., 43 (28-78)] and Aonchotheca annulosa [P, 47% (25-69%); M.I., 35 (3-157)]. B. skrjabini is a direct life cycle nematode species of North Eurasiatic origin, with a restricted spectrum of phylogenetically related suitable hosts. This result indicates that B. skrjabini successfully settled and spread with founder pet chipmunks maintained in captivity and released in natura. Chipmunks acquired A. annulosa, a nematode species with a large spectrum of phylogenetically unrelated suitable host species, from local Muroid rodent species with similar behavior, life-history traits and habitats. Quantitative studies are needed to evaluate the potential for both B. skrjabini and A. annulosa to impede the spread of Tamias and for B. skrjabini to favor chipmunk colonization through detrimental effects upon native co-inhabiting host species. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Biochemistry textbooks commonly make it appear that it is a foregone conclusion that the hardware of biological information storage and transfer is confined to nucleotides and amino acids, the letters of the genetic code. However, the remarkable talents of a third class of biomolecules are often overlooked. For example, one of them far surpasses the building blocks of nucleic acids and proteins in terms of theoretical coding capacity by oligomer formation. Although often exclusively assigned to duties in energy metabolism, carbohydrates as part of cellular glycoconjugates (glycoproteins, proteoglycans, glycolipids) have, in fact, other important tasks. Currently, they are increasingly gaining recognition as an operative high-density information coding system. An elaborate enzymatic machinery enables cells to be versatile enough to produce a glycan profile (glycome) that is as characteristic as a fingerprint. Moreover, swift modifications during dynamic processes, such as differentiation or malignant transformation, are readily possible. The translation of the information presented in oligosaccharide determinants to biological responses is carried out by lectins. Recognition of foreign glycosignatures in innate immunity, regulation of cell-cell/matrix interactions, cell migration or growth, and intra- and intercellular glycan routing etc represent physiologically far-reaching lectin-carbohydrate functionality. The classification of endogenous lectins is guided by sequence alignments and conservation of distinct structural traits. For example, a jelly-roll-like folding pattern and maintenance of key residue positioning involved in stacking and C-H/π-interactions as well as directional hydrogen bonds to the β-galactoside ligands are common denominators among galectins. Biochemical and biophysical studies are beginning to unravel the intricacies of the selection of a limited set of endogenous ligands, such as certain integrins or ganglioside GM1, and combined with biological cell experiments, its relevance for cell sociology, e.g. in growth regulation and tumor cell invasion or activated T cell apoptosis. Histopathological monitoring accompanies the biological cell investigations, linking expression of certain family members to tumor progression or suppression. Further insights into the functional consequences of the sugar code's translation are thus expected to have notable repercussions for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.},

Thus the result of present study suggests that small amount (6% dry matter basis) fresh or dry DW can be incorporated for profitable broiler production.},

AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the practical usefulness of WHO classification by correlation of histological subtype of thymoma with staging, symptoms and epidemiology. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 87 cases of thymomas was reclassified according to the WHO Histologic classification and Masaoka staging system. Clinical symptoms, age and sex of the patient were taken into consideration in each case. RESULTS: The histological subtypes was diagnosed in order of frequency: AB (n = 21; 24%), B2 (n = 19; 22%), B1 (n = 14; 16%), A (n = 6; 7%), C (n = 4; 5%), B3 (n = 3; 3%). Combined types was observed in 17 (20%) cases. Tendency to invasion increased as follows: A < AB < B1 < B2 < B3 < C. The median value of patients' age was: type A - 67,5 years, type AB - 62 yrs., type B1 - 48 yrs., type B2 - 52 yrs., type B3 - 32 yrs. and type C (thymic carcinoma) - 49,5 yrs. No correlation was found between histological type and sex of patient. The most often clinical symptom - myasthenia, accompanied predominantly B2 thymomas. CONCLUSIONS: The WHO classification is useful in routine pathologic examination of thymomas, because it enables to distinguish histological subtypes with different clinical representation.},

	abstract = {Background. Although minor facial injuries are relatively common, their psychological impact is an area neglected in the literature. For physiologically major injuries (such as facial cancers, burns and fractures), the face has been suggested to be a psychologically significant area of the body and disfigurement has been found to have numerous potential social consequences for patients. Aims. This paper reports the findings of an inquiry that explored the psychological impact of minor facial injuries and the influence of patient and scar characteristics in relation to self-consciousness and anxiety levels. Method. Data were collected in 2001 in an accident and emergency unit from patients with a visible laceration over 1-5 cm that was treatable in an outpatient setting. The Derriford Appearance Scale (with general and social self-consciousness subscales) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were administered to 63 patients 1 week later; data on 50 patients were also available 6 months after the injury. Results. Larger scar size, living alone and aetiology of injury were significantly related to self-consciousness and anxiety levels, although gender, age, socioeconomic group, location of scar, satisfaction with appearance and number of scars were not. General self-consciousness improved at 6 months but social self-consciousness and anxiety remained the same. Patient factors were not related to changes in general self-consciousness over time. Conclusions. Minor facial scars can have significant psychological impact for some people. Awareness training for health professionals, social skills training for affected patients and a patient information leaflet are recommended.},

	abstract = {Understanding the way prosimian primates age can be helpful in inferring what the 'basal primate mode' of senescence may have been. Even though prosimians are known to be long-lived in captivity, relatively little is known about their reproductive senescence, and even less is known about how prosimians age in their natural habitats. Twenty years of observational data in Madagascar for four Propithecus edwardsi sifaka groups were used to analyze reproductive and behavioral trends of aging in the wild. Techniques using tooth wear were developed to establish ages of wild sifakas and to estimate the onset of their 'dental senescence', a proxy for the onset of decline in the ability to obtain nutrition. Estimated maximum longevity was 32 years for female sifakas. Based on the loss of dental functional morphology, and changes in tooth wear patterns and in chewing efficiency, dental senescence was estimated to set in at approximately 18 years of age. Of the adult females in the study groups, the yearly average of the number of dentally senescent females was 24%. There was no indication of a decline in fertility in the dentally senescent females (aged >18 years) compared to younger adult females (aged 4-18 years). The field data showed, however, that in years when rain was decreased during months of prime lactation, infants of dentally senescent mothers died before weaning. This may be because the nursing mother's worn teeth could not shear leaves and extract moisture, nor nutrition, both essential for successful lactation. Old females showed no clear signs of social disengagement, further suggesting that drought-induced stress plays a direct role in increased infant mortality. These data support earlier findings that prosimian females continue to cycle and give birth until death. The effect of environmental variation on infant survival, however, indicates an incipient age-linked decline in reproductive fitness. Therefore, whereas lemurs represent the condition of no menopause, changes in infant survival may uncover selective factors that have in part led to the evolution of menopause in other primates.

The peak in tick abundance coincided with the host breeding season. Across the year, the most prominent fluctuations in tick abundance occurred in birds that were previously characterized as having high tick prevalence.

	abstract = {Introductions of alien species (populations) acquired a global scale, becoming a major factor of environmental change. Population-genetic and ecological studies of these species promote understanding of evolutionary change and mechanisms of adaptation of the species introduced into a novel environment. This knowledge is of interest also with regard to conservation biology in connection with restoring endangered or extinct populations. The transplanted populations are subject to the founder effect and gene drift, which entails loss of genetic variation, inbreeding depression, and reduction of fitness of the introduced species. However, the decrease in the quantitative variability (additive genetic variance, which is directly affected by selection) prove to be significantly less than the loss in neutral molecular genetic variation. Maintenance of genetic variation at the level providing establishment of the invasive species requires a high number of introduced individuals and multiple introductions from different populations of the species. Introductions are accompanied by hybridization and genetic introgression of the invader with the indigenous species, which augments the variability and viability of the former, but are extremely deleterious to the latter. Adaptive changes of morphological and ecological traits and the formation of the population-genetic structure in the new area occur very rapidly. The allied genetic divergence of the introduced population from the donor one may be directly or indirectly associated with the adaptation processes. Transplantation of anadromous salmonid species among hatcheries undertaken to increase the population numbers (i.e., introductions within the natural range) were of low efficiency owing to conservative local adaptations and low fitness of the transplanted fish. However, sometimes these transplantations were successful, if they involved geographically close populations with common origin and common evolutionary history. Numerous studies yield negative genetic, ecological, and ecosystemic effects of introduction of alien species and populations, which should be taken into account when planning transplantations.},

	abstract = {Viviparity is a defining characteristic of the eutherian or placental mammals. Evolution of this trait required extensive modification of the ovary,1 as well as the uterus and the fetal membranes, which underwent modifications resulting in the establishment of the placenta.2 The mammalian evolutionary pressure toward placental formation resulted in significant variation among the mechanisms of implantation, embryo invasion, and placentation.3 The simplest mechanism, resulting in the least intimate maternal-fetal interaction, is known as epitheliochorial placentation. It comprises apposition and attachment of the embryonic chorion to the endometrial epithelium and is exemplified by the placentation in the pig, with variations in other hoofed mammals. In equids, for example, there is invasion of the specialized trophoblast cells of the chorionic girdle to form the endometrial cups.4 In ruminants, specialized binucleate trophoblast cells invade the epitheliochorial interface and fuse with the endometrial epithelium.4 A closer association of mother and fetus occurs in the endotheliochorial placental subtype, where the trophoblast erodes or bypasses the endometrial epithelium to associate directly with the maternal capillaries.5 This placentation is found in species and groups as diverse as the mustelids, pinnepeds, shrews, squirrels, and elephants.3 The most intimate of interactions, hemochorial placentation, is present when the trophoblast is in contact with maternal blood, following erosion of both the endometrial epithelium and the vascular endothelium. Versions of this subtype are found in primates, rodents, bats, and rabbits, among others.3 Comparative morphological investigations across mammalian taxa have provided some surprises. The presence of trophoblast invasion, erosion of maternal epithelium, and endotheliochorial placentation in insectivores, believed to be the most primitive mammals, suggests that the least invasive subtype, epitheliochorial placentation, is a secondary specialization.3 Moreover, there are variations in invasiveness of trophoblast. © 2008 Informa UK Ltd.},

	abstract = {An efficient animal cloning technology, using the procedure of nuclear transfer (NT), would provide many opportunities for livestock agriculture and biomedicine. Although the birth of 'Dolly', the first animal to be cloned from an adult cell, occurred back in 1996, it is still remarkable that NT using differentiated donor cells can produce physiologically normal cloned animals. But the process is very inefficient, poorly understood and appears highly prone to epigenetic errors resulting in abnormal phenotypes. Importantly, it appears that these deficiencies are not transmitted to offspring following sexual reproduction. This provides initial confidence in the first application of NT in agriculture, namely, the production of small numbers of cloned sires from genetically elite males, for natural mating, to effectively disseminate genetic gain. The continual advances in animal genomics towards the identification of genes that influence livestock production traits and impact on human health serve to increase the ability to genetically modify cultured cells, prior to NT, to generate livestock with increased productivity or that produce superior quality food and biomedical products for niche markets. The potential opportunities for animal agriculture are more challenging because of the greater demands on cost, efficiency, consumer acceptance and relative value of the product for commercial viability in contrast to biomedicine, which is the main driver for this technology platform. None the less, cloning and transgenesis are being used to redesign the genetic make-up of livestock; however, the integration of this technology into practical farming systems remains some time in the future. © CAB International 2007.

	abstract = {Rice qUVR-10, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ultraviolet-B (UVB) resistance on chromosome 10, was cloned by map-based strategy. It was detected in backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from a cross between the japonica variety Nipponbare (UV resistant) and the indica variety Kasalath (UV sensitive). Plants homozygous for the Nipponbare allele at the qUVR-10 locus were more resistant to UVB compared with the Kasalath allele. High-resolution mapping using 1850 F2 plants enabled us to delimit qUVR-10 to a >27-kb genomic region. We identified a gene encoding the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyase in this region. Activity of CPD photorepair in Nipponbare was higher than that of Kasalath and nearly isogenic with qUVR-10 [NIL(qUVR-10)], suggesting that the CPD photolyase of Kasalath was defective. We introduced a genomic fragment containing the CPD photolyase gene of Nipponbare to NIL(qUVR-10). Transgenic plants showed the same level of resistance as Nipponbare did, indicating that the qUVR-10 encoded the CPD photolyase. Comparison of the qUVR-10 sequence in the Nipponbare and Kasalath alleles revealed one probable candidate for the functional nucleotide polymorphism. It was indicated that single-base substitution in the CPD photolyase gene caused the alteration of activity of CPD photorepair and UVB resistance. Furthermore, we were able to develop a UV-hyperresistant plant by overexpression of the photolyase gene. Copyright © 2005 by the Genetics Society of America.},

	abstract = {Standard techniques for assessing plumage damage to hens from feather pecking typically require capture and handling. Handling of individual birds for plumage assessment is relatively easy in experimental studies, however, close inspection of individual birds in commercial flocks is less feasible because catching birds is difficult may compromise bird welfare and affect egg production. The aim of this study was to assess a non-intrusive method for scoring plumage damage in a commercial free-ranging flock of laying hens. Plumage damage was scored within a 2 m distance of the birds, without capture or handling, using a 5-point scale for 5 body regions. The feather scores, recorded at a distance, by two independent scorers were compared (distance scores), and were then compared with feather scores recorded by a scorer who caught and handled the birds to examine the plumage damage closely (capture scores). There was a significant and positive correlation between the distance scores and the capture scores, and the mean correlation coefficient for all plumage score traits was 0.89. There was also a significant and positive correlation between scorers, and the mean correlation coefficient for all plumage score traits was 0.84. The standard deviation of the residual mean difference between scorers and between methods was less than 1 point for individual body regions and less than 1.5 points for the total body score. Large variation in feather damage within a flock and small sample size increased the standard error of the mean total feather score. When feather damage variation within flocks is low (ie little observed feather damage), the current industry standard of scoring a sample of 100 birds is likely to provide a reliable estimate of flock feather damage; however, when there is large variation within birds of a flock (ie considerable observed feather damage) ≥ 200 birds should be inspected to accurately monitor changes in plumage condition. The non-intrusive method of feather scoring described in this paper may be useful for commercial-scale feather pecking studies or for farmers who need to assess the plumage damage of their flocks reliably quickly and with minimal disturbance or stress to the birds. © 2006 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

	abstract = {The improvements in crops yield achieved during the past decades are now limited by water availability (Passioura, 2002), which is considered to be the most challenging environmental stress. The release of cultivars characterized by increased tolerance to drought and other abiotic stresses will largely depend on our ability to tailor crops genomes accordingly. Even though some of its aspects may remain unfamiliar, the genomic approach, when appropriately intersected with other relevant disciplines, will positively impact our understanding of plant metabolism and, eventually, our breeding activities (Miflin, 2000; Tuberosa et al., 2002a; Morandini and Salamini, 2003). Genomics interfaced with crop modelling approaches provides a means to help dissecting G × E interactions and to resolve the hierarchical complexity underlying yield into traits that might be under simpler genetic control (Asseng et al., 2002; Asseng et al., 2003; Reymond et al., 2003; Tardieu, 2003). Essentially, models are constructed as decision-making tools for management but may be of use in detecting prospective traits for selection within a breeding programme. Using sound information on crop physiology and empirical relationships, these models can simulate crops performance, including G × E interactions (Slafer, 2003). Specific models integrating different level of complexity to predict biomass and yield as a function of environmental variables are available (Asseng et al., 2002; Asseng et al., 2003). Such models can integrate information on the genetic basis of yield, which is included in the form of genetic coefficients. In future, it may be possible to incorporate in these models information concerning the action of single QTLs (Reymond et al., 2003; Tardieu, 2003) in order to optimize MAS programmes. Further opportunities for collaboration between modellers and geneticists in ideotype breeding for high crop yield have recently been illustrated (Yin et al., 2003). As to the traits to be dissected through QTL analysis and other molecular approaches in programmes aimed at improving drought tolerance, photosynthetic efficiency (for an example in maize, see Jeanneau et al., 2003) and root architecture are likely to receive greater attention. These traits cannot be easily manipulated through conventional approaches. Other traits may also provide meaningful contributions, should it be possible to devise appropriate screening techniques and if sources of genetic variability suitable for QTL discovery and cloning are available. One example is offered by mycorrhizal colonization, a complex trait whose manipulation may influence water use and nutrient uptake of crops. Although QTLs for mycorrhizal responsiveness have been reported in maize (Kaeppler et al., 2000), limited information is available on the genetic control of the interaction between mycorrhiza and crops roots (Barker et al., 2002). On the molecular side, extensive EST databases and unigene sets derived from cDNA libraries of different tissues and organs, involved in stress tolerance, are excellent sources for building functional maps that in some cases could help in the identification of plausible candidates for QTLs (Bohnert and Cushman, 2000; Ishimaru et al., 2001c). The release of the entire genome sequences of Arabidopsis (Bevan et al., 2001) and rice (Goff et al., 2002) has greatly increased the level of resolution of comparative mapping studies exploiting syntenic relationships. The application of this approach to rice and related cereals has revealed a more complex picture (Goff et al., 2002) than that previously reported through the coarser comparative analysis based on the map position of common RFLP markers (Gale and Devos, 1998). However, accumulating evidence for the abundance of chromosomal rearrangements and the recent demonstration on the lack of microcollinearity among cereals (Sorrells et al., 2003) may discourage the map-based cloning approach for isolation of loci controlling important quantitative traits. From a strictly organizational standpoint, the degree of genome rearrangements that have occurred in different species after diverging from a common ancestor proportionally reduce the possibility for the successful exploitation of synteny among genomes of distantly related species, as is the case with Arabidopsis and cereals (Paterson et al., 1996; Gale and Devos, 1998; Van Buuren et al., 2002; Bowers et al., 2003). Thus, in practical terms, relying extensively on a phylogenetically distant species as a model (e.g., Arabidopsis as a model for cereals) may have, on a case-bycase basis, its own shortcomings both from a genomic and physiological standpoint. The future availability of sequence information for whole genomes will greatly enhance the accuracy of gene/QTL discovery based on LD approaches. When sequencing information is unavailable, haplotype analysis of a set of populations can also provide useful information for QTL discovery (Jansen et al., 2003). Physical maps of contiged genomic clones (e.g., BACs) will allow for the mapping of any sequence, even if no polymorphism is available, thus streamlining the process of building highly saturated maps, an essential prerequisite to positional cloning of QTLs. More importantly, polymorphisms at ORFs will allow us to identify sequence variation with functional relevance at the phenotypic level and to validate candidate genes for tolerance to abiotic stress. Assigning a function to genes and validating their roles will be facilitated by a number of experimental approaches, such as RNA-mediated interference (Cogoni and Macino, 2000), forward and reverse mutagenesis (Maggio et al., 2001), including homologous recombination (Hanin and Paszkowski, 2003) and TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes; Till et al., 2003). Model species other than rice may also play an increasingly important role for the discovery of genes/QTLs that may help in improving tolerance of cereals to abiotic stresses. This may be particularly true with model species like Arabidopsis, which, as compared to cereals, is comparatively easy to phenotype in large numbers. The small size and very short life cycle, the small genome, the availability of the annotated genome sequence, and a vast number of mutants coupled with a very efficient transformation system, all contribute to make Arabidopsis a particularly attractive species for the identification of QTLs and genes regulating the response to abiotic stress. The work carried out in Arabidopsis will be of particular value in elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in the perception of abiotic stress as well as in the signal transduction pathway leading to the activation of the suite of genes involved in the adaptive response to stress. Surprisingly, so far only limited work has been carried out in Arabidopsis to identify QTLs for tolerance to abiotic stresses. Recently, the discovery of a number of genes (e.g., DREB, Jaglo-Ottosen et al., 1998; Kasuga et al., 1999) quickly triggered by abiotic stresses and encoding for transcription factors controlling the expression of drought-responsive genes has sparked great interest for investigating their role in crops. DREB homologues have been identified in maize (van Buuren et al., 2002) and wheat (Vagujfalvi et al., 2003), where a DREB gene has been shown to be a strong candidate for a QTL conferring freezing tolerance. Future efforts to improve tolerance to abiotic stress should emphasize allele mining in a germplasm context broader than that presently explored, which has been mainly limited to elite materials. The exploitation of a wider genetic basis will provide additional opportunities to identify rare alleles capable of improving crop adaptation to harsh environments and increasing their sustainability. In this connection, the utilization of the advanced-backcross QTL analysis (ABQA) approach will be instrumental for identifying valuable QTL alleles in wild accessions and for introgressing such alleles in a reasonably short time into elite germplam Additionally, progenies obtained from subsequent intercrossings of multiparental mating schemes including highly contrasted genotypes will improve our capacity to identify and resolve QTLs. As compared to the biparental crosses that are traditionally deployed for QTL discovery, multiparental mating schemes explore a wider allelic diversity and a larger number of unique recombination events (Li et al., 2001; Korstanje and Paigen; Mott and Flint, 2002), thus providing increased opportunities to unveil at a much finer genetic resolution the presence of a QTL. Although setting up and implementing such multiparental crossing schemes is a costly undertaking, the benefits expected from this approach certainly make this a worthy investment, particularly in a long-term perspective. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

These foods can be considered as delivery systems for health-promoting nutrients. Nutritional improvement of meat and milk can be achieved several ways, preferably by making desirable changes on-farm to directly improve the food without subsequent manipulations. Scope for these changes is limited by animal homeostasis, but alternatives may be less desirable. Methods in vivo that suit typical pastoral farming practice and can complement the solving of animal health and production problems include: selection of traits or phenotypes; specialty diets; long-acting parenteral supplements; and modification of ruminal microflora. Successful techniques to increase the concentration of calcium, selenium, iodine and iron in milk or meat are described. Manipulations to change composition are only one part of bringing tailored foods to market. Commercial realisation of these new products needs the initiative and collaboration of scientists, veterinarians, growers and producers responding to market pull.

	abstract = {Background Redox transition metals have been implicated as crucial players in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Intracellular signaling mechanism(s) responsible for oxidative stress and death in single-cell model exposed to metals has not yet been fully elucidated. The objective of the study was to determine the mechanism by which metals induced apoptosis in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Methods PBL were exposed to 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 μM (Fe2+), (Mn2+), (Cu2+), and (Zn2+)-(SO4). Apoptotic/necrotic morphology was assessed with acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining. Further evaluations comprised production of H2O2, generation of hydroxyl radical (·OH), disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), caspase-3 activation, and activation of NF-κB and p53 transcriptional factors. Results Morphologic analysis showed that 500 μM provoked maximal percentage of apoptosis (22-30% AO/EB) and minimal necrosis (3-7%), whereas low concentrations were innocuous but 1,000 μM induced mainly necrosis (>40% AO/EB). Metals generated both H 2O2 and (·OH) by Fenton reaction. Hydroxyl scavengers protected PBL from metal-induced apoptosis. All metals induced mitochondrial depolarization (17-62% nonfluorescent cells) and activated caspase-3 concomitantly with apoptotic morphology (25-32% AO/EB) at 24 h, and neither NF-κB nor p53 transcription factor showed activation. Conclusions This study provides evidence that redox-active (Fe2+), (Mn 2+), (Cu2+), and (Zn2+) ion-induced apoptosis in PBL by (H2O2)/(·OH) generation, resulting in mitochondria depolarization, caspase-3 activation, and nuclear fragmentation independent of NF-κB and p53 transcription factors activation. Our data highlight the potential use of lymphocytes as a model to screen antioxidant strategies designed to remove H2O2/·OH associated with metal-catalyzed reactions in neurodegenerative disorders. © 2004 IMSS.

	abstract = {Salmonella enterica is a pathogen highly successful in causing a variety of gastrointestinal and systemic diseases in animals and humans. While some serovars of S. enterica are able to infect a broad range of host organisms, other serovars are highly restricted to specific host species. The colonization of hosts by S. enterica depends on the function of a large number of virulence determinants. The molecular analyses of virulence genes demonstrated that most of these loci are clustered within Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPI).SPI1 and SPI2 each encode type III secretion systems (T3SS) that confer main virulence traits of S. enterica, i.e. invasion, enteropathogenesis and intracellular survival and proliferation. Further SPI encode factors that contribute to intracellular survival, different types of adhesins, or effector proteins of the SPI1-T3SS or SPI2-T3SS. The availability of genome sequences of several serovars of S. enterica also revealed serovar-specific SPI. In this review, the main characteristics of the currently known SPI are summarized with focus on their roles in various animal hosts and putative functions in human infections. © 2007 Schlütersche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH & Co.

The economic traits considered in this investigation included first lactation milk yield, first lactation peak yield, first lactation periods, first calving interval, age at second calving, second lactation milk yield, herd life, productive life and life time milk yield. The overall means of FLMY, FLPY, FLP, FCI, ASC, SLMY, HL, PL and LTMY were obtained as 1180.9 kg, 5.17 kg, 314.6 d, 533 d, 1952.8 d, 1241.6 kg, 4126.6 d, 1734.7 d and 7266.7 kg respectively. The effect of sire was significant on all the traits. The heritability estimates of different traits obtained in the present investigation were moderate to very high and were significantly different from zero. Based on the heritability, genetic and phenotypic correlations obtained in the present study, it may be concluded that efforts for enhancing PL and LTMY may be made by early selection based on first lactation milk production traits like FLMY and FLPY.},

	abstract = {The effects of three dietary protein levels on growth, meat, and carcass traits were studied in organic pigs fed a three-phase diet. Assuming lysine was the first limiting amino acid, feeds were formulated to ileal digestible (ID) lysine content, with the ID lysine:crude protein ratio set at a constant of 4%. Feeds were also formulated to an isocaloric rate (net energy: 9.4 MJ/kg during the first feeding phase, 9.25 MJ/kg during the second feeding phase and 9.1 MJ/kg during the finisher phase), with a high (HP), a medium (MP) or a low (LP) protein content ranging from 20% to 14% crude protein (CP). ID lysine content of the LP and MP feed was, respectively, 80% and 90% of the ID lysine content of the HP feed. The nutrient formulation of the HP feed was similar to nutrient levels commonly used in conventional Belgian pig farming. From 20 to 40 kg liveweight, the pigs showed better feed conversion ratios, with an increasing dietary protein concentration (r2 = 0.84). This effect was not observed in the second and third phases, although a significant effect of protein concentration on voluntary feed intake in the second phase did occur (P = 0.018), probably as a compensation for the lower protein concentration in the LP diet. Analysis of the carcasses showed a lower meat percentage with lower protein concentration (P < 0.05), whereas influences on meat quality were limited. It was concluded that whereas during the first phase of growth, higher protein concentration leads to better performance, from the second phase onwards (45 kg), at least with isocaloric diets, a decrease in protein content (corresponding to a 10% reduction in dietary ID lysine levels compared to conventional pig fattening) may be used in organic growing-finishing pig nutrition. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The results confirmed that Lithuanian cattle breeds have the same variants of milk protein systems most common for dairy milk-yielding European cattle. The only exception was the Lithuanian Red cattle breed which had the highest frequency of kappa-CN B allele and beta-LG B allele - both of which are most favorable for milk manufacturing. The alfa s1 -CN allele C, kappa-CN allele B and beta-LG allele B were superior in milk protein content, while alfas1-CN.allele B and kappa-CN allele A were superior in milk yield. Kappa-CN E allele had a positive effect on milk fat. Beta-LG allele B had a positive effect on lower somatic cell count. The identification of kappa-CN and beta-LG genotypes could be an economically important selection criteria for dairy herds designated for industrial milk production.

	abstract = {Traditional battery cages for laying hens will soon be banned in the EU but the increased risk of feather pecking (FP) hampers the adoption of alternative housing systems. FP can cause injury and lead to cannibalism and the painful death of target birds. Current management practices (beak trimming, low light) have associated problems. In a joint European project we sought alternative solutions. In our study of associated traits, birds from a line showing low (LFP) rather than high feather pecking (HFP) exhibited greater sociality (motivation to be near companions) and a passive 'coping' style. High sociality and passivity were also negatively associated with FP in adults. These findings may guide future breeding programs. Trimming hens' feathers to mimic the results of FP elicited pecking and some cannibalism, even by birds that had previously shown no FP. Social transmission of gentle but not severe FP occurred when LFP and HFP birds were housed together. Gentle pecking could conceivably lead to severe FP. We then examined chickens' pecking preferences to guide environmental enrichment strategies. Bunches of string elicited substantially greater interest than other stimuli, including feathers, and white or yellow string was the most attractive. The birds' manipulation of the string resembled preening. Incorporating silver beads or moving the devices reduced pecking. String sustained lengthy interest, reduced FP in HFP birds, and decreased feather damage in caged layers on a commercial farm. String offers effective, affordable and practicable environmental enrichment. The integrated application of appropriate environmental and genetic strategies is likely to attenuate the expression of FP and its harmful consequences. © 2004 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that facilitate or inhibit invasion of exotic seaweeds is crucial in assessing the threat posed by their incursion and to define control options. In this paper, we consider how life history characteristics of the invading species and properties of the recipient environment influence the likelihood of inva-sion, giving particular emphasis to how disturbance influ-ences the establishment, spread and persistence of introduced seaweed populations. Very few commonali-ties in key life history traits emerge since each species possesses a unique set of traits that confers a high capacity for invasiveness. Consequently, for seaweeds at least, predictions of invasibility based on life history char-acters alone are unlikely to be useful. In contrast, it is clear that disturbance is an important process in the establishment of these invasive species. With the pos-sible exception of Caulerpa taxifolia, disturbance appears to be a critical factor that is either a key requirement (e.g., Codium fragile ssp. tomentosoides, Sargassum muticum and Undaria pinnatifida), or which accelerates (e.g., Fucus serratus) establishment and spread. The role of disturbance in the persistence of the invaders is more complex and depends on the species concerned. In sev-eral cases there is substantial evidence for positive feed-back mechanisms that enable introduced species to persist in the absence of the disturbance factor that facil-itated establishment in the first place. These circum-stances define examples of ecological hystereses that pose particular challenges for management and control. The evidence suggests that, in several cases, preventing anthropogenically mediated disturbance to canopies of native seaweeds should be considered as a potential control option to minimise the risk of establishment of exotic species at high densities. However, for these kinds of introduced species, once they are established, control options that primarily target the disturbance are unlikely to represent viable management options. © 2007 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.},

	abstract = {The effects of organic housing and nutrition on growth performance, meat and carcass quality traits were studied in a 2×2 factorial trial with two ways of housing and two types of feed, i.e. conventional housing and feeding practices in Belgium versus housing and feeding according to regulations for organic farming. In both housing types, 32 pigs were kept in eight pens with four pigs per pen. One half of the groups received an organic diet, the other half a conventional diet. Both feeds were isocaloric, neither of them contained antibiotic growth promoters. Three-phase feeding was applied. The conventional feed led to a more rapid growth (P<0.05) during the first phase, due to a better feed conversion rate (P<0.001). This effect disappeared during the second and third phase. Throughout the experiment, the pigs in organic housing showed a markedly higher feed intake (P<0.001). Clear interactions between housing and nutrition could not be demonstrated. The pigs from the organic stable did not differ in carcass lean meat percentage, although they had a higher muscle and back fat thickness. Organic nutrition led to a higher intramuscular fat content (P<0.05), a lower ultimate pH in ham and loin (P=0.02 and <0.001, respectively) and redder meat (P=0.013). The pigs from the organic stable showed a lower ultimate pH in ham and loin (P=0.066 and 0.015, respectively) and redder meat. It was concluded that organic pig fattening does not necessarily affect growth performance negatively, but meat quality traits can be influenced by both organic nutrition and housing type. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Aim and objective. To assess recollection of negative emotional experiences during burn care. Background. Patients in intensive care frequently report negative emotional experiences. Patients with severe burns who are treated in intensive care units undergo painful care procedures, but there have been no recent evaluations of their care experiences. Design. Former burn patients (n = 42) were randomly assigned to three groups: postal questionnaire, telephone interview and face-to-face interview. Methods. Assessments included negative care experiences (feelings of uncertainty, powerlessness, being afraid, insecure, being a nuisance, or neglected), severity of injury, patient satisfaction, personality traits and psychological symptoms. Results. Overall, the degree of recalled negative experiences was low and associated with greater severity of injury, more symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and lower satisfaction with care. The feeling of powerlessness was the most common, as 67% of participants had such feelings to some extent. Conclusions. Overall, negative care experiences were uncommon and most prevalent among the severely injured. Such experiences were also associated with psychological symptoms and lower patient satisfaction. Relevance to clinical practice. Although relatively uncommon, negative emotional care experiences should be monitored more closely during care. © 2008 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Maternal behaviour is becoming increasingly important in animal production. Selection for increased litter size at birth in pigs and sheep puts higher demands on the ability of dams to raise large litters. In pig production, the use of loose housing systems for lactating sows increases the importance of good maternal behaviour. Extensive production systems (e.g., ecological farming and outdoor production), where there is a small degree of supervision of the animals, also leaves a greater responsibility with the mother to care for her young. The environment provided by the dam is important for the survival and growth of the offspring in many species. Several behaviour traits of the mother play a role for the offspring's chances of survival and a good start in life. Examples of such behaviour traits are responsiveness towards signals from the offspring (pigs), aggressive behaviour towards the offspring (pigs and sheep), nursing behaviour (pigs and sheep), and fear behaviour (pigs, sheep, and cattle). Some of these traits are in part genetically controlled, and thus possible to improve by selection. Behaviour traits are, however, often difficult to observe and record on a large scale. By studying behaviour, we can gain further understanding about factors affecting survival of the young, and increase our chances to improve maternal behaviour. Improved maternal behaviour would increase the welfare for both mother and young. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {One of the major determinants for litter size in pigs is prenatal mortality. It occurs most frequently during the first few weeks of gestation and can be attributed to abnormalities in developmental processes during embryogenesis including trophoblastic elongation and blastocyst implantation. Improvement of litter size has been attempted by means of phenotypic selection. However, another promising approach in pursuit of this aim has been the use of genotypic information. Reproductive traits in general are well-suited for application of marker-assisted selection (MAS). The possibility of exerting selection criteria at the molecular level shortens the generation interval as the selection decision can take place early in the life of an animal. Moreover, in consideration of the sex-limited nature of reproductive traits, genotypic information allows for selection in the gender in which the trait cannot be directly observed. Accordingly, there has been considerable interest in mapping and identifying genes involved in the regulation of reproductive traits and in elucidating their expression patterns. This review offers a comprehensive, if not exhaustive, account of the efforts being made and the approaches currently used in this field. One approach has been to choose candidate genes a priori because of the physiological importance of the proteins they encode and their role in the reproduction of other mammals. The usefulness of candidate genes is then examined by association studies between genetic polymorphisms identified in the respective candidate genes and the phenotypic reproductive traits. The other approach discussed uses pre-existing or designed families for linkage analyses in order to map the location of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the reproductive trait of interest. The results reported were not consistent among different studies but the QTL regions detected may be useful for identification of positional candidate genes in further molecular genetic studies. However, a better understanding of porcine reproduction requires that these functional genomic approaches are merged and integrated with detailed analyses of the proteome to establish linkages between predisposition and physiology. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This chapter summarizes the evolution of wood anatomical traits in woody angiosperms and the recognition of ecological preferences from past geological records for a number of arbitrarily defined wood functional types. Xylem evolution can be viewed in the context of a “trade-off” triangle, with different adaptive solutions to the structure/function problems depending on environmental demands as well as phylogenetic constraints (taxonomic history). Evolution of xylem physiology is complicated by the fact that, ever since the early evolution of land plants, xylem has simultaneously performed multiple functions. Regression analysis of various physiological and anatomical characters is used in the chapter to look for trends and possible “trade-offs” between various extant species. The temporal and spatial distribution of the wood types is largely explained by the “tradeoffs” between xylem conductive efficiency and vulnerability to embolism. The two major causes of embolism in plants appear to be freezing and water stress, but the mechanism for embolism formation differs in these two cases. Regression analysis results provide a basis for understanding the variations in the incidences of vessel diameters as related to freezing and drought. However, additional studies are needed to elucidate the physiological significance of variations in vessel wall thickness, vessel perforation type, wood density and parenchyma distribution. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the ecological patterns in xylem anatomy in terms of their functional significance. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Massage therapy promotes psychosocial relaxation and reduce stress. In addition, this therapy has been reported to improve immune function. Although evaluation of psychosocial status has been performed with subjective psychological tests such as State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). subjective psychological tests are of limited value if the subjects fail to report reliably. Salivary biomarkers have been recently suggested as useful objective indicators for assessing psychosocial status. To determine whether salivary biomarkers are useful objective indices for assessing effects of back massage on psychological status in 25 young healthy female volunteers, we measured heart rate and salivary biomarkers (α-amylase, cortisol and chromogranin-A) and assessed STAI score before and after back massage. Back massage significantly reduced heart rate from 73.4+11.8 to 69.8±11.2 and STAI from 41.0±6.0 to 32.3±4.9. In contrast salivary chromogranin-A significantly increased from 2.93±2.21 to 5.29±5.46 pmol/mg protein whilst salivary a -amylase and cortisol did not change. Therefore, salivary biomarkers tested may not indicate changes in psychological relaxation following back massage. Massage therapy has been reported to not only reduce psychosocial stress but also enhance immune functions in cancer patients. In the present study, massage therapy significantly increased chromogranin-A release. As several reports clearly show that chromogranin-A has antibacterial and antifungal activities, back massage may increase host defense with salivary chromogranin-A release against oral microbial invasion.},

	abstract = {Obesity represents one of the most serious global health issues with ∼310 million people presently affected. It develops because of a mismatch between energy intake and expenditure that results from behavior (feeding behavior and time spent active) and physiology (resting metabolism and expenditure when active). Both of these traits are affected by environmental and genetic factors. The dramatic increase in the numbers of obese people in Western societies reflects mostly changing environmental factors and is linked to reduced activity and perhaps also increased food intake. However, in all societies and subpopulations, there are both obese and nonobese subjects. These differences are primarily a consequence of genetic factors as is revealed by the high heritability for body mass index. Most researchers agree that energy balance and, hence, body weight are regulated phenomena. There is some disagreement about exactly how this regulation occurs. However, a common model is the "lipostatic" regulation system, whereby our energy stores generate signals that are compared with targets encoded in the brain, and differences between these drive our food intake levels, activity patterns, and resting and active metabolisms. Considerable advances were made in the last decade in understanding the molecular basis of this lipostatic system. Some obese people have high body weight because they have broken lipostats, but these are a rare minority. This suggests that for the majority of obese people, the lipostat is set at an inappropriately high level. When combined with exposure to an environment where there is ready availability of food at low energy costs to obtain it, obesity develops. The evolutionary background to how such a system might have evolved involves the evolution of social behavior, the harnessing of fire, and the development of weapons that effectively freed humans from the risks of predation. The lipostatic model not only explains why some people become obese whereas others do not, but also allows us to understand why energy-controlled diets do not work. Drug-based solutions to the obesity problem that work with the lipostat, rather than against it, are presently under development and will probably be in regular use within 5-10 y. However, several lines of evidence including genetic mapping studies of quantitative trait loci associated with obesity suggest that our present understanding of the regulatory system is still rudimentary. In particular, we know nothing about how the target body weight in the brain is encoded. As our understanding in this field advances, new drug targets are likely to emerge and allow us to treat this crippling disorder.},

We report on the possible occurrence of Taenia ovis krabbei established in a sylvatic cycle in Patagonia. Hook characters, size, appearance, and location of a cysticercus from a wild red deer are consistent with Taenia ovis ovis or T. o. krabbei. Although it is not possible to differentiate between T. o. ovis and T. o. krabbei on morphological grounds with certainty, several biological characteristics indicate the cysticercus may belong to T. o. krabbei. Red deer have been reported to be refractory to T. o. ovis infection whereas other potential intermediate hosts like cattle, goats, pigs and sheep have been shown to be refractory to T. o. krabbei. Other native ungulates sympatric with red deer in Patagonia include Lama guanicoe and the endangered huemul deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus). Possible or known definitive hosts include native felids like Puma concolor, Felis colocolo, F. guigna and canids like Dusicyon griseus, D. culpaeus, and domestic dogs. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {In the first steps of Salmonella pathogenesis (cell invasion, survival in macrophages) beside the role of several chromosomal virulence gene clusters, an important role is also assigned to the serovar specific plasmids. This paper intends to review these serovar specific virulence plasmids and their genes, based on the available literature and on the authors' own experience. First, it should be known that these large (50-90 kb) virulence plasmids are characteristic only to some serovars (S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis, S. Gallinarum, and S. Dublin), while other serovars (S. Hadar, S. Infantis) may also possess plasmids of similar size but without known virulence genes. The common trait of Salmonella virulence plasmids (psV) is the presence of the "virulence region" encoding spvRABC genes, which may play an important role in the propagation and survival of Salmonella in the parenchymal organs and in the reticuloendothelial system of the host. A further virulence linked group of genes is called "plasmid encoded fimbriae" (pef) operon most likely playing a role in the intestinal adhesion and host specificity. Another gene governs the resistance to complement killing (rck), and is, therefore responsible for bacterial survival in the serum, due to the outer membrane protein encoded by this gene. Finally, antibiotic resistance may occasionally be encoded by genes of psV providing further selection advantage to the bacteria. Due to the wide scale use of live attenuated vaccines against salmonellosis of poultry (and swine), the serovar specific virulence plasmids receives increased attention as undesired components of the vaccine strains. With this in mind, the authors performed experiments on the removal of the virulence plasmid of a S. Enteritidis strain. The first trials using ethidium bromide treatment have failed, but a transposon based elimination system, newly established by them has been successful. Results of the in vitro (cultured cell) and in vivo (day old chick) infection experiments indicated that the virulence traits of the plasmidless mutants of S. Enteritidis and of a S. Typhimurium strain have only been slightly reduced. These results are concordant with the fact that some wide spread Salmonella serovars exist without the virulence plasmid. Based on the literature data and on the experimental results produced here, it can be concluded that the role of serovar specific plasmids should be more cautiously assessed in the future, and this estimation should be strictly related to the tested strain and to the used model system.},

	abstract = {Aim: To compare the effects of four stocking densities (5, 10, 15 or 20 birds per m2) on the performance, carcass characteristics and selected welfare indicators of broiler chickens. Methods: A total of 756 day-old male broiler chicks were assigned as six replicates of 13, 25, 38 and 50 birds per pen, to stocking densities of 2,000, 1,000, 667 and 500 cm2 floor space per bird, respectively. The birds were housed in floor pens in an environmentally controlled room. Normal commercial diets were fed ad libitum and fresh water was freely available throughout the 5-week study period. Liveweights of birds and feed intake were recorded at weekly intervals. Data on carcass parameters and welfare indicators (moisture, gait scores, feather scores, breast and hip lesions, and foot pad and hock burns) were obtained on Day 35. Adrenal glands were removed at slaughter, weighed and examined histologically to determine the total proportion of cortical and medullary tissues. Results: During the study, the birds at the lowest density grew faster (p<0.001−0.01) and consumed more (p<0.001− 0.01) feed than those at the other three stocking densities. The liveweight gains and feed intake of birds reared at densities of 10, 15 and 20 birds per m2 were similar (p=0.11−0.83 and p=0.17−0.57, respectively). Stocking density had no influence on the feed/weight gain, mortality or carcass characteristics. No breast or hip lesions were observed in carcasses from any of the groups. The weight and structure of the adrenal glands were similar across all groups although the staining of medullary tissue of birds was most intense in the highest stocking density group. As stocking density increased, so did moisture and gait score, hock and foot pad burn scores, and the feather score was adversely affected. Conclusions: The data showed that the relationship between stocking density and productivity traits was not linear in nature, in accordance with other studies. Under the conditions of the current study, the performance, mortality and carcass characteristics of broilers grown at densities of 10, 15 and 20 birds per m2 were similar. There were some welfare implications at high population densities as indicated by adverse effects on litter quality, gait scores and the incidence of hock and foot pad burns. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Chaparral species are evergreen and retain metabolically functional leaves throughout the year, requiring uninterrupted supplies of water to remain hydrated. Water stress-induced or freeze-thaw-induced embolism of xylem water conduits represents a permanent loss of hydraulic capacity, as there is no evidence of reversal mechanism in adult shrubs. Assuming that resistance to freezing- or drought-induced injury incurs some cost, one might surmise that leaves should be about equal in susceptibility to injury by water stress and freezing as xylem conduits are to water stress and freezing-caused embolism. In C. crassifolius, stem xylem is more susceptible to water stress than are leaves (whole branchlet dieback with no recovery), whereas in the chaparral shrub Quercus berberidifolia leaves are more susceptible than stem xylem (entire leaf canopy dies in response to severe drought and remains on a shrub until new leaf emergence on stems with winter rains). In R. ovata, stem xylem is more susceptible to freeze-caused dysfunction than leaves; however, in a closely related species, M. laurina, leaves and stems are equally susceptible to freezing injury. Thus the assumption of equal susceptibility to water stress and freezing between leaves and stem xylem does not always hold. Other survival traits may compensate for imbalances in the susceptibility of leaves and stem xylem, such as the high resistance to water loss in leaves of R. ovata that allows leaves to persist in a partially hydrated state until the vascular cambium produces new xylem. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Of the traits that are assessed during physical examination, those most closely correlated with fertility are scrotal circumference and the semen quality parameters of motility and morphology.

Results - The general view on the 3 oriented planes provided good understanding of cross-sectional anatomic features. Likewise, major anatomic structures such as the esophagus, stomach, lungs, intestine (duodenum and colon), liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, heart, bronchi, and vessels could be clearly imaged. It was not possible to recognize the ureters or reproductive tract. Conclusions and clinical relevance - By providing reference information for clinical use, MRI may be valuable for detailed assessment of the internal anatomic structures of loggerhead sea turtles. Drawbacks exist in association with anesthesia and the cost and availability of MRI, but the technique does provide excellent images of most internal organs. Information concerning structures such as the pancreas, ureters, intestinal segments (jejunum and ileum), and the reproductive tract is limited because of inconsistent visualization.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia is a state of reduced oxygenation in tissue and is the most widely studied of all the microenvironmental changes. Regardless of the level of perfusion or status of the vasculature in a tumor, hypoxia induces changes that reflect homeostatic attempts to maintain adequate oxygenation by increasing 02 extraction from blood and by inducing cells to adapt by developing more aggressive survival traits through expression of new proteins. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels and is also an important attribute in a number of physiological processes vital for sustaining cancer cells and promoting tumor growth. It is critical for delivering nutrients for tumor growth and in providing energy to support invasion and metastatic spread. Clinical hypoxia imaging using FMISO and Cu-ATSM are in advanced stages of clinical experience. Optimal characterization of therapeutic targets is essential for the development and clinical evaluation of novel drugs targeting angiogenesis and hypoxia. Hypoxia imaging provides information that is different from that of FDG-PET and should play a pivotal role in oncologic imaging. Among all the hypoxia imaging radiopharmaceuticals, Cu-ATSM images show the best contrast early after injection, but these images are confounded by blood flow. The greatest advantage of PET/CT imaging will be the improved accuracy in localizing hypoxia and making it possible to incorporate these images into radiation treatment planning systems to safely plan and deliver a hypoxia-directed radiotherapy boost using intensity-modulated radiation therapy within the framework of radiobiological rationale. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Helminth infections are one of the major preoccupations in organic sheep farming. The present control strategy is two-fold; aiming to reduce intake of parasites by using proper grazing management or adult parasite load in the lambs. Uninfected pastures (following grazing, pasture newly sown or grazed previously by cattle) are often available and should be dedicated to lambs, which are more susceptible than ewes. The grazing of certain leguminous forages and herbs may reduce parasitic infestation in sheep but further studies are required prior to large-scale utilization in organic farms. The recommended treatments of lambs and/or ewes are based on phytotherapy and homeopathy. At present, claims of efficacy are not backed with hard facts, although the approaches are widely used in organic sheep farms. Shepherds also rely on synthetic chemical drugs, since several anthelmintic drenches are compatible with organic production. The use of different categories of products may prove costly in poorly managed farms. A targeted selective treatment (e.g. selection of animals or groups to be treated) is a proposal that will attract organic farmers, provided that they are given indicators for treatment decisions. At present, several indicators are available (laboratory analyses, pathophysiological indicators (anaemia or diarrhoea), and production traits (weight gains)) but they are costly or time-consuming and there is a need for their optimization. Their acceptance by farmers is also a prerequisite for their promotion. © CABI Publishing 2007.},

These "indirect-acting" mutagens were present in the same 2 reduced extracts that contained detectable concentrations of aromatic amines. These results suggest that a major portion of the total mutagenic activity in air-pollution particles is contributed by nitro-substituted compounds that are detectable as their corresponding amines.

In the present study, HMW-kininogen was highly purified from human plasma by monitoring its clot-promoting activity, using Fitzgerald trait plasma as a substrate. This preparation of HMW-kininogen revealed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (mol wt: 120,000) and released 1% of its weight as bradykinin upon incubation with plasma kallikrein. HMW-kininogen specifically repaired impaired surface-mediated plasma reactions of Fitzgerald trait plasma, but did not affect those of Hageman trait and Fletcher trait plasma. Kinin release from HMW-kinnogen by trypsin, but not by plasma kallikrein, resulted in total loss of clot promoting activity. No inhibitors of coagulation were found when all kinin activity was removed from HMW-kininogen by trypsin. The roles of HMW-kininogen, Hageman factor (HF, Factor XII), plasma prekallikrein (Fletcher factor), and plasma thromboplastin antecedent (PTA, Factor XI) in blood coagulation were studied in a purified system. HMW-kininogen was absolutely required for activation of PTA by HF and ellagic acid. The yield of activated PTA was proportional to the amount of HF, HMW-kininogen, and PTA in the mixtures, suggesting that, to activate PTA, these three proteins might form a complex in the presence of ellagic acid. No fragmentation of HF was found under these conditions. In contrast to HF, HF-fragments (mol wt: 30,000) activated PTA in the absence of HMW-kininogen and ellagic acid. Thus, it appears that in the present study PTA was activated in two distinct ways. Which pathway is the major one in whole plasma remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {We used fibrosarcoma from an H2-K/v-jun transgenic mouse to derive a series of three immortal cell lines (JUN-1, -2, and -3). The cell lines exhibit strikingly different behavior regarding phenotype transformation. Features examined include contact inhibition and density limitation of growth, proliferation, invasiveness, motility, and organization of the microfilament system. Overall, JUN-2 and JUN-3 represent extreme phenotypes, with JUN-2 having a phenotype indicative of low-level cellular transformation and JUN-3 meeting all the criteria of the transformed phenotype. JUN-1 cells can also be regarded as transformed, but to a lesser extent than JUN-3. Their phenotype is in the majority of characteristics intermediary between JUN-2 and JUN-3. The transformation status is inversely related to the expression of the v-jun transgene, which is the highest in JUN-2, lower in JUN-1 and very low in JUN-3. This might be related to the MHC class I promoter driving its expression and to the general observation of repression of MHC class I genes coupled with cellular transformation. Based on this premise, we present a model of H2-K/v-jun-mediated tumorigenesis, in which v-jun-conditioned transformation represents merely an initial phase of tumorigenesis. Later during tumor progression, additional oncogenes are activated and/or tumor suppressor genes inactivated, leading on the one hand to further exacerbation of the transformed phenotype, and on the other hand to the repression of the H2-K/v-jun transgene (fixed in JUN-3). We believe that the system of JUN cell lines can be valuable for further molecular analysis of transformation-related traits. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

	abstract = {Salmonella serotype Typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes a systemic infection in naturally, or experimentally, infected mice. After oral contamination, Typhimurium colonizes the ileal mucosa and Peyer's patches and invades draining mesenteric lymph nodes. From these primary sites of infection, bacteria dissiminate to the reticuloendothelial system and proliferate rapidly in spleen and liver. Several virulence factors are encoded by chromosomal genes. The ability of Typhimurium to adhere to and invade epithelial cells has been associated with flagella, pili of type I and mannose-resistant haemagglutinating activity. By comparing the virulence of isogenic strains, it appeared that these traits played a marginal role and were not essential for full virulence expression. It is now clear that other surface structures are important for the invasiness capacity of Typhimurium. To multiply in the reticuloendothelial system, a complete lipopolysaccharide is necessary for the bacteria in resisting serum bactericidal activity and producing tissue damage. Salmonella have evolved a specialized iron-binding ligand, termed enterobactin, to acquire iron necessary for their multiplication. Enterobactin competes with the host iron-binding proteins (transferrin or lactoferrin) to secure the iron required by the bacteria. Though the presence of an enterotoxin in Salmonella is still controversial, there is now substantial evidence to support this concept. Recently, a gene encoding an enterotoxin has been cloned from Typhimurium and expressed in E. coli. Typhimurium strains harbour a 90 kilobases (kb) plasmid which is essential for virulence. This plasmid encodes virulence factors required for replication of Salmonella in liver and spleen. It was postulated that the plasmid allowed Typhimurium to multiply in Kupffer cells and in splenic macrophages. The virulence-associated region of the plasmid restored full virulence to plasmidless strains. Transposon insertion mutagenesis demonstrated the existence of two DNA sequences, designated Vir A and Vir B, which are essential for virulence expression. The Vir A region has been sequenced; it encodes four polypeptides with apparent molecular mass of 27,000, 28,000, 33,000 and 70,000. The Vir B region encodes two polypeptides of 38,000 and 43,000. In an attempt to identify bacterial components contributing to invasion of HeLa cells by Salmonella serovar Typhi, we cloned a 30 kb DNA sequence necessary for entry of bacteria into epithelial cells. However, this sequence is not sufficient for conferring an invasive phenotype to E. coli strains. From this DNA fragment, a short segment of 487 bp was subcloned, sequenced and used as probe to detect Salmonella.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {The present study is unique in the Malaysian context on two counts; first, it employs for the first time a functional group approach (groups based on occupational or economic activity) in the assessment of community nutritional status. Second, the study provides on a nationwide-sampling basis, information on total blood cholesterol (TC) levels in rural children (7.0-12.9 years; n = 1921) and adolescents (13.0-17.9 years; n = 753) which were hitherto unavailable. Total blood cholesterol measurements were performed on 7184 subjects ranging from 7 to 75-years-old (males = 3151; females = 4033) from households in 69 rural villages and seven estates in peninsular Malaysia, which were based on selected multistage random sampling according to the household's involvement in the following economic activities: rice farming, rubber smallholding, coconut smallholding, fishing and employment in estates. In all functional groups, TC values increased with age and there was a distinct gender effect, namely females had higher TC values than males throughout the age spectrum analyzed. Mean TC levels for children and adolescents were in the range 3.85-4.37 mmol/L, rising markedly during adulthood to an overall mean of 4.91 ± 1.13 mmol/L for men and 5.17 ± 1.11 mmol/L for women. In adults (≥ 18.0 years), there was marked disparity in mean TC values among the functional groups; males and females from rice households had the lowest mean TC values (4.58 and 4.99 mmol/L, respectively). Individuals at 'high risk' (TC > 6.20 mmol/L) averaged 16.0% in women and 11.6% in men, with women from the fishing, rubber and coconut households particularly affected (17.1-21.1%). When compared to earlier rural TC data reported for closely similar rural communities in the peninsula, the present findings suggest a 'hypercholesterolemic shift' approximating 0.39 mmol/L (15 mg/dL) in the adult population; however, this was not apparent in the children and adolescents from these rural communities.},

	abstract = {The egg quality problems are divided into three classes: egg composition and nutritive value; traits of quality depending on specific uses of eggs; and egg characteristics governing the consumers' acceptability. The studies relative to egg composition and nutritive value are described according to three principal axes which are the effects of laying hens feeding and breeding and those of egg storage before consumption. The effects of age of laying hens and of some breeding practices are then recalled; it is well known that egg weight increases during the laying period with a larger part for the albumen. On the contrary, the type of breeding (battery vs. free range) do not seem to modify gross egg composition. The problem of pesticides contamination is more alarming. Egg storage before consumption is accompanied by transfers of some constituents from the albumen to the yolk (water, calcium, magnesium) and in the opposite direction (amino-acids and iron). At the same time enzymatic activities can be reduced while vitamins appear to be relatively well protected. The problem of egg shell strength (governing accidental egg breaking) is probably the most important one during egg commercialisation and usage. Eggshell formation has been shown to induce a perturbation in acid-base balance of the bird; renal and pulmonary functions are then involved in its control. Calcium metabolism presents some original traits in the laying hen because this animal is able to recognize the calcium source among the other nutrients of the diet and digestive phenomena seem to be temporarily adapted to egg shell secretion. Physical proporties of egg albumen (gel thickness) are also an important trait for the domestic preparation of eggs.},

In the SW sows the heaviest piglets were weaned at about 3 weeks, leaving 6 piglets with the sow to be weaned at 4 weeks of age. SW and parity affected the WOI; the WOI was reduced in SW sows and in second parity sows. Body weight loss and reduction in backfat may explain the effects on WOI as found. Second parity SW sows showed a higher farrowing rate compared with second parity C and first parity sows. No effect of SW on the size of the next litter was found. The growth of piglets during the fourth week of lactation was higher in piglets of the SW sows. Piglet growth during a six week rearing period was worse in SW piglets weaned at three weeks. However, when reared up to the same age, the growth of these piglets was comparable with that of piglets weaned at four weeks.

The third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III) of mental illnesses published by the American Psychiatric Society gave a definition of post-traumatic stress disorder which was amended in 1987 in the revised edition of the same manual. The same definition has been accepted by the International Classification of Diseases and Causes of Death (ICD-10). The disorder is observed in 30-80% of the survivors of catastrophic events, in 18-54% of the war veterans, in 17-67% of the prisoners of war, and the prevalence in the course of life is 9.2%. The symptoms include reliving the experience of the traumatic event, avoidance of stimuli related to the trauma, generally dulled reactions and a lack of alertness. PTSD etiology comprises the following: stressor (strength, duration and circumstances of occurrence), personality (age, personality traits, previous experience, genetic predisposition, and available social support) and organic factors (effects of autonomic nervous system and neurobiological changes in the brain). The etiology of the understanding of the disorder is supported by the psychoanalytical theories (primary and secondary gain, anxiety neurosis and conflict neurosis) together with the behavioural cognitive theories based on conditioning and the theory of learning.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Forced selection for high daily gains and meatiness induced biological maladaptations of genetical-hormonal origin. They manifest themselves not only by well-known myopathies and predispositions to stress, but also in the so-called leg weakness of pigs, in dyschondroplasias of broilers; similar "correlated" effects are observed even in dogs and laboratory animals. As far as bones, cartilages and joints are concerned by these deficiencies in mineralization and synthesis of fibrous structures, the terms "osteochondrosis" or "osteochondropathies" were introduced recently. Manifestations and severeness of this phenomenon--induced by antagonistic selection criteria--species not always directly comparable from species to species or even from breed to breed within species. This variability can be interpreted as an indication for the compound effects of heredity and environment. Even in pure breeds like German landrace and Piétrain and even under identical rearing and fattening conditions a significant individuality was found with respect to utilization of minerals; this is documented by different biomechanical strength and mineralization of bones and cartilaginous structures in these animals and by estimates of heritability for these traits, which range slightly higher than those estimated for "leg weakness". Selective measures, therefore, against the antagonisms mentioned could be feasible. On the other hand these investigations revealed that at least in some contingents of domestic animals a biological borderline was trespassed when selecting rigorously for a few economically important traits.},

Chemolitho-autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are responsible for the rate-limiting step of nitrification in a wide variety of environments, making them important in the global cycling of nitrogen. These organisms are unique in their ability to use the conversion of ammonia to nitrite as their sole energy source. Because of the importance of this functional group of bacteria, understanding of their ecology and physiology has become a subject of intense research over recent years. The monophyletic nature of these bacteria in terrestrial environments has facilitated molecular biological approaches in studying their ecology, and progress in this field has been rapid. The ammonia-oxidizing bacteria of the β-subclass Proteobacteria have become somewhat of a model system within molecular microbial ecology, and this chapter reviews recent progress in our knowledge of their distribution, diversity, and ecology.},

It was hypothesized that survivors who were well-adjusted psychologically would possess specific personality traits that would differentiate them from their poorly adjusted peers. Thirty-two subjects were given a standardized assessment of psychologic adjustment and a standardized personality inventory. The subjects were assigned to either a “poorly adjusted” group or a “well-adjusted” group, on the basis of each subject’s score on a standardized measure of adjustment. There were no significant differences between the two groups in variables of gender, age, time since burn, or age at time of burn injury. The results indicate three personality traits that seem to be related to psychologic adjustment after a severe burn injury in pediatric patients. © 1993 by Burn Science Publisbers, Inc.},

Forty-nine registered nurse working in 7 special care units completed the Tedium Burnout Scale, the Nursing Stress Scale, and the Hardiness Test. Results indicate that burnout, stress, and hardiness had a significant relationship (P < .001). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated that hardiness alone accounted for 35% of burnout variance (P < .05) and that the addition of stress had no effect. A previous study reported that burn unit nurses had the least burnout and greatest hardiness. However, in this study, nurses from the Burn Intensive Care Unit had the highest burnout and stress scores and the lowest hardiness scores of nurses from the 7 units. This study confirms findings by a previous study that hardiness is a predictor of burnout but is not a buffer in the stress-burnout relationship. To further understand burnout and hardiness, longitudinal and multisite studies that include burn units are recommended.},

Following Chironomus, the second most frequent and abundant genus was Cricotopus, whose distribution could not be related to pollution levels.

	abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, tick infestation and tick-borne infections together with tsetse-transmitted trypanosomosis arguably constitute the main parasitological disease complex constraining livestock production. Resistance to tick attack and tick-borne micro-organisms (TBMs) varies among different breeds of cattle. The magnitude of losses due to these parasites is related to an extent to the degree of breed resistance. Generally, zebu (Bos indicus) cattle possess a higher resistance to ticks and TBMs than European (Bos taurus) cattle. The host's immune system would appear to be the single most important factor that regulates this resistance. This paper reports on the main effector immune mechanisms governing resistance against ticks and TBMs. The cellular immune response appears more effective and stable than humoral immunity in modulating resistance to ticks and TBMs. Similarities between the immune mechanisms employed by trypanotolerant N'Dama (B. taurus) cattle, when infected with trypanosomes, and those elicited by tick bites and TBMs seem to exist, particularly at the skin level in the early phases of parasitic invasion. Moreover, there is evidence that in the N'Dama breed, resistance against ticks per se also has a genetic basis. Therefore, the N'Dama appears to be a unique breed in that it exhibits resistance to several parasitic diseases and/or infections, including helminths, when compared to other cattle breeds in West Africa. It is concluded that the multi-parasite resistant traits of the N'Dama breed should be exploited in those areas where trypanosomosis, ticks and tick-borne diseases constrain animal production. This should be of benefit for low-input farming systems where the use of chemicals for prophylaxis and therapy is limited by their relatively high cost. Additionally, the potential contribution of multiple disease resistant N'Dama cattle should be considered in crossbreeding programmes with exotic dairy breeds for increasing milk production in West Africa.

	abstract = {The chlorinated dibenzo p dioxins and dibenzofurans are formed as trace contaminants during the synthesis of a number of commercially important chemicals. The prototype compound of this group, 2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo p dioxin (TCDD), is one of the most potent low molecular weight toxins and teratogens known, and its inadvertent dispersion in the environment has caused concern about the potential hazard to human health. In studying the biochemical effects of TCDD, it was found to be extraordinarily potent as an inducer of two hepatic enzymes: δ aminolevulinic acid synthetase, the initial and rate limiting enzyme in heme synthesis, and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, a cytochrome P 450 mediated microsomal monooxygenase. Among a series of halogenated dibenzo p dioxins there is an excellent correlation between their toxic potency and their potency as inducers of these two enzymes. The administration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g. 3 methylcholanthrene (MC)) to certain inbred strains of mice induces aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase while other inbred strains fail to respond; and the trait of aryl hydrocarbon responsiveness is inherited as an autosomal dominant. TCDD, about 30,000 times as potent as MC, induces all strains whether responsive or nonresponsive to MC; however, the responsive strains are more sensitive (ED50 ∞ 1 x 10-9 mole/kg) to TCDD than are the nonresponsive strains (ED50 ≥ 1 x 10-8 mole/kg). The results suggest that the mutation in the strains results strainsresults in a ligand binding site (an induction receptor) that has a diminished affinity for MC and TCDD. The correlation among the halogenated dibenzo p dioxins, between their potency as toxins and their potency as inducers of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, is discussed in relationship to various proposed mechanisms of toxicity.},

	abstract = {Organic farming which experienced a constant rise over the last two decades is a system based on sustainability and on a concept tending towards functional integrity. Legislation as well as the wish to produce separately from conventional farming raise the question whether organic farming should be conducted completely apart from conventional farming or not. This paper discusses the aspects that affect animal breeding under these circumstances, e.g., maintaining genetic diversity by using local breeds and possible G X E interactions which might occur when breeds adapted to conventional farming systems are used in organic farming. Ways of modelling G X E are presented, moreover examples of G X E in dairy cattle, swine, and poultry are given. Trends in selection index theory - designing multi-trait breeding goals including functional traits on one hand, and developing methods for using customised selection indices on the other hand - support breeding work for organic farming systems. It is concluded that before the technical issues can be addressed, all parties involved, farmers, consumers as well as legislators, have to agree on the socio-cultural conditions under which organic farming should be conducted. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The body of a young suicide could be identified by means of one intraoral radiograph taken prior to one extraction, the only treatment listed in his dental record (Fig. 3). 4. After a fire, an unmarked rubber denture was found among debris; it showed burning along the distal palatal edge, so could not have been in the mouth of the owner during the fire. Being so completely deformed, it had to be discarded as evidence. 5. Another denture, removed from the mouth of a victim of the same fire, showed typical burning of the frontal parts, but also a stripe of burning along the midline (Fig. 4); accordingly, this victim must have inhaled flames before he died. 6. An old woman disappeared; in her home, police found an unmarked full lower denture left behind on her bed. When recovered dead several months later, this woman carried a full upper denture but no lower. Dental experts were not involved in this case but later saw both dentures; they had been made at different times and occluded badly. Did this woman have two sets? Or did the lower denture maybe originate from her murderer? The author urges that the FDI design an international system of denture marking. 7. A man was found murdered with an axe; police experts had reason to believe that he might have been executed somewhere else, but tooth 12 (Fig. 6)---found lying loose under the head---showed marks which proved that it had been exarticulated by one of the axe blows (Fig. 5). Consequently, the recovery site was also the execution site.},

Incorporation of lactation at third step along with PI6 and peak yield did not further improve the determination significantly except for first lactation length in BFH and FJH and second lactation in FH and FJH genetic groups. In these 4 cases lactation length had highest determination at first step of regression, increasing significantly with incorporation of PI6 and peak yield at second and third step of regression. The contribution of several other measures of persistency by inclusion at second or third step of regression along with lactation length and peak yield resulted to total determination ranging from 27.03 to 34.81% and thus may not be regarded as good fit.

	abstract = {The invasive phenotype, characteristic of malignancy, is found in multiple transformed populations with widely varying genotypes. The authors hypothesize that this genetic heterogeneity and instability precludes mechanisms of tumour invasion requiring consistent, coordinated production of one or more proteins or other macromolecules. Instead, this model assumes that the genetically disordered, unstable populations found in tumours must employ a simple mechanism of invasion that arises from one common trait of all transformed cells - reversion to a phenotype more primitive (less differentiated) than the tissue of origin. Specifically, this approach focuses on primitive metabolic pathways with preferential use of glycolysis for energy-production. Mathematical models of invasive cancer based on tumour-induced acidification of the microenvironment are presented. Using population ecology and diffusion-reaction models, it is shown that normal tissue adjacent to the tumour edge is subjected to an extracellular pH that is significantly lower than normal. This leads to degradation of the interstitial matrix, loss of intercellular gap junctions and cell necrosis. Tumour cells have an optimal extracellular pH less than that of normal cells and are thus able to thrive in the acidic microenvironment expanding into the space of the dying normal tissue. The model is consistent with extant data on the tumour microenvironment as well as clinical data relating increasing tumour invasiveness with elevated glucose utilization and lactate content. It predicts well-established phenomena in tumorigenesis such as the adenoma-carcinoma sequence and the critical role of angiogenesis in the invasive phenotype. An acellular gap at the tumour-host interface is also predicted and can be demonstrated in pathologic specimens. Novel treatment approaches based on this model are discussed.},

	abstract = {Background: The measured values of specific traits of occlusion may be subject to significant change due to growth and maturation of the dentofacial structures. Some traits may show improvement while others may show deterioration. Rarely is there an opportunity to examine a sample of occlusions 25 years after the acquisition of the original set of records. This study examines the changes in traits of occlusion in a sample of 46 subjects who were originally examined between 1971-1973 and for whom records were again obtained in 1998. Methods: The 46 patients were a sub-group of a previously selected randomised school-based sample and study models obtained in 1971-1973 were still available. New models for each patient were obtained in 1998. Of the 46 subjects, only eight had received orthodontic treatment. Results: Assessments of the changes in specific traits were made using the methods proposed in the Harry L Draker, California Modification (HLD Cal Mod) index. This simple index was chosen because the main component traits were well defined and, when analysed separately, reflected changes with time. The total index score gave a broad indication of the global changes in the individual's occlusion. The five basic traits of the HLD index include overjet, overbite, openbite, mandibular protrusion and labio-lingual spread. Three additional traits (ectopic eruption, anterior crowding and posterior cross bite) are used in the HLD Cal Mod index. These traits provided a useful reflection of occlusal changes with time. Measurements were made with reference to specifications and the details outlined in the HLD Cal Mod protocol. The results revealed an increase in total index scores over time with a significant increase in lower labio-lingual spread associated with an increased score in anterior crowding. Overjet and overbite, however, displayed a significant decrease with time. Conclusions: These findings are in keeping with previous studies and highlight the importance of time as a significant issue in the assessment of occlusion.},

	abstract = {Most gerontologists believe aging did not evolve, is accidental, and is unrelated to development. The opposite viewpoint is most likely correct. Genetic drift occurs in finite populations and leads to homozygosity in multiple-alleled traits. Episodic selection events will alter random drift towards homozygosity in alleles that increase fitness with respect to the selection event. Aging increases population turnover, which accelerates the benefit of genetic drift. This advantage of aging led to the evolution of aging systems (ASs). Periodic predation was the most prevalent episodic selection pressure in evolution. Effective defenses to predation that allow exceptionally long lifespans to evolve are shells, extreme intelligence, isolation, and flight. Without episodic predation, aging provides no advantage and aging systems will be deactivated to increase reproductive potential in unrestricted environments. The periodic advantage of aging red to the periodic evolution of aging systems. Newer aging systems co-opted and added to prior aging systems. Aging organisms should have one dominant, aging system that co-opts vestiges of earlier-evolved systems as well as vestiges of prior systems. In human evolution, aging systems chronologically emerged as follows: telomere shortening, mitochondrial aging, mutation accumulation, senescent gene expression (AS4), targeted somatic tissue apoptotic-atrophy (AS5), and female reproductive tissue apoptotic-atrophy (AS6). During famine or drought, to avoid extinction, reproduction is curtailed and aging is slowed or somewhat reversed to postpone or reverse reproductive senescence. AS4-AS6 are gradual and reversible aging systems. The life-extending/rejuvenating effects of caloric restriction support the idea of aging reversibility. Development and aging are timed by the gradual loss of cytosine methylation in the genome. Methylated cytosines (5mC) inhibit gene transcription, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) cleavage by restriction enzymes. Cleavage inhibition prevents apoptosis, which requires DNA fragmentation. Free radicals catalyze the demethylation of 5mC while antioxidants catalyze the remethylation of cytosine by altering the activity of DNA methyltransferases. Hormones act as either surrogate free radicals by stimulating the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway or as surrogate antioxidants through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway stimulation. Access to DNA containing 5mC inhibited developmental and aging genes and restriction sites is allowed by DNA helicase strand separation. Tightly wound DNA does not allow this access. The DNA helicase generates free radicals during strand separation; hormones either amplify or counteract this effect. Caloric restriction slows or reverses the aging process by increasing melatonin levels, which suppresses reproductive and free radical hormones, while increasing antioxidant hormone levels. Cell apoptosis during CR leads to somatic wasting and a release of DNA, which increases bioavailable cGMP. The rapid aging diseases of progeria, the three diseases: (xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne syndrome(CS), and ataxia telangiectasia (AT)), and Werner's syndrome are related to or caused by defects in three separate DNA helicases. The rapid aging diseases caused by mitochondrial malfunctions mirror those seen in XP, CS, and AT. Comparing these diseases allows for assignment of the different symptoms of aging to their respective aging systems. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) demethylates the genes of AS4, luteinizing hormone (LH) of AS5, and estrogen of AS6 while cortisol may act cooperatively with FSH and LH, and 5-alpha dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with FSH in these role. The Werner's DNA helicase links timing of the age of puberty, menopause, and maximum lifespan in one mechanism. Telomerase is under hormonal control. Most cancers likely result from malfunctions in the programmed apoptosis of AS5 and AS6. The Hayflick limit is reached primarily through loss of cytosine methylation of genes that inhibit replication. Men suffer the diseases of AS4 at a higher rate than women who suffer from AS5 more often. Adult mammal cloning suggests aging-related cellular demethylation, and thus aging, is reversible. This theory suggests that the protective effect of smoking and ibuprofen for Alzheimer's disease is caused through LH suppression.},

We have investigated the structure of these active fragments and demonstrate that upon reduction, each possesses a heavy chain of 28,000. The associated light chains were identified by subjecting iodinated proteins to two-dimensional slab gel electrophoresis in which the second dimension is run reduced. The 40,000-dalton enzyme has a light chain of 15,000, the 30,000-dalton form of HFf has a light chain of 2,000 and we have suggestive evidence of a light chain associated with the 28,500-dalton form of HFf (putative mol wt ~500). We also demonstrate that the 30,000-dalton form of HFf precedes the 28,500 form. These data indicate that digestion of native HF to form HFa precedes cleavages that fragment the molecule and diminish its molecular weight. The 28,500-dalton light chain of HFa becomes the heavy chain of each of the fragmentation products while cleavage at different points along the heavy chain of HFa determines which fragments will be produced. In contrast to autoactivation, kallikrein digestion of HFa yields primarily HFf; however, the 40,000-dalton enzyme may be seen when prekallikrein-deficient (Fletcher trait) plasma is activated.},

	abstract = {Lyme borreliosis caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is now the most common vector-borne disease in North America, Europe and Asia. It is a multisystemic infection which may cause skin, neurological, cardiac or reumatologic disorders. The aims of the present thesis were: (i) to develop a PCR assay for direct detection of B.burgdorferi DNA and to evaluate the diagnostic utility of PCR in clinical specimens from patients with Lyme borreliosis and (ii) to study the taxonomic classification of B.burgdorferi isolates and its implications for epidemiology and clinical presentation. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis by direct demonstration of B.burgdorferi in clinical specimens would compared to current serology allow (i) optimal specificity, (ii) increased sensitivity during the first weeks of infection, when the antibody response is not yet detectable and (iii) discrimination between ongoing and past infection. Due to the extreme paucity of spirochetes in clinical specimens neither in vitro culture nor antigen detection had yielded a sufficient diagnostic sensitivity. Thus the recently introduced highly sensitive PCR methodology could be a solution and was thus studied. Assays for PCR amplification and subsequent identification of B.burgdorferi specific sequences were established and used. For all assays the analytical sensitivity was a few genome copies using purified DNA as template. The efficacy of PCR was initially evaluated using tissue samples from experimentally infected gerbils in order to start with biological samples a priori known to contain B.burgdorferi. B.burgdorferi DNA was detectable in 88% of the specimens. Thus the diagnostic sensitivity of PCR was comparable to and even higher than in vitro culture. PCR was significantly more sensitive than a histological B.burgdorferi specific immunophosphatase-staining method. The utility of the PCR was then tested for identification of B.burgdorferi DNA in skin biopsies from 31 patients with erythema migrans. The sensitivity of PCR was 71%, which was superior to culture and serology. Based on own and otherwise published results there is clear evidence for PCR being the most sensitive and specific test for detection of B.burgdorferi in skin biopsies from patients with both early and late dermatoborreliosis. However, since the clinical diagnosis of dermatoborreliosis in most instances is easy, an invasive procedure as a skin biopsy, will only be justified in patients with an atypical clinical presentation. The most frequent and serious manifestation of disseminated Lyme borreliosis is neuroborreliosis. PCR was applied to 190 patients with untreated and confirmed neuroborreliosis. B.burgdorferi DNA was detectable in 17-21% of CSF samples from patients with neuroborreliosis. In patients with very early neuroborreliosis (< 2 weeks), still being negative for specific intrathecal antibody synthesis, a positive PCR was more frequent than in patients with longer disease duration. PCR can be used as a diagnostic aid in these patients. However, in general the measurement of specific intrathecal antibody production in patients with neuroborreliosis was superior to PCR. In urine samples from patients with Lyme borreliosis the diagnostic sensitivity varied, generally showing a low reproducibility. Urine is thus not regarded as a suitable sample source for B.burgdorferi PCR. The reason may be the variable presence of Taq polymerase inhibitors. Based on a semi-quantitative detection system for amplicons, reflecting the input amount of specific DNA and thus the density of spirochetes in the clinical samples high amounts of DNA were found in skin biopsies whereas especially in urine the amount of DNA was low. When the present study was initiated there was no accepted classification of B.burgdorferi. A heterogeneity among B.burgdorferi strains might have important implications for understanding the epidemiology and different clinical presentations (dermatoborreliosis versus neuroborreliosis) and courses (self-limiting versus chronic disease). Furthermore, strain differences were of importance for selection of suitable antigens for diagnostic assays and for vaccine development. Since then, B.burgdorferi isolates have been studied by phenotypic and genotypic traits and have been shown to be highly heterogeneous. Our first approach was to genotype a panel of human B.burgdorferi isolates by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of three genes. Thereafter, sequencing and dideoxy fingerprinting of ospA was applied. By RFLP the strains could be differentiated into two to five groups. The RFLP classification was compared with four different phenotypic and genotypic methods including the rRNA typing. Results obtained with the different methods correlated highly and confirmed the meanwhile accepted taxonomic classification by Baranton et al.. According to this the term B.burgdorferi sensu lato comprises three different human pathogenic genospecies B.burgdorferi sensu stricto, B.garinii and B.afzelii. All three genospecies have been isolated among Danish patients with Lyme borreliosis and are thus prevalent in Denmark. Since isolation of B.burgdorferi from patients with Lyme borreliosis is laborious and often unsuccessful molecular typing methods based on PCR are recommended obviating the need for isolation by prior culture. Of special interest was to study a possible association of neuroborreliosis to certain B.burgdorferi genospecies, indicating species depended organotropism. By RFLP all six CSF isolates tested belonged to B.garinii and that 6 out of 7 isolates from patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans belonged to B.afzelii. Due to the low culture yield of B.burgdorferi from CSF, the association of B.garinii and neuroborreliosis was further studied by sequence analysis and dideoxyfinger-printing analysis of ospA PCR amplicons obtained from CSF samples from patients with neuroborreliosis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that in 11 out of 13 patients B.garinii DNA was found in CSF. These data strongly supports the hypothesis that B.garinii is the principal agent of Lyme neuroborreliosis in Europe. Similarly it was shown that B.afzelii is associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and thus dermatoborreliosis.

These communities are marked by cultural, socioeconomic, and historical patterns that differ from other rural groups and that lead to a distinctive set of social problems. When compared to a national sample of youth, American Indian and Alaskan Native youth show exceptionally high levels of drug use. Because they share a number of similar cultural characteristics, it could be hypothesized that the rates of drug use among these Native groups are related to cultural traits. However, non-Native Alaskan youth also have high rates of drug use, indicating that there are factors in the social environment other than culture that account for this behavior. Possible explanatory factors include uncertain economic conditions, family instability, and lack of access to cultural values. Although rural living in itself is not necessarily a contributing factor to drug use, it does place some constraints on intervention efforts. Geographic isolation and lack of adequate health and social service resources make it difficult to develop adequate prevention and treatment services.},

	abstract = {Although patients frequently experience sleep disturbances and nightmares in the first weeks after a severe burn, information is scarce on the course and prevention of this problem. Prolonged experience of nightmares in adults is one of the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. The aim of this work was to determine risk factors for developing chronic nightmares after severe burns. Personality traits and coping strategies were assessed. As part of a follow-up study of patients treated at the Burn Center at Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, between 1980 and 1995, the questionnaires of 166 patients (34 females, 132 males, average age 50 years, average burn size 25% TBSA, full-thickness burn size 10% TBSA, average time since burn 11.4 years) were analyzed. The effects of individual personality traits and coping strategies on the frequency of nightmares were evaluated by regression analysis. Nightmares were reported by 43% of the patients, by females more frequently than males. The frequency of nightmares was shown to be associated with the size of the full-thickness burn. The use of Avoidance or Revaluation/Adjustment scales as coping strategies and the presence of Somatic Trait Anxiety as a personality trait were associated with a higher frequency of nightmares after correction for gender. In contrast, persons seeking Emotional Support as a coping strategy reported significantly fewer nightmares. Certain personality traits and coping strategies apparently increase the risk of having nightmares after a severe burn. Helping persons at risk develop different coping strategies may be a possible means of prevention or treatment.},

Here the focus is on breeding for improved resistance to infectious diseases. In comparison to conventional farming, one has to acknowledge that the spectrum of diseases in animals reared under organic conditions is different and that the proportion of the breeding stock of animals in organic farming is considerably smaller. There are at least four different approaches that may be used in breeding towards resistance to infectious diseases. The most obvious is to record disease incidence in the progeny and select those parents that produce the progeny with the lowest incidences of disease. Another approach is to use breeders possessing certain major histocompatibility complex antigens suggested being associated with resistance to certain infections. A third approach is to analyse the heritability of a set of immune functions or related traits crucial for resistance to infections and then use the traits with high heritability in breeding programmes. Finally, one may genetically select animals for high immune response using an index that combines estimated breeding values for several immunological traits. Examples of these various approaches are given and the feasibility for using these in organic farming are discussed.},

Drinking water with nitrate and pig manure also contained bacterially produced nitrite. Ten littermates from ten litters were randomly allocated within litters to the ten treatment combinations. The pigs were put on trial after weaning at 3 weeks of age (6.0 ± 1.0 kg live weight). All ten litters were on trial for six weeks while six litters continued on trial until slaughter at 90 kg live weight. The pigs were fed ad libitum the first 6 weeks and then according to live weight. They had free access to the drinking water. Nitrate had no detrimental effects on incidence of weaning diarrhoea, growth rate, feed intake, feed utilization, and water consumption or on blood hemoglobin and methemoglobin content. Likewise the bacterially produced levels of nitrite (maximum level of 17 ppm) had no detrimental effects on these parameters. However, pig manure decreased water consumption and growth rate without affecting the blood traits. We conclude that early weaned piglets and growing pigs can tolerate at least 2000 ppm nitrate in drinking water. However, pig manure in drinking water reduces water consumption and growth rate. © 1994.},

	abstract = {Probiotics are cultures of special microorganisms, which have been used as feed additives since the seventies of the past century and already since the twenties in food specimen and in pharmaceuticals. The definition of "Probioticum" was formulated in 1974 simultaneously with the use of living cultures in feed for various animals in order to substitute the application of nutritive antibiotics or chemotherapeutics. In the meantime probiotics are applied not only as feed supplements or pharmaceuticals but increasingly in suitable food specimens such as dairy products, fruit juices, chocolates, and even meat products. Of course, heating of such products prior to consumption or application must be ruled out. The selection of a suitable strain of a microorganism can be regarded as the primary requirement for the use as a probiotic. These cultures must be able to pass the stomach-duodenum barrier in a viable state and to multiply at the site of destination in the intestine. Additionally, they must be capable of producing antagonistic metabolites against a dominating saprophytic microflora resulting in a competitive growth. These abilities are common among lactic acid bacteria, e.g. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Yet, intended autochthonous species do not possess very good technological features for the enrichment in food specimens, because their viability will decrease rapidly under unfavourable conditions as it is the case with mineral supplements in feed or with low acidity in fermented dairy products. Therefore, some other microorganisms like spore-forming species or yeast cultures were introduced as probiotic components. These possess some similar features which render them suitable for probiotic use. But their physiological and ecological traits do not qualify them as probiotics of first choice. The special efficacy of probiotics must be strictly verified in animal nutrition due to restrictive EC-regulations, in pharmacy due to legal restraints, and in food applications in accordance with food law regulations. Safety aspects are considered very restrictively in feed applications, in the food and pharmaceutical sector they should be in accordance with the intended purpose of "fulfilling health claims". In the presented review the different requirements for the application of probiotics in animal nutrition, in food, and in pharmaceuticals will be provided. The special effect of competitive exclusion of pathogenetic and toxinogenic microorganisms in fowl performance are mentioned and even the application of probiotics as marine aquacultures of fish and Crustaceae will be included. Furthermore, the safety aspects resulting from the tremendous amount of industrially produced cultures which are distributed into the environment will be discussed. In conclusion it may be pointed out that probiotics may serve to partially replace the presently reduced or even prohibited application of nutritive antibiotics or chemotherapeutics in animal nutrition and in fulfilment of health claims in man and animals. Economic and environmental aspects will reduce the overall application of probiotics world-wide. Restrictions of use and controls of efficacy and safety are essential and must be implemented periodically.},

	abstract = {A brief survey of the development of concepts on the role of macromutations in evolution is given. Contrary to Iu. A. Filipchenko (1926, 1927), who introduced the "micro- and macromutation" terms and believed that regularities of macroevolution could not be reduced to microevolutionary processes, the majority of "synthetists" explained any form of evolution by changes in allele frequencies. From the studies of Drosophila homoeotic mutants R. Goldschmidt (1940) developed the concept of "hopeful monsters" and their role in macroevolution. However, the homoeotic mutants are of drastically reduced viability, which allows the gradualists to reject Goldschmidt's ideas. The distribution of hairlessness mutations (hairless, nude etc.) with the monogenic pattern of inheritance in mammals was studied. Hairless mutants are known in Peromyscus, Mus musculus, Rattus rattus, R. norvegicus, Canis familiaris, Ovis aries. Hairlessness as norm is found in 53 among contemporaneous 1037 mammalian genera. Part of these cases (hairlessness in all Cetacea and Sirenia) may be explained in terms of both macromutations and obligatory gradualism. There is no doubt as to the macromutational origin of hairlessness in the bat Cheiromeles and the rodent Heterocephalus (Bathyergidae); the genera systematically and ecologically close to these have normal pelage. It is quite possible that hairlessness of walrus (Odobenus) has the same origin. The appearance and fixation of single Goldschmidt's macromutation cannot yet be considered as a macroevolutionary process, though the possibility of fixation of a macromutation in nature as a species and genus character contradicts strongly the concept of obligatory gradualism of evolution.},

First of all, we report that inorganic nitrite in the solid phase can serve as an effective nitrosating agent for solutions of amines in certain nonaqueous media. Secondly, we describe evidence suggesting that the appearance of nitrosamines as contaminants in deionized water (Cohen, 1977; Gough et al., 1977; Fiddler et al., 1977) might result at least partly from simple, acid catalyzed nitrosation of the amine/ammonium functional groups on the anion exchange resins used in the demineralization process. Possible implications of both phenomena are discussed and potentially useful measures for their control are suggested.},

	abstract = {An investigation was carried out on 40 cut samples trees (20 fairly vital and 20 trees of poor vitality) taken from experimental plots whose description was given in another paper. The aim of the study was to determine the content of sulphur, zinc, lead, manganese, magnesium, and calcium in one-year and two-year needles from cut firs, and to characterize possible dependences between the amount of the investigated constituents and the vitality of the trees. The content of the investigated compounds was also compared in the two groups of stands characterized by the value of index II below 0.70 or above 0.70. The experimental plots were represented by the cut sample trees mentioned above. The content of sulphur in the assimilation system of fir was double that found about 25 years ago. Two-year needles of vital trees contained significantly more sulphur than weakened trees. The obtained results suggest that the entire range of fir distribution is polluted with sulphur. With a similar degree of pollution differences in the vitality of trees and stands may result from more favourable habitat conditions, morphological traits of trees (the crown), and also their individual resistance. The synergistic action of sulphur and other compounds may also play an important role. Chemical analysis of the assimilation system of fir showed a fairly large content of zinc. In stands from the regions of Olkusz, Andrychow, and Zagnansk (plot III), and also of Gorlice, Ustron, and Jelesnia the share of Zn in needle dry weight exceeded the norm (66 ppm) for needles of coniferous trees. However, it should be stressed here that according to Kloke no damage caused by zinc excess appears below the concentrations of 500-7500 ppm. In needles from 13 stands the concentrations of lead exceeded the normal content of this metal (3.0-5.4 ppm) 2-3 times. Analyses of increment (index II) and Pb content in particular experimental plots did not permit to formulate clear conclusions concerning the toxic action of this metal on fir. The investigated stands classified in two categories of forests as depending upon the value of index II, differ by the content of manganese (in general, the content of this metal in needles varied from 214-5810 ppm). The greater content of this constituent was found in the assimilation system fron stands with index II exceeding 0.70, i.e., from the more vital ones. Analyses of Ca, Mg, and K content showed sufficient amounts of these macroelements in the investigated trees, a significantly greater content of Mg being found in two-year needles of more vital trees.},

The reasons for the emergence and re-emergence of infections are not well understood but appear to be associated with factors that involve the pathogen, the host and the environment. These factors are often inter-related and act together in a complex manner to bring about changes in patterns of infection. Pathogens are extremely resourceful and possess mechanisms to adapt to new hosts and environments as well as to acquire new virulence traits. Host factors include herd immunity, social behaviour and demographics. Environmental factors like the climate, deforestation and new technologies have an impact on the emergence of infections. The challenge is to contain an infection when it emerges but more importantly to prevent its emergence in the first place. As the emergence of an infection is complex and multifactorial, a multidisciplinary approach is required. Health based strategies alone are insufficient. Social, economic and environmental measures and the political will to implement appropriate policies are equally important.},

Conventional breeding efforts to enhance the level of resistance to a number of insect pests and tolerance to drought have been successful, although only through large efforts of many breeders and over a large period of time. Continued improvements will only be possible through substantial investment of resources. Recently, success in identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) in several plant species using various molecular marker systems offers alternative methods for accelerating conventional breeding programs. As the first step towards using molecular markers in CIMMYT's maize breeding program, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been used to understand the genetic basis of resistance to two corn borer species, southwestern corn borer and sugarcane borer, and to one major component of drought tolerance, anthesis-silking interval. A number of QTL with effects large enough to be regarded as significant in breeding were detected for each of these traits and many of them presented stable effects over environments. While variability in the number and location of QTL has been found when compared across populations, several loci were found to be quite consistent. Simple calculations can be made which estimate that the total genetic potential in maize for these traits is high. It is argued that to ultimately access and manipulate this potential, the use of linked molecular markers as indirect selectable markers is both feasible and necessary.},

	abstract = {The pathological events leading to the destruction of the periodontium during inflammatory periodontal diseases are likely to represent complex interactions involving an imbalance in enzymic and non-enzymic degradative mechanisms. This paper aims to review the increasing body of evidence implicating reactive oxygen species (ROS), derived from many metabolic sources, in the pathogenesis of periodontal tissue destruction. ROS are generated predominantly by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) during an inflammatory response and are regarded as being highly destructive in nature. The detection of ROS oxidation products, the elevation of iron and copper ions, which catalyse the production of the most reactive radical species, and the identification of an imbalance in the oxidant/antioxidant activity within periodontal pockets, suggests a significant role for ROS in periodontal tissue destruction. In vitro studies have shown that ROS are capable of degrading a number of extracellular matrix components including proteoglycans, resulting in the modification of amino acid functional groups, leading to fragmentation of the core protein, whilst the constituent glycosaminoglycan chains undergo limited depolymerisation. The identification and characterisation of connective tissue metabolites in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) resulting from the degradation of periodontal tissues, notably alveolar bone, provides further evidence for a role for ROS in tissue destruction associated with inflammatory periodontal diseases.},

	abstract = {It is difficult to overestimate the evolutionary pressures exerted over the past few thousand years by endemic malaria. For most of hominid evolution, these parasites probably caused little morbidity and mortality. However, as Livingstone (1964, 1967, 1971) has pointed out, the advent of slash and burn horticulture and associated sedentary living patterns dramatically changed this situation. For many human populations, endemic malaria became an evolutionary emergency. In such pressing circumstances, genetic traits which ordinarily would carry with them an intolerable genetic load actually increase in frequency. Thus, although a few antimalarial red cell characteristics such as Duffy negativity are evidently innocuous, the majority of malaria-selected traits are not. Ovalocytosis, the abnormal hemoglobins and G-6-PD deficiencies are all quite deleterious in the homo- or hemizygote. This, more than anything else, bespeaks the extraordinary evolutionary pressures exerted by malaria. Needless to say, the mechanisms by which these various red cell traits protect are incompletely known. Although our discussion of such mechanisms has revolved about parasite/host cell relationships, the actual antimalarial effect may involve more distal interactions, especially of infected erythrocytes with the immune and reticuloendothelial systems. Protection exerted by modifications of such interactions would not be revealed by in vitro culture experiments upon which we rely for much of our information. For example, as normal red cells age and senesce, they express novel surface antigens which are recognized by specific immunoglobulins (Kay, 1983). Cells which have bound such antibodies are likely recognized and destroyed rapidly by the reticuloendothelial system. The expression of such senescence antigens may be hastened in already abnormal cells subject to the additional burden of an internal parasite. Therefore, it is quite possible that congenital defects of the red cell membrane, hemoglobin and metabolism may afford protection against malaria via immunologic mechanisms rather than by blocking penetration or predisposing the cell to spontaneous intravascular lysis. To be successful in the mammalian host, erythrocytic phase of malaria must recognize and attach to the host red cell, successfully penetrate, and replicate within. Remarkably, there are antimalarial red cells which impair each one of these individual steps. In this case, the ingenuity of natural selection has been almost--but not quite--a match for that of the malaria parasite.},

Accidents due to burn trauma are disproportionately common among children when compared with adults, and during childhood years make up a sizable proportion of all injuries, in addition to the immediate physical trauma, there can be severe psychological consequences as well as severe disturbances to family life. Seventy per cent of the children In this series were normal active children less than four years of age, who were too young to learn that certain things are dangerous, and for this group preventative measures must be directed towards the parents. Possible methods of prevention of burns In children are discussed, and It Is tragic that the very traits that make young children so engaging also lead them to accidental burn injuries. Their only hope of prevention lies In increased parental concern. A survey has been done of 382 burns admitted to the Burns Unit, Royal Children's Hospital, over a five and a half year period, there being 250 males and 132 females. The cause of these burns is described, particularly the common causes such as kitchen scalds, bath scalds, petrol burns and clothes burns, as well as predisposing causes. These are discussed to give an overall picture of the epidemiology of childhood burns. The comparison is made with other series from Australia, and possible methods of preventing these injuries are discussed. It is tragic that the very traits that make young children so engaging also lead them to accidental burn injury. The only hope of prevention lies in an increased parental concern.

It is demonstrated how achievements of biochemical genetics are used for the identification of chromosomes of certain homoeologous group in close relatives of common wheat. The examples are shown how these genes may be used as selected markers for the screening of segregating populations when selecting plants with the locus required if the assessment of its own manifestation presents difficulties. The conclusion is made that biochemical markers are a convenient tool that may be used for the transformation of the wheat genome by means of incorporating of alien genes.},

	abstract = {A review of the literature was undertaken to consider the possible effects of human intervention (shepherding) at around the time of parturition in extensively farmed sheep. There is little clear empirical evidence to suggest that shepherding ensures either easy births or the integrity of ewe-lamb contact-factors closely linked to the welfare of the animals at this time. There is similarly no clear support for shepherding being harmful. However, the following suggestions are made: first, human presence can inhibit or delay parturition; second, extended parturition can increase the risk of, or is associated with, dystocia; and third, disturbance at birth can compromise ewe-lamb bonding and consequently lamb survival. Furthermore, sheep populations that have undergone rigorous selection for ease of lambing and minimal shepherding in extensive environments have well-documented physical and behavioural traits underlying their predisposition for enhanced lamb survival. Although our cultural legacy may impose a duty to intensively monitor animals at lambing, it is concluded that, at least in some situations, shepherding may not be entirely beneficial. The commonly held view of the necessity for some human intervention in extensive livestock systems is perhaps overly paternalistic, and requires a more comprehensive appraisal.},

	abstract = {Disease is a major issue in animal production systems and society demands that the use of medicines and vaccines be reduced. This review describes the breeding approaches that could be used to improve disease resistance and focuses especially on their application to pigs. Disease reduction by genetic means has certain advantages through cumulative and permanent effects, and direct and indirect selection methods are available. Direct selection for disease incidence requires, besides a unique pig identification and disease registration system, challenge routines that are inconvenient in intensive pig production. Indirect selection for the expression of immune capacity may be an alternative but requires detailed knowledge of the different components of the immune system. There is ample opportunity for genetic improvement of the immune capacity because immune traits show substantial genetic variation between pigs. We therefore conclude that indirect selection via immune traits is very interesting, also for practical implementation, and that there is an urgent need for knowledge, within lines, about the genetic relationships between immune capacity traits and resistance to specific diseases or to disease incidence in general. Furthermore, knowledge about the relationship between immune system traits and production traits is needed as well as knowledge about the effect of selection on the epidemiology of disease at a farm/population level and on the host-pathogen interaction and coevolution. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

These studies involve numerous individuals, populations, species, and higher taxa in nature of plants, animals, and humans tested for variation at 15 to 50 primary isozyme loci. The isozyme studies have been conducted mainly in individuals sampled in natural populations at the local, regional, and global levels. Two of the species studied were wild cereals, the progenitors of wheat and barley in the Near East Fertile Crescent. These studies have been complemented by laboratory controlled a priori experimentation of inorganic and organic pollution biology. The human genetics laboratory compared isozyme structure of Jewish and non-Jewish populations. Our results indicate that: (i) isozyme diversity in nature in abundant, at least partly adaptive, and is oriented and maintained primarily by ecological factors. (ii) Natural selection in action is highlighted by stresses involving among others thermal, chemical, and climatic factors. (iii) Speciation can occur with little change in isozyme diversity. (iv) Jews from diverse countries, and in spite of 2,000 years of Diaspora, retain in the frequencies of some isozymes their Near Eastern origins. (v) Wild cereals harbor rich genetic resources exploitable in breeding either directly as adaptive structures, or indirectly as genetic markers for genotypic production of elite agronomic traits. (vi) Isozymes have been utilized as genetic monitors of marine pollution thereby contributing to environmental quality and conservation. (vii) Isozymes can substantially contribute to conservation biology. (viii) Isozymes have been successfully utilized in constructing molecular phylogenies and in revealing new sibling species.

Here the focus is on breeding for improved resistance to infectious diseases. In comparison to conventional farming, one has to acknowledge that the spectrum of diseases in animals reared under organic conditions is different and that the proportion of the breeding stock of animals in organic farming is considerably smaller. There are at least four different approaches that may be used in breeding towards resistance to infectious diseases. The most obvious is to record disease incidence in the progeny and select those parents that produce the progeny with the lowest incidences of disease. Another approach is to use breeders possessing certain major histo-compatibility complex antigens suggested being associated with resistance to certain infections. A third approach is to analyse the heritability of a set of immune functions or related traits crucial for resistance to infections and then use the traits with high heritability in breeding programmes. Finally, one may genetically select animals for high immune response using an index that combines estimated breeding values for several immunological traits. Examples of these various approaches are given and the feasibility for using these in organic farming are discussed.},

Genetic differences in the metabolism of xenobiotics among inbred strains of various laboratory animals and model systems are reviewed. The inbred mouse has been studied most extensively. Genetic differences in toxicity are shown to be caused by various environmental pollutants in several inbred strains of mice and in siblings of the (C57BL/6N) (DBA/2N)F1 x DBA/2N backcross, in which the phenotypes 'aromatic hydrocarbon responsiveness' or 'nonresponsiveness' had been predetermined. This trait of 'responsiveness' - which refers to the capacity for induction of cytochrome P1450 and numerous monooxygenase activities by certain aromatic compounds, segregates almost exclusively as a single gene among offspring of this backcross. All nonresponsive mice ingesting benzo(a)pyrene (about 125 mg/kg per day) die within 4 wk, whereas the survival of responsive mice receiving the chemical orally is not significantly different from that of control mice; the apparent cause of early death in these experiments is toxic depression of the bone marrow. The life span of animals exposed to certain environmental pollutants can, therefore, be markedly influenced by a single gene or a very small number of genes. The same genetic trait can be either beneficial or detrimental to the animal, depending on whether detoxification or metabolic potentiation occurs. There also may exist genetic differences in man's susceptibility to toxicity or cancer caused by the numerous foreign compounds in his environment.},

Under pasture feeding, experimental data strongly suggest that selection and genetic evaluation for growth performance should be based on weight-for-age rather than on post-weaning weight gains. Carcass merit is more appropriately measured by the yield of trimmed boneless retail cuts than by accepted commercial grades. Relative to the nationally predominant Angus beef breed, research results demonstrate an advantage in final and carcass weight per animal of 5-10% for the Hereford and 20-30% for the Friesian, with the superiority being approximately halved in crossed with the Angus. In terms of weaning performance, the Friesian dam is greatly superior, the Hereford slightly inferior, to the Angus. Heterosis for growth traits is of the order of 5%. In crosses over Jersey cows the Charolais sire is superior to the Hereford but not to the Friesian for total meat output. Carcasses from the dairy breeds and dairy x beef crosses slaughtered at the same age contain a higher bone percentage and are less acceptable on traditional export grading standards than those of the British beef breeds, but nevertheless achieve high output and quality of lean meat. Preliminary results from current large-scale trials suggest that the larger European breeds have potential for improving growth rate and meat yield in crosses with local Angus and Hereford cattle but are more prone to difficult calvings and show later sexual maturity. © 1975.},

	abstract = {Medawar's 1952 paper 'An Unsolved Problem of Biology' underlies most subsequent theoretical work regarding the evolution of aging; it concludes that aging is accidental and could not have evolved; this prevents reconciling the growing body of evidence suggesting the existence of multiple, evolved, aging systems. The paper features a well-known thought experiment using test tubes to show why aging could not evolve. Medawar assumes that constant, random, breakage sufficiently represents lethal forces of nature; however, famine, drought, predation, disease, and accidents each uniquely affect populations. Predation is the only evolving force that continually invents new ways to kill members of the prey populations; thus all prey defenses to predation will eventually be defeated. Defenses to non-evolving or non-obligate lethal forces, however, should quickly evolve. Thus unevolving, identical test tubes cannot adequately represent biological populations. The example also ignores population booms and busts which often occur in nature. By ignoring these issues, Medawar examines only one population age distribution skewed towards younger individuals in predator-dominated environments while ignoring predator-free populations skewed towards older individuals after population crashes. Further, Medawar's test tubes lack meaningful competition for finite resources, and ignore declining fertility which occurs in all aging species. Medawar concludes that older individuals are too few in number to influence the population's gene pool for or against aging. This conclusion is found to be incorrect when variations in the age of reproductive senescence are introduced into a predator-free population. A new thought experiment with competing strains of algae corrects for these issues and shows that aging evolved and is retained so that groups retain enough genetic variability to allow for rapid evolution of a defense to novel predation. The example shows reasons why the rate of aging is directly linked to the reproductive rate, litter size, metabolic rate, reproductive senescence, and fixed body size. It also suggests that in the absence of predation, immortality would quickly evolve if not for the evolution of highly-conserved aging systems. Prior analysis of aging evolution is incorrect due to theorists' rejection of the idea of group selection. It is believed to be 'impossible' to select for mutations that are bad for the individual but good for the group. However, mutations that are neutral to young individuals which are only deleterious if expressed at order ages can accumulate in early-mortality, predator-dominated environments. Removing the predator allows deleterious mutation expression. Positive group selection then occurs amongst traits that are negative to the individual. Further, group selection is a universal force that occurs between local, non-breeding groups and not, as theorists propose, between distant groups of potentially interbreeding species. Local survivors migrate to replace extinct, related species. The antagonistic pleiotropy theory, which was created to salvage the idea of accidental aging, is examined and shown to be untenable. The hypothetical antagonistic pleiotropy genes that are beneficial to young while detrimental to old individuals, predicted to exist in the 1950s, are unlikely to exist, have not, and likely will not be found in sufficient quantity to participate in the aging process.

	abstract = {On August 15, 1978, the integrated parasite control/family planning program was launched by the National Family Planning Board in the Tanjong Malim Estate in Kuala Lumpur (the estate is a rubber oil palm plantation) to enhance the health status of the estate workers and their families. Personal hygiene, good toilet habits, and washing fruits and vegetables before eating were emphasized. Pre- and post-surveys of worm infestation of the estate population revealed that treatment with drugs dramatically reduced the rate of intestinal helminthiasis infection among the population. To sustain the prevention or total eradication of the disease, an ongoing educational program was initiated and included the following features: 1) increasing knowledge of the community as to how intestinal helminthiasis is transmitted, and ways of limiting transmission; 2) providing safe and sanitary toilet facilities for young children, and; 3) periodic deworming of susceptible population every 3 months. The estate members are also encouraged to plant vegetables in their backyard. The National Family Planning Board also helped the estate members organize different functional groups, such as Mothers' Group. This multifaceted approach to family planning appears to have an encouraging future, particularly in family development.},

	abstract = {Waste disposal in animal agriculture has become not only a management problem, but also an environmental pollution concern to people associated with the animal industries. The poultry industry has attempted to dry poultry waste to abate the waste disposal problem. Due to the high protein content of fresh poultry waste (as high as 50% CP), research has been conducted using dried poultry waste (DPW) as a protein supplement for chickens and cattle. However, data on recycling DPW through cattle is limited. This study was undertaken to determine the value of DPW as a supplemental protein source for feedlot cattle. Five rations balanced to 12% crude protein were compared. DPW was combined with either soy or urea, 50% of the required supplemental protein was derived from DPW and the other 50% from soy or urea. All rations were mixed in a horizontal mixer before feeding and all cattle were full fed twice daily. It was found that the source of protein had a large and highly significant effect on average daily gain. Average daily gain for the soy supplemented group (3.35 lb), was significantly greater than the group supplemented with DPW (2.75 lb), 50% DPW - 50% urea (3.03 lb). However, this was not significantly greater than the urea supplemented group (3.10 lb). No significant differences in average daily gain occurred between the groups supplemented with urea, 50% DPW - 50% soy or 50% DPW - 50% urea. Feed efficiency was superior for the soy supplemented group followed by urea. The feed cost per cwt of gain was lowest for the 50% DPW - 50% urea supplemented group ($14.58) followed closely by urea ($15.03) and soy ($15.31) supplemented groups. The dried poultry waste ($18.87) and the 50% DPW - 50% soy ($16.84) supplemented groups had the highest cost per cwt of gain. Steers refused to consume the DPW portion of the ration. This partially explains the poor feeding efficiency and performance of the DPW and 50% DPW - 50% soy supplemented groups. The steers sorted the shelled corn and corn silage from the well mixed ration leaving almost as much dry poultry waste as had been presented. The carcass evaluation data showed no significant difference when the groups were compared. Nor was there any significant difference between treatments for carcass quality traits.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine effects of electrical stimulation (ES) on muscle quality and sensory traits of 12 Hampshire × Rambouillet callipyge lambs. One side of each carcass was randomly assigned to an ES treatment of 550 V and 60 Hz of electricity for 2 s on and 2 s off 15 times. The other side was a nonstimulated control (NES). Heated calpastatin, sarcomere length, myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), Warner-Bratzler shear (WBS), and trained sensory panel values were measured on the semitendinosus (ST), semimembranosus (SM), longissimus (ML), supraspinatus (SP), and triceps brachii (TB) muscles. Electrically stimulating the carcass sides induced a more rapid (P = .001) pH decline in the longissimus muscle, and ES sides had a brighter (P = .001) red color of loineye than nonstimulated sides. At d 14 of storage (2°C), the TB had the highest (P < .05) MFI value, indicating more protein degradation, and the ST and ML muscles had the lowest MFI (P = .008). Regardless of ES treatment, SM and ML had the highest (P < .05) WBS values. The ST muscle had higher (P < .05) WBS values than the SP but did not differ (P > .05) from the TB muscle. Electrical stimulation had no effect on WBS or any trained sensory panel values (P > .05). The percentage of loin chops rated slightly tender or better was improved 30 to 34% by electrical stimulation (P < .05). The ML muscle was scored lower (P < .05) in sustained juiciness compared with the SM, SP, and TB but did not differ (P > .05) from the ST muscle. The SM and ML muscles were rated lower (P < .05) in initial and sustained tenderness scores than other muscles. Tenderness scores were higher (P < .05) for the TB than for the SP but did not differ (P > .05) from the ST muscle. Electrically stimulating callipyge carcasses improves the tenderness of loin chops by increasing the percentage of chops rated from slightly tough to slightly tender.},

	abstract = {The deficiency of a plasma protein which participates in the intrinsic coagulation, kinin forming, and plasma fibrinolytic pathways was reported recently by laboratories. They were recognized independently and identified by eponyms as Fitzgerald, Flaujeac and Williams traits. This trait is a deficient function of a plasma protein of the intrinsic coagulation, kinin forming, and plasma fibrinolytic pathways. In man this factor has been isolated and tentatively identified as a kininogen of high molecular weight (HMW). Highly purified bovine HMW kininogen, but not bovine low molecular weight kininogen, repaired Flaujeac factor deficiency. The two subspecies of this molecule, HMW kininogen a and HMW kininogen b, also corrected Flaujeac factor deficiency. When bovine HMW kininogen was incubated with bovine plasma kallikrein, kinin free HMW kininogen, bradykinin, and a glycopeptide fragment (peptide 1-2; 12,584 daltons) were rapidly released. None of these fragmentation products corrected Flaujeac factor deficiency alone or in mixtures. The function of HMW kininogen appeared to depend upon the structural integrity of the native molecule. When injected on concentrations of 2 pmol-8nmol/ 0.1 ml, peptide 1-2 caused increased vascular permeability in rabbits, rats, or guinea pigs. The enhanced permeability was maximal within 1-2 min and terminated in 5-10 min, differing from that of bradykinin or histamine. Injected together in equimolar amounts, peptide 1-2 and bradykinin produced a synergistic permeability response which was immediate in onset as well as prolonged in duration. Peptide 1-2 is a rapidly acting, highly basic glycopeptide which mediates increased vascular permeability in a complementary and synergistic manner with bradykinin.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the lower court's dismissal and allowed clerical or administrative workers to sue their employer for testing for "highly private and sensitive medical genetic information such as syphilis, sickle cell trait, and pregnancy" without either their consent or their knowledge during a general employee health examination. The court noted that "the most basic violation possible" of constitutional privacy interests involves the performance of unauthorized testing for medical information and that such testing may be viewed as illegal search under the Fourth Amendment in addition to violation of due process under the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments. Because there are "few subject areas more personal and more likely to implicate privacy interests than that of one's health or genetic make-up," the court concluded that the unauthorized testing constituted a significant invasion of the right to privacy under the Fourth Amendment. The court reasoned that neither consent to a general medical examination nor consent to providing blood or urine samples abolishes the privacy right not to be tested for intimate, personal matters involving one's health. Also, because black employees were singled out for sickle cell trait testing and female employees for pregnancy testing, the employer discriminated against them concerning terms or conditions of employment, thus violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.},
