	abstract = {Medicinal plants are used directly as therapeutic agents in various traditional practices, and medicinal plants like Dioscorea deltoidea, Papaver somniferum, Atropa belladonna, Rauvolfia serpentina, Hyoscyamus niger, Digitalis lanata, Datura metel, Digitalis purpurea, Pilocarpusa bonandi, Cinchona ledgeriana are contributing directly several prescribed medicinals. The ever-increasing trend in the use of medicinal herbs and herbal products in therapeutic purpose, research, and trade has created tremendous pressure on supply from their wild source. Under the circumstances of increasing demand, indiscriminate and over extraction from the wild, habitat destruction, etc., many of the naturally growing medicinal herbs are on the verge of extinction and thus unsustainability in the supply of medicinal plants from natural source. Systematic cultivation of medicinal herbs would be a viable alternative to overcome this unsustainability problem of medicinal plants from the wild source and cultivation offers opportunity to optimize yield and achieve a uniform, high-quality product. Several drugs like cardamom, cannabis, cinnamon, ginger, cinchona, opium, linseed, and fennel are now obtained almost exclusively from cultivation source. Benefits of cultivation of medicinal plants are widely viewed as a means for meeting current and future demands for large volume production of plant-based drugs; cultivation can reduce growing pressures on wild medicinal plants and ensure pure and smooth supply; means of earning livelihood, etc. The WHO has published wide-spectrum guidelines for good agricultural and collection practices for sustainable production of raw material of quality and standardized herbal ingredients to ensure quality of herbal medicines. Medicinal plants may be cultivated by the following: (a) agricultural practice at field level and (b) in vitro production of secondary metabolites. Commercial cultivation at field level (open field, homestead garden, forest floor) is an agronomic practice and offers the opportunity to overcome the problems that are inherent in herbal extracts like misidentification, genetic and phenotypic variability, extract variability and instability, toxic components, and contaminants. The agronomic method of crop cultivation includes systematically the steps like site and season selection, selection of crop, true seed or vegetative propagule, land preparation and basal manuring and fertilization, spacing, seed sowing or seedling transplantation, split application of fertilizer, irrigation, intercultural operation, and weed control and harvesting. Large-scale plant tissue or organ culture for the production of secondary metabolites is an attractive alternative approach to traditional methods of cultivation of drug plants. The advantages of this method are many; it is independent of soil, paste, climatic interference, geographical location, and it can ultimately provide a continuous and reliable source of natural products. Considering the cost involvement, plant tissue culture for secondary metabolites is now limited to only high-value compounds such as diosgenin-derived steroid hormone precursors, digitalis glycosides, berberine isoquinoline alkaloid, taxol, paclitaxel, and several other toxoids—complex diterpene alkaloids. Herbal plants have global market worth about US$62 billion per annum, and so they may be a good export item and wealth of a country and should be cultivated in commercial scale like any other conventional cash crops. As cultivation of medicinal plants at commercial scale is comparatively a new concept in many countries to meet the demand of internal and foreign markets and earning livelihood of the rural people, medicinal plants are important natural wealth and herbal wealth, play significant role in providing primary health-care services to rural people, and serve as raw material in traditional and modern pharmaceutical as well as in cosmetic, agricultural, and food industries. Substantial amount of foreign exchange can be earned by exporting medicinal plants to other countries. In this way, indigenous medicinal plants may play a significant role in the economy of a country. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

	abstract = {Background. The miracle plant, Synsepalum dulcificum (Schumach. & Thonn.) Daniell is a native African orphan crop species that has recently received increased attention due to its promise as a sweetener and source of antioxidants in both the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, a major obstacle to the species' widespread utilization is its relatively slow growth rate and prolonged juvenile period. Method. In this study, we tested twelve treatments made up of various watering regimes and exogenous nutrient application (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, at varying dosages) on the relative survival, growth, and reproductive development of 15-months-old S. dulcificum juveniles. Results. While the plants survived under most tested growing conditions, nitrogen application at doses higher than 1.5 g [seedling] -1 was found to be highly detrimental, reducing survival to 0%. The treatment was found to affect all growth traits, and juveniles that received a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (each at a rate of 1.5 g [seedling] -1), in addition to daily watering, exhibited the most vegetative growth. The simple daily provision of adequate water was found to greatly accelerate the transition to reproductive maturity in the species (from >36 months to an average of 23 months), whereas nutrient application affected the length of the reproductive phase within a season, as well as the fruiting intensity. Conclusions. This study highlights the beneficial effect of water supply and fertilization on both vegetative and reproductive growth in S. dulcificum. Water supply appeared to be the most important factor unlocking flowering in the species, while the combination of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium at the dose of 1.5 g (for all) consistently exhibited the highest performance for all growth and yield traits. These findings will help intensify S. dulcificum's breeding and horticultural development. © 2017 Tchokponhoué DA et al.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of airborne pathogens, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) through bioaerosol, and their molecular characterization around domestic poultry farming areas, was not completely understood. This imposes risk of a MRSA-associated health threat for the relevant livestock food production units. To address this issue, the present study investigated the role of bioaerosol in transmitting MRSA strains in poultry house settings by combining molecular typing, phylogenetic classification, antibiotic susceptibility, and virulence gene distribution pat-terns. The present study highlights that all 18 bioaerosol and stool samples collected were MRSA positive, with a unique set of virulence factors. Out of 57 isolated MRSA isolates, 68.4% and 19.3% consisted of SCCmec I and IV elements, respectively, which are commonly linked with hospital-acquired and livestock-associated MRSA strains. It is worth noting that the exfoliative toxin eta and etb genes were carried by 100% and 70.2% of all isolates, respectively. Only 17.5% of strains showed the presence of enterotoxin entC. These MRSA isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol (C), ciprofloxacin (CIP), clindamycin (DA), erythromycin (E), and tetracycline (T), signifying their multi-drug resistance traits. A cluster of phylogenetic analysis described that 80.7% and 15.8% of total isolates belonged to Staphylococcus aureus protein A (spa) type t002 and t548. Whereas 3.5% were reflected as a new spa type. Additionally, as per the chi-squared test score value, these two spa types (t002 and t548) have a distribution correlation with HA-MRSA and LA-MRSA in all the samples (p < 0.005, chi-squared test; degree of freedom = 1). Ultimately, this study highlights the prevalence of MRSA colonization in the conventional poultry farm environment, showing the risk of bioaerosol trans-mission, which needs epidemiological attention and prevention strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Forest dynamics encompass changes in stand structure, species composition, and species interactions with disturbance and environment over a range of spatial and temporal scales. For convenience, spatial scale is defined as individual tree, neighborhood, stand, and landscape. Whether a given canopy-leveling disturbance will initiate a sequence of development in structure with little change in composition or initiate an episode of succession depends on a match or mismatch, respectively, with traits of the dominant tree species that allow the species to survive disturbance. When these match, certain species-disturbance type combinations lock in a pattern of stand and landscape dynamics that can persist for several generations of trees; thus, dominant tree species regulate, as well as respond to, disturbance. A complex interaction among tree species, neighborhood effects, disturbance type and severity, landform, and soils determines how stands of differing composition form and the mosaic of stands that compose the landscape. Neighborhood effects (e.g., serotinous seed rain, sprouting, shading, leaf-litter chemistry, and leaf-litter physical properties) operate at small spatial extents of the individual tree and its neighbors but play a central role in forest dynamics by contributing to patch formation at stand scales and dynamics of the entire landscape. Dominance by tree species with neutral to negative neighborhood effects leads to unstable landscape dynamics in disturbance-prone regions, wherein most stands are undergoing succession; stability can only occur under very low-severity disturbance regimes. Dominance by species with positive effects leads to stable landscape dynamics wherein only a small proportion of stands undergo succession at any one time. Positive neighborhood effects are common in temperate and boreal zones, whereas negative effects are more common in tropical climates. Landscapes with positive dynamics have alternate categories of dynamics stabilized by high-severity and low-severity disturbance regimes. Contrary to prevailing ecological theory, systems with positive neighborhood effects can have similar levels of compositional stability across tree, stand, and landscape scales. Neighborhood effect theory can help explain responses of landscapes to large-scale land clearing and novel effects brought on by factors such as invasive species and deer overabundance. © 2016 Frelich L.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Estrogen-dependent cancers (e.g., breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers) are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in women worldwide. Recently, exosomes released by tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells have been under the spotlight in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Our study aims at elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the crosstalk between estrogen signaling and CD8+ T cells, and possible intervention values in uterine corpus endometrial cancer (UCEC). Methods: Micro RNA-seq was conducted to screen differentially expressed micro RNA in UCEC. Bioinformatic analysis was processed to predict the target of miR-765. RNA silencing or overexpressing and pharmacologic inhibitors were used to assess the functions of ERβ/miR-765/PLP2/Notch axis in UCEC cell proliferation and invasion in vivo and in vitro. In vivo imaging was performed to evaluate the metastasis of tumor in mice. Combined fluorescent in situ hybridization for miR-765 and immunofluorescent labeling for CD8 was carried out to prove the co-localization between miR-765 and CD8+ T cells. Exosomes derived from CD45RO-CD8+ T cells were isolated to detect the regulatory effects on UCEC. Results: miR-765 is characterized as the most downregulated miRNA in UCEC, and there is a negative correlation between miR-765 and Proteolipid protein 2 (PLP2) in UCEC lesion. Estrogen significantly down-regulates miR-765 level, and facilitates the development of UCEC by estrogen receptor (ER) β. Mechanistically, this process is mediated through the miRNAs (e.g., miR-3584-5p, miR-7-5p, miR-150-5p, and miR-124-3p) cluster-controlled regulation of the PLP2, which further regulates Ki-67 and multiple epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecules (e.g, E-cadherin and Vimentin) in a Notch signaling pathway-dependent manner. Interestingly, the selective ER degrader Fulvestrant alleviates estrogen-mediated miR-765/PLP2 expression regulation and UCEC development in ERβ-dependent and -independent manners. Additionally, CD45RO-CD8+ T cell-derived exosomes release more miR-765 than that from CD45RO+CD8+ T cells. In therapeutic studies, these exosomes limit estrogen-driven disease development via regulation of the miR-765/PLP2 axis. Conclusions: This observation reveals novel molecular mechanisms underlying estrogen signaling and CD8+ T cell-released exosomes in UCEC development, and provides a potential therapeutic strategy for UCEC patients with aberrant ERβ/miR-765/PLP2/Notch signaling axis. © The author(s).},

	abstract = {In the world agriculture, the potatoes acreage tends to decrease, and production increases to 280 million t, i.e. in some countries, the average yield is 30-40 t/ha, which became possible due to the technological progress in agriculture and related industries. However, the potential of biological and economic productivity of the potato remains far unused. In many states, the yield of potatoes remains low, particularly in Russia. Considering potato yield in the Russian Federation, we can state that in the southern areas, due to the climatic conditions, this indicator leaves much to be desired. Due to the hot summer and the high infectious background of viral disease carriers, the seed qualities of prime reproductions degenerate rapidly. All this obliges searching for the best variants of cleaning seed tubers from viral, viroid and mycoplasmal diseases. The lack of high quality planting material, untimely varietal updating, introduction of non-adaptive varieties result in a decreased productivity of the crop and obtaining low yields of tubers with fragile immune system. In this regard, creating potato varieties that are resistant to biotic and abiotic factors of the environment adapted to the conditions of cultivation and ecologically plastic remains an importanttaskof all breeding programs. According to the results of scientific research work (SRW), samples of potatoes that were adaptive to the conditions of the mountains and foothills have been annually taken as donors for future hybridization and creating new immune varieties, based on studying their varietal peculiarities in a collection nursery, and identifying their dominant characteristics. Sources of the main signs that correlate with productivity and resistance to diseases have been detected, which correspond to the created models of varieties for various environmental conditions of mountains and foothills of the North Caucasus region. The maximum attention has been paid to table varieties, and to their resistance to late blight, heat and drought. Individual elements of innovative technologies ofcultivating seed and food potatoes of the most promising varieties and hybrids of Russian and foreign selection have been proposed. Source material has been created, which has been gathered by the complex of valuable economic and biologic features. Parameters of growing sprouts have been justified for various planting schemes, and temperature regimes in the conditions of artificial lighting. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

The species distribution patterns across the families were unequal, with half of the species contributed by 12 families, 5 families with 2-3 members, and 31 families were monotypic. In terms of the functional trait diversity, herbaceous and perennial woody forms were dominant over the other forms. Out of 90 plant species, 10% were used as single usage, 27% double usage and 63% multi-usage. PAST software, a multivariate ecological community analysis software, was used to find the relationship between ethnobotanical usage and plant species. Four plant usages (clusters) were determined at a vertical distance value of 0.5, where the clusters are distinctly separated. The present study will provide a baseline data for the future researchers, policymakers, common public, land managers and other stakeholders to develop scientifically informed strategies for conservation of natural resources and sustainable use of plant diversity in hotspot regions like Himalayas and other similar biodiversity-rich sites elsewhere in the world. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

	abstract = {Increasing soil pollution all over the world has instigated global concerns as enormous quantities of toxic chemicals and heavy metals like cadmium, lead, mercury, petrochemicals, insecticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and chlorophenols are finding their way into the environment, affecting the land and soil, causing soil pollution and thus posing a threat and menace to health and well-being of people and ecosystem. The ubiquitous dissemination, low bioavailability, high perseverance of contaminants like poly-hydrocarbon and metals in soil have the potentially destructive effects to human health, envisages to study the biodegradation of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and PACs (polycyclic aromatic compounds). The diversity of micro-organisms that diminish the PAHs/PACs can be utilized in the advancement of bioremediation techniques. The role of metal-tolerant, (PAH)-degrading bacteria helps in the biodegradation of organic compounds at miscellaneous polluted sites. The isolation of (PAHs)-degrading bacteria from contaminated soil samples collected from garages and petrol pumps of Delhi and NCR region was carried out in the present study. Also, the bacterial samples were tested for the tolerance towards 4 heavy metals-arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg). Morphological studies and biochemical tests were conducted to find the genera of the bacterial samples. The study indicates that hydrocarbons were degraded by the isolates P1, P2, P4, P5, P5*, G1, G3. These isolates were also found to be tolerant at a high concentration of metals (Arsenic, Cadmium, Mercury, and Lead) as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was also calculated. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was tested against various antibiotics. Thus the study suggests that the isolates identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae are not only PAH-degrading but metal-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant too and are of immense potential for bioremediation of contaminated soils. © International Journal of Research in Pharmaceutical Sciences.},

	abstract = {Plant-herbivore interactions shape community dynamics across marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. From amphipods to elephants and from algae to trees, plant-herbivore relationships are the crucial link generating animal biomass (and human societies) from mere sunlight. These interactions are, thus, pivotal to understanding the ecology and evolution of virtually any ecosystem. Here, we briefly highlight recent advances in four areas of plant-herbivore interactions: (1) plant defense theory, (2) herbivore diversity and ecosystem function, (3) predation risk aversion and herbivory, and (4) how a changing climate impacts plant-herbivore interactions. Recent advances in plant defense theory, for example, highlight how plant life history and defense traits affect and are affected by multiple drivers, including enemy pressure, resource availability, and the local plant neighborhood, resulting in trait-mediated feedback loops linking trophic interactions with ecosystem nutrient dynamics. Similarly, although the positive effect of consumer diversity on ecosystem function has long been recognized, recent advances using DNA barcoding to elucidate diet, and Global Positioning System/remote sensing to determine habitat selection and impact, have shown that herbivore communities are probably even more functionally diverse than currently realized. Moreover, although most diversity-function studies continue to emphasize plant diversity, herbivore diversity may have even stronger impacts on ecosystem multifunctionality. Recent studies also highlight the role of risk in plant-herbivore interactions, and risk-driven trophic cascades have emerged as landscape-scale patterns in a variety of ecosystems. Perhaps not surprisingly, many plant-herbivore interactions are currently being altered by climate change, which affects plant growth rates and resource allocation, expression of chemical defenses, plant phenology, and herbivore metabolism and behavior. Finally, we conclude by noting that although the field is advancing rapidly, the world is changing even more rapidly, challenging our ability to manage these pivotal links in the food chain. © 2017 Burkepile DE and Parker JD.},

The experiment developed with the design of complete random sections as a global experiment with three replicates. The first factor included irrigating factors (irrigations 3, 6, 9) day and spray agent with Abyssic acid at concentrations (0, 3, 6) mg/ L and the third agent mixing polymers with soil, Soil mixed with polymers (0.5 kg/ m2) with a depth of 20 cm. The results showed that the increase in the duration of the irrigation period to 9 days resulted in a decrease in the characteristics of the study (dry weight, chlorophyll content, relative water content in leaves) and a clear increase in the percentage of water deficit in the soil while irrigation every 3 days significantly exceeded the studied traits. The results showed that spraying plants with Abyssic acid and its different concentrations, especially 6 mg/ L, led to a clear increase in the traits studied. Mixing the soil with polymers has led to a marked improvement in the studied indicators and increased plant resistance to water scarcity. Interaction factors between the duration of irrigation with alfalfa and the addition of soil polymers showed a significant effect on most studied traits. © 2018 Pharmascope Publications.

Genetic improvement of cassava is required to meet changing farmer and consumer needs, evolving pests and diseases, and challenges presented by climate change. Transgenic and genome editing technologies offer significant potential for introducing desired traits into farmer-preferred varieties and breeding lines, and for studying the biology of this under-investigated crop species. A bottleneck in implementing genetic modification in this species has been access to robust methods for transformation of cassava cultivars and landraces. In this article, we provide a detailed protocol for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cassava and regeneration of genetically modified plants. Basic Protocol 1 describes how to establish and micropropagate in vitro cassava plantlets, and Alternate Protocol 1 details how to establish in vitro cultures from field or greenhouse cuttings. Basic Protocol 2 describes all steps necessary for genetic transformation in the model variety 60444, and Alternate Protocol 2 provides details for modifying this method for use with other cultivars. Finally, Basic Protocol 3 describes how to establish plants produced via Basic Protocol 2 and Alternate Protocol 2 in soil in a greenhouse. These methods have proven applications across more than a dozen genotypes and are capable of producing transgenic and gene-edited plants for experimental purposes, for testing under greenhouse and field conditions, and for development of plants suitable for subsequent regulatory approval and product deployment. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Aims: DEAD-box helicase 1 (DDX1) has oncogenic properties in several human cancers. However, the clinical significance and biological role of DDX1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain elusive. Here, we examined the chemotherapeutic relevance of DDX1 in NSCLC. Main methods: We used the UALCAN database, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical and RT-qPCR assays to assess DDX1 expression in NSCLC cell lines (H1650 and A549) and patient tissues. The role of DDX1 in the chemosensitivity of NSCLC cells and the underlying mechanisms were determined using colony formation, CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing, Transwell, tumor sphere formation, and immunostaining assays, together with a xenograft tumor model in nude mice. Key findings: Our study revealed that DDX1 was overexpressed in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. We further found that depleting DDX1 increased the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the chemotherapy drug cisplatin, increased cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell migration and invasion. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that DDX1 bound to ADAR1, and increased ADAR1 protein expression. Furthermore, we found that ADAR1 mediated cancer-promoting effects, independent of deaminase activity, by binding to RAC3 mRNA. Our findings not only show that DDX1 mediates chemosensitivity to cisplatin via the ADAR1/RAC3 axis but also highlight the importance of ADARs as essential RNA-binding proteins for cell homeostasis, as well as cancer progression. Significance: Our results suggest that DDX1 plays an important role in the development and progression of human NSCLC and that DDX1 may serve as a therapeutic target in NSCLC patients. © 2023},

	abstract = {There are great concerns about the impacts of soil biodiversity loss on ecosystem functions and services such as nutrient cycling, food production, and carbon storage. A diverse community of soil organisms that together comprise a complex food web mediates such ecosystem functions and services. Recent advances have shed light on the key drivers of soil food web structure, but a conceptual integration is lacking. Here, we explore how human-induced changes in plant community composition influence soil food webs. We present a framework describing the mechanistic underpinnings of how shifts in plant litter and root traits and microclimatic variables impact on the diversity, structure, and function of the soil food web. We then illustrate our framework by discussing how shifts in plant communities resulting from land-use change, climatic change, and species invasions affect soil food web structure and functioning. We argue that unravelling the mechanistic links between plant community trait composition and soil food webs is essential to understanding the cascading effects of anthropogenic shifts in plant communities on ecosystem functions and services. © 2018 Kardol P and De Long JR.},

All stages of hybridization between parents were done in 2014 season and all genotypes (parents and their crosses) were grown in 2015 season under normal and drought conditions to study some morphological traits, while genetic analysis were done using half diallel analysis (Griffing technique, mode 1, method 2) to study genetic parameters namely., heterosis over better-parent, combining ability effects with both types besides estimating for drought tolerance indices for five parents of wheat. On the other side of the study, The comparison between the five genotypes of wheat was done using six Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers namely, OPA-2, OPA-4, OPB-14, OPC-5, OPC-12 and OPA-1, respectively. The results showed that the genotypes; Sakha 8 and Sakha 94, Sakha 8 X Sakha 93, Sakha 8 X Sakha 94 and Sakha 8 X Shandweel were the most superior in resisting water stress measuring morphological traits and were different from each other using (RAPD) primers, where six primers detected 68 bands, 29 of them was monomorphic bands and 39 bands were polymorphic and the polymorphism % was 57.35 %. Cluster analysis showed that high diversity observed between the ten genotypes and divided them into two main clusters, where, the first one including (H4, H5) and the second group including (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, H1, H2, H3), respectively. Cluster analysis showed that the similarity ranged from (58.9 to 96.0 %), where the lowest similarity was (58.9 %) between P3 and H5, while the highest value was (96.0 %) among H1 and H2, respectively.},

	abstract = {Drought is the most important environmental stress affecting agricultural productivity worldwide. Breeding of drought-tolerant crops is important in order to meet demands of food security in the face of an ever increasing world population, global warming and water shortage. Drought resistance (DR) is defined as the mechanism causing minimum loss of yield in a water deficit environment relative to the maximum yield in a water constraint free management of the crop. Plants have evolved several mechanisms to cope with water deficit stress which includes drought escape and drought tolerance. Plant breeders and physiologists have identified some important traits associated with DR in crop plants. Many of these traits relate to making appropriate use of water when it is available, often with the aim of ensuring reproductive success and grain yield. Traits associated with DR serve as important breeding tools in identifying stress-resistant genotypes and in introgressing the resistance traits into high yielding genotypes. Marker-assisted selection based around screening for desirable alleles at QTL for DR is an important approach for improving DR in crops. Dissecting these complex phenotypic traits into simpler heritable traits has led to the identification of genes associated with some QTLs for DR. Breeding for DR has met with limited success following either empirical or marker-assisted selection approach. It is essential to integrate crop physiology, functional genomics and breeding approaches to dissect complex DR traits, understand the molecular basis of DR and develop improved cultivars to adapt to the changing climate. This chapter focuses on the DR traits important for agricultural productivity in major crops, i.e. wheat and rice. The physiological and genetic basis of traits is discussed to highlight the complexity of the quantitative traits and the need to integrate this information in breeding drought-resistant crops. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

In this study, we present a web-resource containing information on NtUE-related genes/QTLs and the corresponding available microRNAs for some of these genes in four major cereal crops (wheat ( Triticum aestivum), rice ( Oryza sativa), maize ( Zea mays), barley ( Hordeum vulgare)), two alien species related to wheat ( Triticum urartu and Aegilops tauschii), and two model species ( Brachypodium distachyon and Arabidopsis thaliana). Gene annotations integrated in the current web resource were manually curated from the existing databases and the available literature. The primary goal of developing this web resource is to provide descriptions of the NtUE-related genes and their functional annotation. MicroRNAs targeting some of the NtUE related genes and the QTLs for NtUE-related traits are also included.

BC has a high purity with no lignin, pectin, and hemicellulose commonly found in plant cellulose and also has a high degree of crystallinity so that the microfiber contained in it is tightly bound together and forms robust and elastic webbing. This study aims to provide a face mask sheet, wherein the sheets are made from BC, which is obtained from the fermentation of coconut water using Acetobacter xylinum. The plant extracts used were green tea leaf extract (Camellia sinensis), roselle flower petals (Hibiscus sabdariffa), and Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L. flower extract (a red and pink variant of color). The antioxidant assay using the DPPH test for the BC with plant extracts was evaluated. The result showed that the highest antioxidant activity was owned by BC green tea extract (IC50 80.9 ppm), followed by BC red hibiscus extract (IC50 438.8 ppm), BC roselle extract (IC50 505.1 ppm), and BC pink hibiscus extract (IC50 1015 ppm). Antibacterial testing was carried out using Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The growth of bacteria incubated in BC extract with 37oC for 24 hours was carried out by optical density reading (OD) at 600 nm with ELISA microplate reader. The results obtained showed that, with extract concentrations between 125 and 500 ppm, BC roselle extract had the highest inhibitory activity against P. aeruginosa and E. coli. The BC plant extracts were also characterized using SEM, FTIR, and X-ray diffraction technique for their morphological structure, functional groups, and crystallinity. This result showed that BC with the addition of plant extracts is a promising candidate for mask sheet application with natural antioxidant and antibacterial activity. © 2020 Hanna Ivanivna Severina et al.},

The results showed that EN inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner by MTT method and colony forming assay. MCF-7 cells treated with EN showed typical characteristics of apoptosis including the morphological changes and DNA fragmentation. Meanwhile, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was showed by flow cytometry. In addition, western blot analysis showed that EN resulted in the decrease expression of procaspase-3, procaspase-9 and bcl-2.

	abstract = {Background: Plants differ in their ability to cope with external stresses (e.g., drought tolerance). Genome duplications are an important mechanism to enable plant adaptation. This leads to characteristic footprints in the genome, such as protein family expansion. We explore genetic diversity and uncover evolutionary adaptation to stresses by exploiting genome comparisons between stress tolerant and sensitive species and RNA-Seq data sets from stress experiments. Expanded gene families that are stress-responsive based on differential expression analysis could hint at species or clade-specific adaptation, making these gene families exciting candidates for follow-up tolerance studies and crop improvement. Software: Integration of such cross-species omics data is a challenging task, requiring various steps of transformation and filtering. Ultimately, visualization is crucial for quality control and interpretation. To address this, we developed A2TEA: Automated Assessment of Trait-specific Evolutionary Adaptations, a Snakemake workflow for detecting adaptation footprints in silico. It functions as a one-stop processing pipeline, integrating protein family, phylogeny, expression, and protein function analysis. The pipeline is accompanied by an R Shiny web application that allows exploring, highlighting, and exporting the results interactively. This allows the user to formulate hypotheses regarding the genomic adaptations of one or a subset of the investigated species to a given stress. Conclusions: While our research focus is on crops, the pipeline is entirely independent of the underlying species and can be used with any set of species. We demonstrate pipeline efficiency on real-world datasets and discuss the implementation and limits of our analysis workflow as well as planned extensions to its current state.

	abstract = {During embryonic development, changes in the cardiovascular microstructure and material properties are essential for an integrated biomechanical understanding. This knowledge also enables realistic predictive computational tools, specifically targeting the formation of congenital heart defects. Material characterization of cardiovascular embryonic tissue at consequent embryonic stages is critical to understand growth, remodeling, and hemodynamic functions. Two biomechanical loading modes, which are wall shear stress and blood pressure, are associated with distinct molecular pathways and govern vascular morphology through microstructural remodeling. Dynamic embryonic tissues have complex signaling networks integrated with mechanical factors such as stress, strain, and stiffness. While the multiscale interplay between the mechanical loading modes and microstructural changes has been studied in animal models, mechanical characterization of early embryonic cardiovascular tissue is challenging due to the miniature sample sizes and active/passive vascular components. Ac-cordingly, this comparative review focuses on the embryonic material characterization of developing cardiovascular systems and attempts to classify it for different species and embryonic timepoints. Key cardiovascular components including the great vessels, ventricles, heart valves, and the umbilical cord arteries are covered. A state-of-the-art review of experimental techniques for embryonic material characterization is provided along with the two novel methods developed to measure the residual and von Mises stress distributions in avian embryonic vessels noninvasively, for the first time in the literature. As attempted in this review, the compilation of embryonic mechanical properties will also contribute to our understanding of the mature cardiovascular system and possibly lead to new microstructural and genetic interventions to correct abnormal development. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Agronomic traits of plants especially those of economic or aesthetic importance are threatened by climatic and environmental factors such as climate change, biotic, and abiotic stresses. These threats are now being mitigated through the analyses of omics data like genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics. The emergence of high-throughput omics technology has led to an avalanche of plant omics data. Plant research demands novel analytical paradigms to extract and harness large plant omics data for plant improvement effectively and efficiently. Machine learning algorithms are well-suited analytical and computational approaches for the integrative analysis of large unstructured, heterogeneous datasets. This study presents an overview of omics approaches to improve plant agronomic traits and crucial curated plant genomic data sources. Furthermore, we summarize machine learning algorithms and software tools/programming packages used in plant omics research. Lastly, we discuss advancements in machine learning algorithms' applications in improving agronomic traits of economically important plants. Extensive application of machine learning would advance plant omics studies. These advancements would consequently help agricultural scientists improve economically important plants’ quality, yield, and tolerance against abiotic and biotic stresses and other plant health-threatening issues.

	abstract = {Owning multiple pharmaceutical functions, plant-derived tropane alkaloids, especially scopolamine, have been widely used in medicine. Significant progress has been made in the production of tropane alkaloids during the past decades via breeding and cultivation of Duboisia cultivates, which are rich in scopolamine. However, unpredicted effects of environmental conditions and the progressive impact of global climate change are two major challenges for sustainable production of these compounds in the near future. In vitro cultures offer a powerful alternative source of TA production which address the uncontrolled effects of environmental variables under field cultivation and most importantly ease manipulation of the culture systems to maximize productivity. However, low quality or quantity of certain TA is still one of the biggest challenges that limit applicability of in vitro cultures. As an evolutionary phenomenon, polyploidy has been known to impact almost all characteristics of a plant species including pharmaceutically important traits such as biomass production and secondary metabolism. However, application of polyploidy has been underestimated and unexplored in production of tropane alkaloids. Here, we review recent progresses in the application of polyploidy in improving the quantity and quality of TA production in plants and in vitro cultures of TA-producing plant species. We also discuss the future directions of the polyploidy research in this field. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

The results show that elevated levels of CO2 increased shoot biomass more, compared to root biomass, but decreased Cd concentrations in all plant tissues. Cd exposure caused toxicity to both Lolium species, as shown by the restrictions of the root morphological parameters including root length, surface area, volume, and tip numbers. These parameters were significantly higher under elevated levels of CO2 than under ambient CO2, especially for the number of fine roots. The increases in magnitudes of those parameters triggered by elevated levels of CO2 under Cd stress were more than those under non-Cd stress, suggesting an ameliorated Cd stress under elevated levels of CO2. The total Cd uptake per pot, calculated on the basis of biomass, was significantly greater under elevated levels of CO2 than under ambient CO 2. Ameliorated Cd toxicity, decreased Cd concentration, and altered root morphological traits in both Lolium species under elevated levels of CO2 may have implications in food safety and phytoremediation. © 2011 Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Projections for freshwater ecosystems include severe alterations with gradients across geographical areas. Life traits in bacteria are modulated by environmental parameters, but there is still uncertainty regarding bacterial responses to changes caused by climatic alterations. In this study, we used a river water microcosm model to evaluate how Aeromonas spp., an important pathogenic and zoonotic genus ubiquitary in aquatic ecosystems, responds to environmental variations of temperature and pH as expected by future projections. Namely, we evaluated bacterial growth, biofilm production and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Aeromonas species in pure and mixed cultures. Biofilm production was significantly influenced by temperature and culture, while temperature and pH affected bacterial growth. Reversion of antimicrobial susceptibility status occurred in the majority of strains and tested antimicrobial compounds, with several combinations of temperature and pH contributing to this effect. Current results highlight the consequences that bacterial genus such as Aeromonas will experience with climatic alterations, specifically how their proliferation and virulence and phenotypic resistance expression will be modulated. Such information is fundamental to predict and prevent future outbreaks and deleterious effects that these bacterial species might have in human and animal populations. © 2021 by the authors.

Integrated analysis of transcriptome and metabolome profiling demonstrated that IiWRKY34 expression had far-reaching consequences on both primary and secondary metabolism, reprograming carbon flux towards phenylpropanoids, such as lignans and flavonoids. Transcript–metabolite correlation analysis was applied to construct the regulatory network of IiWRKY34 for lignan biosynthesis. One candidate target Ii4CL3, a key rate-limiting enzyme of lignan biosynthesis as indicated in our previous study, has been demonstrated to indeed be activated by IiWRKY34.

	abstract = {Exposure to the nerve agent soman, an irreversible cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitor, results in changes in blood-brain barrier permeability attributed to its seizure-induced activity. However, smaller BBB changes may be independent of convulsions. Such minor injury may escape detection. A nonneuroinvasive neurovirulent Sindbis virus strain (SVN) was used as a marker for BBB permeability. Peripheral inoculation of mice with 2×103 plaque forming units (PFU) caused up to 105 PFU/ml viremia after 24 hours with no signs of central nervous system (CNS) infection and with no virus detected in brain tissue. Intra-cerebral injection of as low as 1-5 PFU of the same virus caused CNS infection, exhibited 5-7 days later as hind limb paralysis and death. Soman (0.1-0.7 of the LD50,) was administered at peak viremia (1 day following peripheral inoculation). Sublethal soman exposure at as low as 0.1LD50 resulted in CNS infection 6-8 days following inoculation in 30-40% of the mice. High virus titer were recorded in brain tissue of sick mice while no virus was detected in healthy mice subjected to the same treatment. No changes in the level of viremia or changes in viral traits were observed in the infected mice. The reversible anticholinesterases physostigmine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and pyridostigmine (0.4 mg/kg, i.m.) injected at a dose equal to 0.1LD50 induced similar results. Thus, both central and peripheral anticholinesterases (anti-ChEs) induce changes in BBB permeability sufficient to allow, at least in some of the mice, the invasion of this otherwise noninvasive but highly neurovirulent virus. This BBB change is probably due to the presence of cholinesterases in the capillary wall. SVN brain invasion served here as a highly sensitive and reliable marker for BBB integrity. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

	abstract = {                             Simultaneous C−N, and N−N bond-forming methods for one-pot transformations are highly challenging in synthetic organic chemistry. In this study, the Cu                             2                             O rhombic dodecahedra-catalyzed synthesis of 2H-indazoles is demonstrated with good to excellent yields from readily available chemicals. This one-pot procedure involves Cu                             2                             O nanoparticle-catalyzed consecutive C−N, and N−N bond formation followed by cyclization to yield 2H-indazoles with broad substrate scope and high functional group tolerance. Various cell-based bioassay studies demonstrated that 2H-indazoles inhibit the growth of cancer cells, typically through induction of apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, 2H-indazoles tested in the MDA-MB-468 cell line were capable of inhibiting cancer cell migration and invasion. Thus, it is shown that 2H-indazoles have potent in vitro anticancer activity that warrant further investigation of this compound class.                          © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The 21 F1 hybrids and one standard check variety (single cross Giza 10) were evaluated in the next season 2015 under two levels of irrigation i.e., normal and water stress conditions. General and specific combining ability effects were estimated according to (Griffing, 1956), model 1 method 4. Genetic diversity in a tested maize genotypes at molecular level were also assessed using five Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) primers. The six traits studied were ear length, ear diameter, number of rows /ear, No. of kernels/ row, 100 kernel weight, and grain yield /plant. Results displayed that seven crosses ; (P1 X P2, P1 X P6, P1 X P7, P2 X P6, P2 X P7, P4 X P5, P6 X P7) exhibited the most desirable mean values, revealed significant and highly significant positively values of standard heterosis for all traits studied compared with the check variety (Giza 10) beside the significant and highly significant positively data of general and specific combining ability effects under all conditions, in addition to superiority and endurance it has achieved using tolerance indices. The parental line P2 is the best general combiner showing significant desirable GCA effects for the most studied traits under normal and water stress conditions. Significant and highly significant positively of correlation coefficients were showed between ear length and the rest of traits studied under all conditions except the correlation between ear length and ear diameter under water stress conditions where it was negatively correlated, respectively. The genetic diversity using inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) technique through using five primers for the seven lines of maize was employed giving a total of 23 fragments, where 14 of them were polymorphic bands with 60.86 % polymorphism and 9 fragments was monomorphic bands, respectively.},

	abstract = {Copper-derived compounds are often used in olive tree farms. In a previous study, a collection of bacterial strains isolated from olive tree farms were identified and tested for phenotypic antimicrobial resistance and heavy metal tolerance. The aim of this work was to study the genetic determinants of resistance and to evaluate the co-occurrence of metal tolerance and antibiotic resistance genes. Both metal tolerance and antibiotic resistance genes (including beta-lactamase genes) were detected in the bacterial strains from Cu-treated soils. A high percentage of the strains positive for metal tolerance genes also carried antibiotic resistance genes, especially for genes involved in resistances to beta-lactams and tetracycline. Significant associations were detected between genes involved in copper tolerance and genes coding for beta-lactamases or tetracycline resistance mechanisms. A significant association was also detected between zntA (coding for a Zn(II)-translocating P-type ATPase) and tetC genes. In conclusion, bacteria from soils of Cu-treated olive farms may carry both metal tolerance and antibiotic resistance genes. The positive associations detected between metal tolerance genes and antibiotic resistance genes suggests co-selection of such genetic traits by exposure to metals. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Breast cancer, a most common cancer in the women worldwide representing about quarter (25%) of all cancers. The predictions of cancer prevalence show an imperative need for strengthening the present diagnostic/treatment facilities. One such strategy to overcome the treatment burden for the breast cancer is drug repurposing/repositioning. This concept has been growing its importance, the very reason behind this is it decreases significantly the funds needed for the development of therapy for a disease and it increases the chances of the new indications from Phase I to entry in the market. The objective of the study was to evaluated the morphological characteristic, migration features of the cells and cell cycle arrest of the anti-HSV drug Acyclovir against breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB231. The in vitro cytotoxicity studies, fragmentation assay, long term clonogenic assay and cell cycle analysis were carried out in the study. In MTT assay acyclovir showed IC50 of 3.16 ± 1.10µg/ml and 3.85 ± 1.54µg/ml respectively with SI of 33.46 tested against MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cell lines. The platting efficiency was found to be 52.30 % by clonogenic assay. One of the indications of cell death by apoptosis is accumulation of cells in G2/M phase which was observed with Acyclovir in cell cycle analysis. The study showed that Acyclovir inhibited cancer cells propagation, colony formation ability and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, while having no effect on the normal cells. These results indicated new insights on the effect of anti-HSV agents on the tumorigenesis and metastasis. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Proteus species especially Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris are zoonotic pathogens often associated with drug resistance traits. They are of public health importance with zoonotic status. They have been globally associated with humans and poultry infections. Multidrug resistant strains of these organisms are routinely isolated from organs samples from carcasses of birds submitted for bacteriological diagnostic process in Nigeria with little or no information on their access route to poultry. The uncontrolled close association of rats with poultry and other materials involved with poultry production in Nigeria, informed screening of 22 Proteus mirabilis and 1 Proteus vulgaris isolates from poultry houses rats, identified by standard methods. The isolates were further confirmed with Oxoid Microbact GNB 24E® (MB24E) and accompanying computer software package (Oxoid Microbact®) 2000 version 2.03 and by 16S ribosomal RNA PCR identification procedure. Their susceptibilities to 10 commonly used antibiotics using standard methods. Subsequently, the fluoroquinolone resistant isolates were PCR screened for point mutation at the gyrA of the quinolone resistant determining region. All the 23 isolates were multi-drug resistant, with 100% resistance to 6/10 of the antibiotics examined including: ceftazidime, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, ampicillin and streptomycin. One of the 9, high fluoroquinolone resistant isolates MICs ranges 64µg/mL - >128µg/mL displayed 6 point mutations. This work identified rats as the possible source of multidrug resistant Proteus species for poultry in Nigeria. It also exposes the potential public health risk of the rats transmission of drug resistant factors through the pathogens to humans involved with poultry production in the study area. © 2016, Ibadan Biomedical Communications Group.

Methods; By consulting ancient books and combining modern technology and methods, the washing, moisturizing, cutting, drying and other processes were optimized to obtain angelica tablets. The dosage and moistening time of Chinese angelica yellow wine were optimized through single factor investigation.combining "gentel fire dry" operation key points, three processing parameters, i. e., frying temperature, frying time and frying speed, were observed by L, (3) orthogonal experiment. Taking traits, moisture (%), extract (%) and ferulic acid content (%) as the inspection indicators, the entropy weight method is used to calculate the composite score, and the processing technology of distilled angelica is optimized. The fingerprint of Danggui decoction pieces was established by HPLC using Techmate C18 column (250 mm x 4. 6 mm, 5 |j,m), and acetonitrile (A)-0.2% phosphoric acid water (B) was used as the mobile phase system for gradient elution. The detection wavelength was set at 280 nm, the column temperature was 30 t, the flow rate was 1.0 mL-Min. Results; The best processing method of Angelicae sinensis Radix processed with yellow wine and the HPLC fingerprint of decoction pieces of Angelicae sinensis Radix processed with yellow wine were established, and 4 main common peaks were identified, namely chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, ligustilide, and ligustalide I. The content determination methods of the four components were established.

Mammalian DGKs distribute into five subfamilies that regulate local availability of DAG and PA pools in a tissue- and subcellular-restricted manner. Pharmacological manipulation of DGK activity holds great promise, given the critical contribution of specific DGK subtypes to the control of membrane structure, signaling complexes, and cell-cell communication. The latest advances in the DGK field have unveiled the differential contribution of selected isoforms to human disease. Defects in the expression/activity of individual DGK isoforms contribute substantially to cognitive impairment, mental disorders, insulin resistance, and vascular pathologies. Abnormal DGK overexpression, on the other hand, confers the acquisition of malignant traits including invasion, chemotherapy resistance, and inhibition of immune attack on tumors. Translation of these findings into therapeutic approaches will require development of methods to pharmacologically modulate DGK functions. In particular, inhibitors that target the DGKα isoform hold particular promise in the fight against cancer, on their own or in combination with immune-targeting therapies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Probiotics have attained significant interest in recent years as a result of their gut microbiome modulation and gastrointestinal health benefits. Numerous fermented foods contain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which are considered as GRAS and probiotic bacteria. The present study aimed to investigate indigenous LAB from homemade fermented mil k samples collected in remote areas of Kar nat aka (India), in order to isolate the most potent and well-adapted to local environmental conditions bacteria, which were then evaluated using a step-by-step approach focused on the evaluation of probiotic traits and β-galactosidase-producing ability. LAB were screened using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indole-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) and O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopy ranoside (ONPG) as substrate, and exhibited β-galactosidase activity ranging from 728.25 to 1,203.32 Miller units. The most promising isolates were selected for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and identified as Lactiplantibacillus plan-tarum, Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lactiplantibacillus pentosus and Lactiplantibacillus sp. Furthermore, these isolates were evaluated by in vitro, viz., survival in gastrointestinal tract, antibiotic susceptibility, antimicrobial activity, cell surface characteristics, and haemolytic activity. All eight isolates demonstrated strong adherence and prevented pathogen penetration into HT-29 cells, indicating potential of the bacteria to scale up industrial level production of milk products for lactose intolerants. © 2023, Spandidos Publications.

	abstract = {Industrial wastes with hazardous dyes serve as a major source of water pollution, which is considered to have an enormous impact on public health. In this study, an eco-friendly adsorbent, the porous siliceous frustules extracted from the diatom species Halamphora cf. salinicola, grown under laboratory conditions, has been identified. The porous architecture and negative surface charge under a pH of 7, provided by the various functional groups via Si–O, N–H, and O–H on these surfaces, revealed by SEM, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, Zeta-potential measurement, and ATR-FTIR, respectively, made the frustules an efficient mean of removal of the diazo and basic dyes from the aqueous solutions, 74.9%, 94.02%, and 99.81% against Congo Red (CR), Crystal Violet (CV), and Malachite Green (MG), respectively. The maximum adsorption capacities were calculated from isotherms, as follows: 13.04 mg g−1, 41.97 mg g−1, and 33.19 mg g−1 against CR, CV, and MG, respectively. Kinetic and isotherm models showed a higher correlation to Pore diffusion and Sips models for CR, and Pseudo-Second Order and Freundlich models for CV and MG. Therefore, the cleaned frustules of the thermal spring-originated diatom strain Halamphora cf. salinicola could be used as a novel adsorbent of a biological origin against anionic and basic dyes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Fifteen selected genotypes of prickly oil lettuce were assessed for genetic variation (variability, heritability and genetic advance) and molecular characterization of RAPD markers. Significant variation were detected for all studied characters among genotypes. High phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variation values were observed for seed weight, oil yield per plant, and number of main branches per plant. Most of the traits exhibited a high heritability value. High genetic advance coupled with high heritability was observed for oil percent, plant height and seed weight. RAPD analyses showed 43 DNA bands scored by the 6 primers used. These bands were identified as 18 polymorphic and 25 monomorphic ones with 41.8% polymorphism. The dendrogram of the 10 selected genotypes were divided into two main groups. The first one comprises 5 selected genotypes, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, while the second one includes the other five selected genotypes. These results suggested that, assessment of genetic variation parameters and RAPD markers is helpful for possible distinguishing, identifying, characterizing, and selection processing of genotypes of prickly oil lettuce. © 2010 RJPBCS.},

The results showed as following: ① Under the light and temperature interactive treatments,total germination percentage( TGP) was restrained by high temperature and continuous light also decreased TGP under high temperature. Mean germination time( MGT) was not changed by light mode. Root development was enhanced by dark and low temperature. Shoot development was enhanced by light and high temperature. Hypocotyl length was enhanced by dark and high temperature. ② Under the light and temperature interactive treatments combined respectively with PEG and NaCl stress conditions,although the inhibitions of seed germination and growth were gradually strengthened with the increases of osmotic stresses,slight osmotic stress can promote seed germination. Under the same osmotic potential,the effects of PEG on TGPs and MGTs were stronger than that of NaCl. As the temperature increase,the seeds may change from photo-neutrality to photo-phobia. Decreased TGP under drought and continuous light interactive treatment is an adaptation strategy to avoiding drought. Hypocotyl growth accelerated under continuous dark treatment is an ecological trait which could increase dry matter input in stem and height for more light. Seed development under high concentration of NaCl treatment is better than that of PEG treatment due to low water potential caused by Na~+,which can enter into seed coat and promote water absorption.},

	abstract = {Heat stress as a yield limiting issue has become a major threat for food security as global warming progresses. Being sessile, plants cannot avoid heat stress. They respond to heat stress by activating complex molecular networks, such as signal transduction, metabolite production and expressions of heat stress-associated genes. Some plants have developed an intricate signalling network to respond and adapt it. Heat stress tolerance is a polygenic trait, which is regulated by various genes, transcriptional factors, proteins and hormones. Therefore, to improve heat stress tolerance, a sound knowledge of various mechanisms involved in the response to heat stress is required. The classical breeding methods employed to enhance heat stress tolerance has had limited success. In this era of genomics, next generation sequencing techniques, availability of genome sequences and advanced biotechnological tools open several windows of opportunities to improve heat stress tolerance in crop plants. This review discusses the potential of various functional genomic approaches, such as genome wide association studies, microarray, and suppression subtractive hybridization, in the process of discovering novel genes related to heat stress, and their functional validation using both reverse and forward genetic approaches. This review also discusses how these functionally validated genes can be used to improve heat stress tolerance through plant breeding, transgenics and genome editing approaches. © 2019 Singh B et al.},

	abstract = {To study variation trend of growth indices in lentil under drought stress, an experiment was conducted in Ardabil Agricultural Research Station in 2007. The experiment was a split-plot design based on Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD) with four replications. Treatments included three lentil genotypes (Ardabil indigenous genotype, ILL4400 and ILL6212) and four irrigation levels [irrigation on the basis of 60 mm evaporation from basin class A (I1), irrigation on the basis of 80 mm evaporation from basin class A (I2), irrigation on the basis of 100 mm evaporation from basin class A (I3) and no-irrigation (I4)]. Irrigation levels were considered as the main plots and genotypes as the sub-plots. Results showed that among different irrigation levels, ILL4400 had the highest dry weight. ILL6212 had the highest dry matter at irrigation level of I4. At irrigation level of I4, ILL6212 had the highest growth rate and at irrigation level of I1, ILL4400 had the best growth. ILL4400 had higher relative growth rate than other cultivars and it started to decrease with a slow gradient in other cultivars. In the case of phonological traits, Ardabil indigenous genotype had the highest plant height and axillary branch no. at irrigation level of I1. The highest days to flowering and days to maturity was achieved at irrigation level of I1 (i.e. the most frequent irrigation) and among cultivars, Ardabil Indigenous genotype and ILL4400 stood in a same group and ILL6212 flowered in a shorter time so that genotype ILL4400 had the highest yield at irrigation level of I2 and genotype ILL6212 and Ardabil indigenous cultivar stood in the next ranks. And irrigation level of I4 had the lowest yield. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recently, returning straw to the fields has been proved as a direct and effective method to tackle soil nutrient loss and agricultural pollution. Meanwhile, the slow decomposition of straw may harm the growth of the next crop. This study aimed to determine the effects of rumen microorganisms (RMs) on straw decomposition, bacterial microbial community structure, soil properties, and soil enzyme activity. The results showed that RMs significantly enhanced the degradation rate of straw in the soil, reaching 39.52%, which was 41.37% higher than that of the control on the 30th day after straw return. After 30 d, straw degradation showed a significant slower trend in both the control and the experimental groups. According to the soil physicochemical parameters, the application of rumen fluid expedited soil matter transformation and nutrient buildup, and increased the urease, sucrase, and cellulase activity by 10%–20%. The qualitative analysis of straw showed that the hydroxyl functional group structure of cellulose in straw was greatly damaged after the application of rumen fluid. The analysis of soil microbial community structure revealed that the addition of rumen fluid led to the proliferation of Actinobacteria with strong cellulose degradation ability, which was the main reason for the accelerated straw decomposition. Our study highlights that returning rice straw to the fields with rumen fluid inoculation can be used as an effective measure to enhance the biological value of recycled rice straw, proposing a viable solution to the problem of sluggish straw decomposition. © 2023, Zhejiang University Press.},

	abstract = {Chronic discharge of surplus organic matter is a typical side effect of fish aquaculture, occasionally leading to coastal eutrophication and excessive phytoplankton growth. Owing to their innate filter-feeding capacity, marine sponges could mitigate environmental impact under integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) scenarios. Herein, we investigated the clearance capacity of four ubiquitous Mediterranean sponges (Agelas oroides, Axinella cannabina, Chondrosia reniformis and Sarcotragus foetidus) against three microalgal substrates with different size/motility characteristics: the nanophytoplankton Nannochloropsis sp. (~3.2 µm, nonmotile) and Isochrysis sp. (~3.8 µm, motile), as well as the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum (~21.7 µm, nonmotile). In vitro cleaning experiments were conducted using sponge explants in 1 L of natural seawater and applying different microalgal cell concentrations under light/dark conditions. The investigated sponges exhibited a wide range of retention efficiencies for the different phytoplankton cells, with the lowest average values found for A. cannabina (37%) and the highest for A. oroides (70%). The latter could filter up to 14.1 mL seawater per hour and gram of sponge wet weight, by retaining 100% of Isochrysis at a density of 105 cells mL−1, under darkness. Our results highlight differences in filtering capacity among sponge species and preferences for microalgal substrates with distinct size and motility traits. © 2021 by the authors.

Seeds of two T. kirilowii strains were used to research the difference of surface ultrastructure characteristic and drought resistance. Scanning electron microscope was used to identify the surface ultrastructure characteristic of seeds and PEG was used to simulate drought stress. The seeds germination rate, MDA content, chlorophyll content and the antioxidant enzymes activity were measured under the drought stress. The results showed that the seed surface colour of KXY-001 was lighter than that of KXY-005. The testa cobwebbing of KXY-001 was more intensive than that of KXY-005. The germination rate of KXY-001 was higher than that of KXY-005 under drought stress. The MDA content was increased and the chlorophyll content was decreased with the increasing of drought degree. The SOD activity of KXY-001 was higher than that of KXY-005, while the activity of POD and CAT was also increased firstly and decreased later. Surface reticulate of seeds and hilar traits can be used as identification points to identify the investigated strains. SOD and POD are activated to resist drought in T. kirilowii seedlings and the drought resistance of KXY-001 is superior than that of KXY-005.},

It has extensively influenced the healthcare industry not only in China but also in neighboring countries. The use of CHM to treat human diseases, especially cancer, is keep growing. Furthermore, millions of money were invested to study the role of CHM in cancer cure. In the last decade, researchers together with CHM practitioners tried to bridge the gap to understand each other's perspective to find the effectiveness of CHM in treating cancer. The mechanism of CHM in treating cancer is best understood via the theory of cancer hallmark proposed by Hanahan and Weinberg, which describes functional, molecular, and biological traits of specific cancer. The eight hallmarks of cancer are inhibiting proliferative signaling, inducing growth suppressors, inducing cell death, inhibiting replicative immortality, antiangiogenesis, inhibition of invasion and metastasis, energy metabolism, and immune destructive. The information is extracted from electronic resources (PubMed, Wiley, Springer, and ScienceDirect). This article reviews the antitumor activity of CHM against various cancers through each of the eight cancer hallmarks.

	abstract = {The increasingly serious problem of acid rain is leading to increased potassium (K) loss from soils, and in our field investigation, we found that even congenerically relative Mosla species show different tolerance to K-deficiency. A hydroponic study was conducted on the growth of two Mosla species and their morphological, physiological and stoichiometric traits in response to limited (0.35 mmol K/L), normal (3.25 mmol K/L) and excessive (6.50 mmol K/L) K concentrations. Mosla hangchowensis is an endangered plant, whereas Mosla dianthera a widespread weed. In the case of M. hangchowensis, in comparison with normal K concentration, K-limitation induced a significant reduction in net photosynthetic rate (Pn), soluble protein content, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, but an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration. However, leaf mass ratio (LMR) and root mass ratio (RMR) were changed little by K-limitation. In contrast, for M. dianthera, K-limitation had little effect on Pn, soluble protein content, SOD activity, and MDA concentration, but increased LMR and RMR. Critical values of N (nitrogen): K and K:P (phosphorus) ratios in the shoots indicated that limitation in acquiring K occurred under K-limited conditions for M. hangchowensis but not for M. dianthera. We found that low K content in natural habitats was a restrictive factor in the growth and distribution of M. hangchowensis, and soil K-deficiency caused by acid rain worsened the situation of M. hangchowensis, while M. dianthera could well acclimate to the increasing K-deficiency. We suggest that controlling the acid rain and applying K fertilizers may be an effective way to rescue the endangered M. hangchowensis. © Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to characterize the bacterial profiles and their association with selected semen quality traits among two chicken breeds. Thirty Lohmann Brown and thirty ROSS 308 roosters were selected for semen quality estimation, including sperm motility, membrane and acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, and DNA fragmentation. The oxidative profile of the semen, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant capacity, protein, and lipid oxidation, were assessed as well. Moreover, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1, IL-6) and C-reactive protein, as well as the concentrations of selected antibacterial proteins (cathelicidin, β-defensin and lysozyme) in the seminal plasma were evaluated with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The prevailing bacterial genera identified by the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were Citrobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Escherichia spp. and Staphylococcus spp. While the bacterial load was significantly higher in the ROSS 308 line (p < 0.05), a higher number of potentially uropathogenic bacteria was found in the Lohmann Brown roosters. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed a substantial resistance of randomly selected bacterial strains, particularly to ampicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and tobramycin. Furthermore, Lohmann Brown ejaculates containing an increased proportion of Escherichia coli presented with significantly (p < 0.05) elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-6, as well as ROS overproduction and lipid peroxidation. Inversely, significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of β-defensin and lysozyme were found in the semen collected from the ROSS 308 roosters, which was characterized by a higher quality in comparison to the Lohmann Brown roosters. In conclusion, we emphasize the criticality of bacteriospermia in the poultry industry and highlight the need to include a more complex microbiological screening of semen samples designated for artificial insemination. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The preparation of microcellulose from sugarcane pulp enzymatically and its modification with silver nanoparticles had been conducted in this study. The objectives of this research were to prepare and characterize microfiber cellulose, and also its application as an antimicrobial material. Micro cellulose has been prepared by enzymatic methods and then continued with ultrasonication. The characterization of microfiber cellulose has been conducted by determining wavelengths with UV-Vis, functional groups with FTIR, surface image with SEM, and crystallinity with XRD. Synthesis of AgNPs had been conducted by bioreduction method using red betel leaf extracts via ultrasonication and stabilized by 0.05% starch solution. Characterization of silver nanoparticles had been conducted by determination of wavelength with UV-Vis and particle size with PSA. The antimicrobial tests of microcellulose have been determined by measuring of clear zones in Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The characterization of microcellulose showed that wavelengths of micro cellulose at 300 nm, has C-O glycosidic bonds, the C=O, and lignin/hemicellulose. However, C=C lignin aromatic rings begin to disappear. Microcellulose size was 1 μm and crystallinity was 79.05%. The wavelengths in silver nanoparticles were shown at 424 nm. The diameter of silver nanoparticles was 88.6 nm. Micro cellulose with nanoparticle modification was the best in microbial inhibition. © 2022, Rasayan Journal of Chemistry, c/o Dr. Pratima Sharma.

	abstract = {The use of antimicrobials in animal production is under public debate, mainly due to the risk of transfer of resistance to pathogenic bacteria in humans. Therefore, measures have been taken during the last few decades to reduce antibiotic usage in animals, for instance, by national monitoring programmes and by improving animal health management. Although some initiatives exist in molecular genetic selection, quantitative genetic selection of animals towards decreased antibiotic usage is an underexplored area to reduce antibiotic usage. However, this strategy could yield cumulative effects. In this study, we derived new phenotypes from on-farm parenteral antibiotic records from commercially grown crossbred finishing pigs used in the progeny test of Piétrain terminal sires to investigate the heritability of antibiotics usage. Parenteral antibiotic records, production parameters and pedigree records of 2238 full-sib pens from two experimental farms in Belgium between 2014 and 2020 were analysed. Heritability estimates were moderate (18–44%) for phenotypes derived from all antibiotic treatments, and low (1–15%) for phenotypes derived from treatments against respiratory diseases only. Moreover, genetic correlations between these new phenotypes and mortality were low to moderate (0.08–0.60) and no strong adverse genetic correlations with production traits were found. The high heritabilities and favourable genetic correlations suggest these new phenotypes, derived from on-farm antibiotics records, to be promising for inclusion in future pig breeding programs to breed for a decrease in antibiotics usage. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Poultry is the most likely source of livestock-associated Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) and plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC)-producing E. coli (EC) for humans. We tested the hypothesis that farming methods have an impact on the load of ESBL/pAmpC-EC in the gut of broilers at slaughter. Isolates (n = 156) of antibiotic-free (AF), organic (O), and conventional (C) animals were characterized for antibiotic susceptibility and antibiotic resistance genes. Thirteen isolates were whole-genome sequenced. The average loads of ESBL/pAmpC-EC in cecal contents were 4.17 Log CFU/g for AF; 2.85 Log CFU/g for O; and 3.88 Log CFU/g for C type (p < 0.001). ESBL/pAmpC-EC isolates showed resistance to antibiotic classes historically used in poultry, including penicillins, tetracyclines, quinolones, and sulfonamides. Isolates from O and AF farms harbored a lower proportion of resistance to antibiotics than isolates from C farms. Among the determinants for ESBL/pAmpC, CTX-M-1 prevailed (42.7%), followed by TEM-type (29%) and SHV (19.8%). Avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), belonging to ST117 and ST349, were identified in the collection. These data confirm the possible role of a broiler as an ESBL/AmpC EC and APEC reservoir for humans. Overall, our study suggests that antibiotic-free and organic production may contribute to a reduced exposure to ESBL/AmpC EC for the consumer. © 2022 by the authors.},

While ethnicity measures both the individual genetic ancestry and cultural traits shared within a group, geographic location reflects the macroenvironment to which individuals are exposed during their daily life. Examination of ethnicity and geographic location will allow us to gain an insight into how genes and culture interacting with ecological factors affect the development of cancer in humans. This chapter provides an overview of the distribution of cancer incidence or mortality by ethnicity and geographic location in the United States, and specific risk factors for lung cancer, which is one of the most common causes of cancer death consistently across different ethnic groups. Because Asian countries such as China may have a different pattern of human cancer from the more developed world, the most common cancers and related risk factors in China are also discussed. Finally, a brief summary of cancer risk factors, including environmental exposures, infectious agents and psychosocial stressors, and their potential mechanisms and potential dietary interventions and chemopreventive agents are described. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
