	abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial illness worldwide. Current vaccines based on the polysaccharide capsule are only effective against a limited number of the .100 capsular serotypes. A universal vaccine based on conserved protein antigens requires a thorough understanding of gene expression in S. pneumoniae. All S. pneumoniae strains encode the SpnIII Restriction-Modification system. This system contains a phase-variable methyltransferase that switches specificity, and controls expression of multiple genes—a phasevarion. We examined the role of this phasevarion during pneumococcal pathobiology, and determined if phase variation resulted in differences in expression of currently investigated conserved protein antigens. Using locked strains that express a single methyltransferase specificity, we found differences in clinically relevant traits, including survival in blood, and adherence to and invasion of human cells. We also observed differences in expression of numerous proteinaceous vaccine candidates, which complicates selection of antigens for inclusion in a universal protein-based pneumococcal vaccine. This study will inform vaccine design against S. pneumoniae by ensuring only stably expressed candidates are included in a rationally designed vaccine. IMPORTANCE S. pneumoniae is the world’s foremost bacterial pathogen. S. pneumoniae encodes a phasevarion (phase-variable regulon), that results in differential expression of multiple genes. Previous work demonstrated that the pneumococcal SpnIII phasevarion switches between six different expression states, generating six unique phenotypic variants in a pneumococcal population. Here, we show that this phasevarion generates multiple phenotypic differences relevant to pathobiology. Importantly, expression of conserved protein antigens varies with phasevarion switching. As capsule expression, a major pneumococcal virulence factor, is also controlled by the phasevarion, our work will inform the selection of the best candidates to include in a rationally designed, universal pneumococcal vaccine.

	abstract = {Ecosystem structure and function are increasingly threatened by changing climate, with profound effects observed globally in recent decades. Based on standardized visual censuses of reef biodiversity, we describe 27 years of community-level change for fishes, mobile macroinvertebrates and macroalgae in the Tasmanian ocean-warming hotspot. Significant ecological change was observed across 94 reef sites (5-10 m depth range) spanning four coastal regions between three periods (1992-95, 2006-07, 2017-19), which occurred against a background of pronounced sea temperature rise (+0.80°C on average). Overall, fish biomass increased, macroinvertebrate species richness and abundance decreased and macroalgal cover decreased, particularly during the most recent decade. While reef communities were relatively stable and warming was slight between the 1990s and mid-2000s (+0.12°C mean temperature rise), increased abundances of warm affinity fishes and invertebrates accompanied warming during the most recent decade (+0.68°C rise). However, significant rises in the community temperature index (CTI) were only found for fishes, invertebrates and macroalgae in some regions. Coastal warming was associated with increased fish biomass of non-targeted species in fished zones but had little effect on reef communities within marine reserves. Higher abundances of larger fishes and lobsters inside reserves appeared to negate impacts of 'thermophilization'. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Climatic extremes, such as heat waves, are increasing in frequency, intensity and duration under anthropogenic climate change. These extreme events pose a great threat to many organisms, and especially ectotherms, which are susceptible to high temperatures. In nature, many ectotherms, such as insects, may seek cooler microclimates and ’ride out´ extreme temperatures, especially when these are transient and unpredictable. However, some ectotherms, such as web-building spiders, may be more prone to heat-related mortality than more motile organisms. Adult females in many spider families are sedentary and build webs in micro-habitats where they spend their entire lives. Under extreme heat, they may be limited in their ability to move vertically or horizontally to find cooler microhabitats. Males, on the other hand, are often nomadic, have broader spatial distributions, and thus might be better able to escape exposure to heat. However, life-history traits in spiders such as the relative body size of males and females and spatial ecology also vary across different taxonomic groups based on their phylogeny. This may make different species or families more or less susceptible to heat waves and exposure to very high temperatures. Selection to extreme temperatures may drive adaptive responses in female physiology, morphology or web site selection in species that build small or exposed webs. Male spiders may be better able to avoid heat-related stress than females by seeking refuge under objects such as bark or rocks with cooler microclimates. Here, we discuss these aspects in detail and propose research focusing on male and female spider behavior and reproduction across different taxa exposed to temperature extremes. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Increased industrial growth in the world serves a significant role in the water contamination with heavy metals. Heavy metals such as arsenic, copper, lead, chromium, mercury, nickel, and cadmium impart several health hazards to humans, plants, and animals. Moreover their accumulation potential disturbs the food chain. Freshwater demand is higher in the world which may lead to a severe water crisis in the upcoming years. Hence feasible water treatment technologies must be identified and its efficiency must be concentrated. Heavy metals bear the risk of biodegradation and transformation. Hence adsorption is found to be an attractive method nowadays for sequestration of such metals. It is an economically feasible and eco-friendly method. Biochar is advantageous over other adsorbents such as activated carbon, graphene, silica, etc. It is the product of a thermochemical process which possesses better adsorption capacity. It reduces the production time and in addition provides fuel. Different pyrolysis conditions influence the quantity and yield of char. The degree of biochar adsorption is mainly focused on the type of biomass used, metal species concentrated, functional groups, and surface area of the biochar. Regeneration of biomass is also an important phenomenon to be considered as the adsorbed biochar may cause secondary pollution if not disposed in a proper manner. In order to improve the surface properties, physical structure, and regeneration capacity of biochar, various modification technologies have been adopted. It will also pave way for the effective utilization of waste biomaterials in wastewater treatment. The modification may be carried out before pyrolysis or after pyrolysis. It is categorized under physical, chemical, magnetic, and mineral impregnation methods. This review focuses on the mechanism and improvements of the treated biochar in comparison to the pristine biochar for heavy metal sequestration. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021, corrected publication 2022.},

	abstract = {The vertebrate stress response comprises a suite of behavioural and physiological traits that must be functionally integrated to ensure organisms cope adaptively with acute stressors. Natural selection should favour functional integration, leading to a prediction of genetic integration of these traits. Despite the implications of such genetic integration for our understanding of human and animal health, as well as evolutionary responses to natural and anthropogenic stressors, formal quantitative genetic tests of this prediction are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that acute stress response components in Trinidadian guppies are both heritable and integrated on the major axis of genetic covariation. This integration could either facilitate or constrain evolutionary responses to selection, depending upon the alignment of selection with this axis. Such integration also suggests artificial selection on the genetically correlated behavioural responses to stress could offer a viable non-invasive route to the improvement of health and welfare in captive animal populations. @ Houslay et al.},

	abstract = {The storage root crop cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is predicted to remain central to future food and economic security for smallholder farming households and agricultural output in the tropics. Genetic improvement of cassava is required to meet changing farmer and consumer needs, evolving pests and diseases, and challenges presented by climate change. Transgenic and genome editing technologies offer significant potential for introducing desired traits into farmer-preferred varieties and breeding lines, and for studying the biology of this under-investigated crop species. A bottleneck in implementing genetic modification in this species has been access to robust methods for transformation of cassava cultivars and landraces. In this article, we provide a detailed protocol for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cassava and regeneration of genetically modified plants. Basic Protocol 1 describes how to establish and micropropagate in vitro cassava plantlets, and Alternate Protocol 1 details how to establish in vitro cultures from field or greenhouse cuttings. Basic Protocol 2 describes all steps necessary for genetic transformation in the model variety 60444, and Alternate Protocol 2 provides details for modifying this method for use with other cultivars. Finally, Basic Protocol 3 describes how to establish plants produced via Basic Protocol 2 and Alternate Protocol 2 in soil in a greenhouse. These methods have proven applications across more than a dozen genotypes and are capable of producing transgenic and gene-edited plants for experimental purposes, for testing under greenhouse and field conditions, and for development of plants suitable for subsequent regulatory approval and product deployment. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {AU Movement: Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly is critical to animal survival and, thus, biodiversity: in fragmented landscapes. Increasing fragmentation in the Anthropocene necessitates predictions about the movement capacities of the multitude of species that inhabit natural ecosystems. This requires mechanistic, trait-based animal locomotion models, which are sufficiently general as well as biologically realistic. While larger animals should generally be able to travel greater distances, reported trends in their maximum speeds across a range of body sizes suggest limited movement capacities among the largest species. Here, we show that this also applies to travel speeds and that this arises because of their limited heat-dissipation capacities. We derive a model considering how fundamental biophysical constraints of animal body mass associated with energy utilisation (i.e., larger animals have a lower metabolic energy cost of locomotion) and heat-dissipation (i.e., larger animals require more time to dissipate metabolic heat) limit aerobic travel speeds. Using an extensive empirical dataset of animal travel speeds (532 species), we show that this allometric heat-dissipation model best captures the hump-shaped trends in travel speed with body mass for flying, running, and swimming animals. This implies that the inability to dissipate metabolic heat leads to the saturation and eventual decrease in travel speed with increasing body mass as larger animals must reduce their realised travel speeds in order to avoid hyperthermia during extended locomotion bouts. As a result, the highest travel speeds are achieved by animals of intermediate body mass, suggesting that the largest species are more limited in their movement capacities than previously anticipated. Consequently, we provide a mechanistic understanding of animal travel speed that can be generalised across species, even when the details of an individual species' biology are unknown, to facilitate more realistic predictions of biodiversity dynamics in fragmented landscapes.

	abstract = {Background: The vineyard is a great reservoir of autochthonous yeast strains whose composition is defined by different regional (edaphology, orography or climatology) and anthropological factors (cultivation systems or cultural practices). Most of this yeast diversity corresponds to non-Saccharomyces strains, some of which have potential use in winemaking. Methods: The oenological potential of 29 different native non-Saccharomyces strains belonging to 4 species (Lachancea thermotolerans, Torulaspora delbrueckii, Starmerella bacillaris and Metschnikowia spp.) was evaluated, using the autochthonous Saccharomyces cerevisiae XG3 strain as a control. Micro-fermentations with pure culture of each strain were performed in duplicate and the basic parameters and major volatiles of wines were analysed following official methodology. The best strain within each species was selected using a quantification matrix including the relevant oenological characteristics. Results: The fermentative ability of non-Saccharomyces was lower than S. cerevisiae in all cases, but with differences among species. L. thermotolerans and T. delbrueckii showed higher fermentation rates than Starm. bacillaris, whereas Metschnikowia spp. presented a low fermentative power. At chemical level all non-Saccharomyces strains reduced the alcoholic content, the higher alcohols and the volatile acidity of wines and increased the content of glycerol, with differences among strains within a given species. T. delbrueckii and L. thermotolerans increased the total acidity of wines. The latter and Metschnikowia spp. strains produced lactic acid, which decreased the wine pH in the case of L. thermotolerans. According to their oenological traits the best rated strains of each species were Lt93, Td315, Mf278 and Sb474. In addition, the data obtained in pure fermentations were correlated to those chemical and aromatic compounds obtained with these non-Saccharomyces strains in sequential fermentations. Conclusions: Autochthonous strains of non-Saccharomyces yeast species contribute distinctive chemical characteristics to the wines. The correlations observed between wines fermented with the different non-Saccharomyces indigenous strains in pure and sequential fermentations suggest that their contribution to wine properties remains stable regardless of must composition or winemaking techniques. © 2023 The Author(s).

Considering that a non-harmful species in its native region can exhibit invasive behaviour when established in new environments, bio-ethological observations were conducted to better understand whether V. crabro could show invasive traits in Sardinia, which represents a new introduction area. Data on the foraging activity of the European hornet in open fields were collected within a citizen science monitoring program carried out in Sardinia from 2018 to 2020. Moreover, specific behavioural observations were made in apiaries to assess the predatory activity of the hornet towards honey bees and at the entrance of free-living European hornet colonies to evaluate other aspects of its behaviour, i.e., intranidal and extranidal tasks. The results of our study are discussed in relation to the behavioural traits known for this species in its native areas to place the behavioural repertoire of V. crabro in Sardinia into a wider context. Our observations revealed that V. crabro did not show any changes in behavioural traits in Sardinia compared to those described in its area of origin, so the risk of becoming an invasive species on this island seems unlikely. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Global change has dramatic impacts on grassland diversity. However, little is known about how fast species can adapt to diversity loss and how this affects their responses to global change. Here, we performed a common garden experiment testing whether plant responses to global change are influenced by their selection history and the conditioning history of soil at different plant diversity levels. Using seeds of four grass species and soil samples from a 14-year old biodiversity experiment, we grew the offspring of the plants either in their own soil or in soil of a different community, and exposed them either to drought, increased nitrogen input, or a combination of both. Under nitrogen addition, offspring of plants selected at high diversity produced more biomass than those selected at low diversity, while drought neutralized differences in biomass production. Moreover, under the influence of global change drivers, soil history, and to a lesser extent plant history, had species-specific effects on trait expression. Our results show that plant diversity modulates plant-soil interactions and growth strategies of plants, which in turn affects plant eco-evolutionary pathways. How this change affects species' response to global change and whether this can cause a feedback loop should be investigated in more detail in future studies. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Drought stress influences the vigor of plant seeds and inhibits seed germination, making it one of the primary environmental factors adversely affecting food security. The seed germination stage is critical to ensuring the growth and productivity of soybeans in soils prone to drought conditions. We here examined the genetic diversity and drought-tolerance phenotypes of 410 accessions of a germplasm diversity panel for soybean and conducted quantitative genetics analyses to identify loci associated with drought tolerance of seed germination. We uncovered significant differences among the diverse genotypes for four growth indices and five drought-tolerance indices, which revealed abundant variation among genotypes, upon drought stress, and for genotype × treatment effects. We also used 158,327 SNP markers and performed GWAS for the drought-related traits. Our data met the conditions (PCA + K) for using a mixed linear model in TASSEL, and we thus identified 26 SNPs associated with drought tolerance indices for germination stage distributed across 10 chromosomes. Nine SNP sites, including, for example, Gm20_34956219 and Gm20_36902659, were associated with two or more phenotypic indices, and there were nine SNP markers located in or adjacent to (within 500 kb) previously reported drought tolerance QTLs. These SNPs led to our identification of 41 candidate genes related to drought tolerance in the germination stage. The results of our study contribute to a deeper understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying drought tolerance in soybeans at the germination stage, thereby providing a molecular basis for identifying useful soybean germplasm for breeding new drought-tolerant varieties. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Fluctuations in environmental temperature affect energy metabolism and stimulate the expression of reversible phenotypic plasticity in vertebrate behavioural and physiological traits. Changes in circulating concentrations of glucocorticoid hormones often underpin environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity. Ongoing climate change is predicted to increase fluctuations in environmental temperature globally, making it imperative to determine the standing phenotypic variation in glucocorticoid responses of free-living populations to evaluate their potential for coping via plastic or evolutionary changes. Using a reaction norm approach, we repeatedly sampled wild great tit (Parus major) individuals for circulating glucocorticoid concentrations during reproduction across five years to quantify individual variation in glucocorticoid plasticity along an environmental temperature gradient. As expected, baseline and stress-induced glucocorticoid concentrations increased with lower environmental temperatures at the population and within-individual level. Moreover, we provide unique evidence that individuals differ significantly in their plastic responses to the temperature gradient for both glucocorticoid traits, with some displaying greater plasticity than others. Average concentrations and degree of plasticity covaried for baseline glucocorticoids, indicating that these two reaction norm components are linked. Hence, individual variation in glucocorticoid plasticity in response to a key environmental factor exists in a wild vertebrate population, representing a crucial step to assess their potential to endure temperature fluctuations. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The toxic dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi is a harmful algal bloom-forming species in coastal areas around the world. It produces ichthyotoxins and hemolytic toxins, with deleterious effects on marine ecosystems. In this study, the bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. FDHY-MZ2, with high algicidal efficiency against K. mikimotoi, was isolated from a bloom event. Based on the results, it completely lysed K. mikimotoi cells within 24 h 0.5% (vol/vol), with the algicidal activity of the supernatant of the bacterium culture. Algal cell wall fragmentation occurred, leading to cell death. There was a marked decline in various photochemical traits. When treated with the supernatant, cellulase, pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO) and cyclin B genes were significantly increased, suggesting induced cell wall deterioration, chloroplast degradation and cell cycle regulation of K. mikimotoi cells. In addition, the expression levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging gene was significantly inhibited, indicating that the ROS removal system was damaged. The bacterial culture was dried to obtain the spray-dried powder, which showed algicidal activity rates of 92.2 and 100% against a laboratory K. mikimotoi culture and a field microcosm of Karlodinium sp. bloom within 24 h with the addition of 0.04% mass fraction powder. Our results demonstrate that FDHY-MZ2 is a suitable strain for K. mikimotoi and Karlodinium sp. blooms management. In addition, this study provides a new strategy for the anthropogenic control of harmful algal bloom-forming species in situ. IMPORTANCE K. mikimotoi is a noxious algal bloom-forming species that cause damaging of the aquaculture industry and great financial losses. Bacterium with algicidal activity is an ideal agency to inhibit the growth of harmful algae. In this approach application, the bacterium with high algicidal activity is required and the final management material is ideal for easy-to-use. The algicidal characteristics are also needed to understand the effects of the bacterium for managing strategy exploration. In this study, we isolated a novel algicidal bacterium with extremely high lysis efficiency for K. mikimotoi. The algicidal characteristics of the bacterium as well as the chemical and molecular response of K. mikimotoi with the strain challenge were examined. Finally, the algicidal powder was explored for application. The results demonstrate that FDHY-MZ2 is suitable for K. mikimotoi and Karlodinium sp. blooms controlling, and this study provides a new strategy for algicidal bacterium application.

	abstract = {Drought is a critical and increasingly common abiotic factor that has impacts on plant structures and functioning and is a challenge for the successful management of forest ecosystems. Here, we test the shifts in leaf morpho-anatomical or hydraulic traits and plant growth above ground caused by drought. A factorial experiment was conducted with two gymnosperms (Larix gmelinii and Pinus koraiensis) and two angiosperms (Fraxinus mandshurica and Tilia amurensis), tree species grown under three varying drought intensities in NE China. Considering all the species studied, the plant height (PH), root collar diameter (RCD), and plant biomass (PB) were significantly decreased by drought. The leaf thickness (LT) increased, while the leaf area (LA) decreased with drought intensity. In the gymnosperms, the mesophyll thickness (MT) increased, and the resin duct decreased, while in the angiosperms the palisade mesophyll thickness (PMT), the spongy mesophyll thickness (SMT), and the abaxial (ABE) and adaxial epidermis (ADE) thickness were increased by drought. The correlation analysis revealed that P. koraiensis and F. mandshurica had the higher RMF and total plant biomass, but the least LMF, suggesting drought tolerance. In contrast, the L. gmelinii had the least RMF and higher LMF, suggesting vulnerability to drought. Similarly, T. amurensis had the higher leaf size, which increased the evaporative demand and depleted the soil water quickly relative to the other species. The interrelation among the morpho-anatomical leaf traits was equally affected by drought across all the studied species, suggesting that there is no clear evidence to differentiate the taxa based on drought resistance vs. drought tolerance. Thus, we have identified some easily measurable traits (i.e., LMF, RMF, and PB) which evidenced the seedling’s ability to cope with drought and which therefore could be used as proxies in the selection of drought tolerant species for reforestation in the temperate forest. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Rapid evolutionary change during range expansions can lead to diverging range core and front populations, with the emergence of dispersal syndromes (coupled responses in dispersal and life-history traits). Besides intraspecific effects, range expansions may be impacted by interspecific interactions such as parasitism. Yet, despite the potentially large impact of parasites imposing additional selective pressures on the host, their role on range expansions remains largely unexplored. Using microcosm populations of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata, we studied experimental range expansions under parasite presence or absence. We found that the interaction of range expansion and parasite treatments affected the evolution of host dispersal syndromes. Namely, front populations showed different associations of population growth parameters and swimming behaviours than core populations, indicating divergent evolution. Parasitism reshaped trait associations, with hosts evolved in the presence of the parasite exhibiting overall increased resistance and reduced dispersal. Nonetheless, when comparing infected range core and front populations, we found a positive association, suggesting joint evolution of resistance and dispersal at the front. We conclude that host–parasite interactions during range expansions can change evolutionary trajectories; this in turn may feedback on the ecological dynamics of the range expansion and parasite epidemics. © 2023 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Agricultural productivity is constantly influenced by several factors such as urbanization, less availability of cultivable land, lack of sufficient automation, and abiotic and biotic stresses. Global climatic conditions significantly influenced the annual precipitation. Thus, decreased rainfalls, increased dry spells, soil salinity, and high temperature considerably affect agriculture productivity. On the other hand, the ever-burgeoning human population demands more food from the limited resources, putting much pressure on agricultural productivity. Drought stress causes several morphological, structural, biochemical, and molecular changes in plants. Plants to endure drought stress synthesize several secondary metabolites, reactive oxygen species, and module hormone production and induce several drought resistance genes. However, not all plants respond to the drought stress in the same magnitude. Most of the cultivable crops are drought-sensitive. Thus, the scientific community adopted several methods to improve drought tolerance in crop plants. Due to the constraints of agronomical practices, genetic engineering (GE), and marker-assisted breeding approaches, scientists recently developed a spark of interest in improving the crop plant’s performance under extreme environmental conditions with the natural plant-associated microbiome. The plant-associated microbiome may improve drought stress tolerance through multiple pathways, such as improving the mineral nutrition absorption, phytohormone production, ACC deaminase activity, and root system, producing exopolysaccharides, and triggering the systemic induced resistance. The chapter discussed the detailed mechanism of the endophytic microbiome colonization process, functional traits of the microbiome, and drought tolerance mechanism of the endophytic microbiome with some examples. © The Editor(s) (ifapplicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.},

	abstract = {Structural and physiological changes in the female reproductive system underlie the origins of pregnancy in multiple vertebrate lineages. In mammals, the glandular portion of the lower reproductive tract has transformed into a structure specialized for supporting fetal development. These specializations range from relatively simple maternal nutrient provisioning in egg-laying monotremes to an elaborate suite of traits that support intimate maternal-fetal interactions in Euthe-rians. Among these traits are the maternal decidua and fetal component of the placenta, but there is considerable uncertainty about how these structures evolved. Previously, we showed that changes in uterine gene expression contributes to several evolutionary innovations during the origins of pregnancy (Mika et al., 2021b). Here, we reconstruct the evolution of entire transcriptomes (‘ances-tral transcriptome reconstruction’) and show that maternal gene expression profiles are correlated with degree of placental invasion. These results indicate that an epitheliochorial-like placenta evolved early in the mammalian stem-lineage and that the ancestor of Eutherians had a hemochorial placenta, and suggest maternal control of placental invasiveness. These data resolve major transitions in the evolution of pregnancy and indicate that ancestral transcriptome reconstruction can be used to study the function of ancestral cell, tissue, and organ systems. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Candida albicans is the principal causative agent of lethal fungal infections, predominantly in immunocompromised hosts. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been described as crucial in the interaction of microorganisms with their host. Since the yeast-to-hypha transition is an important virulence trait with great impact in invasive candidiasis (IC), we have addressed the characterization of EVs secreted by hyphal cells (HEVs) from C. albicans, comparing them to yeast EVs (YEVs). YEVs comprised a larger population of bigger EVs with mainly cell wall proteins, while HEVs were smaller, in general, and had a much higher protein diversity. YEVs were able to rescue the sensitivity of a cell wall mutant against calcofluor white, presumably due to the larger amount of cell wall proteins they contained. On the other hand, HEVs also contained many cytoplasmic proteins related to protein metabolism and intracellular protein transport and the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway related to exosome biogenesis, pointing to an intracellular origin of HEVs. Interestingly, an active 20S proteasome complex was secreted exclusively in HEVs. Moreover, HEVs contained a greater number of virulence-related proteins. As for their immunogenic role, both types of EV presented immune reactivity with human sera from patients suffering invasive candidiasis; however, under our conditions, only HEVs showed a cytotoxic effect on human macrophages and could elicit the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) by these macrophages. IMPORTANCE This first analysis of HEVs of C. albicans has shown clear differences between them and the YEVs of C. albicans, showing their relevance and possible use in the discovery of new diagnostic markers and treatment targets against C. albicans infections. The data obtained point to different mechanisms of biogenesis of YEVs and HEVs, as well as different involvements in cell biology and host interaction. YEVs played a more relevant role in cell wall maintenance, while HEVs were more closely related to virulence, as they had greater effects on human immune cells. Importantly, an active 20S proteosome complex was described as a fungal-EV cargo. A deeper study of its role and those of many other proteins exclusively detected in HEVs and involved in different relevant biological processes of this fungus could open up interesting new areas of research in the battle against C. albicans.

Dactylogyrus species are usually found on the gills of this rare minnow in laboratory farming systems. Dactylogyrid infection may change the sensibility of fish to toxicants and affect toxicological evaluations. In the present study, dactylogyrid infection was investigated, and species of Dactylogyrus collected from rare minnows were determined. Based on the observed ‘D. wunderi’ type anchors, with a shorter outer root and elongated inner root, and accessory piece consisting of two parts, the dactylogyrids were identified as D. gobiocypris. A partial 18S-ITS1 rDNA sequence was firstly sequenced, and the highest sequence identity (86.7%) was to D. cryptomeres. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that D. gobiocypris formed a clade with D. squameus, D. finitimus, and D. cryptomeres, all of which have been recorded in the family Gobionidae. Histopathology analysis indicated that a heavy burden of D. gobiocypris caused necrosis of gill filaments. Inflammatory responses, such as tumefaction and hyperaemia, were also observed on gills with severe dactylogyrid infection. Supplementary morphological characteristics and 18S-ITS1 rDNA sequence provided basic data for identification of this parasite species. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Plants differ in their ability to cope with external stresses (e.g., drought tolerance). Genome duplications are an important mechanism to enable plant adaptation. This leads to characteristic footprints in the genome, such as protein family expansion. We explore genetic diversity and uncover evolutionary adaptation to stresses by exploiting genome comparisons between stress tolerant and sensitive species and RNA-Seq data sets from stress experiments. Expanded gene families that are stress-responsive based on differential expression analysis could hint at species or clade-specific adaptation, making these gene families exciting candidates for follow-up tolerance studies and crop improvement. Software: Integration of such cross-species omics data is a challenging task, requiring various steps of transformation and filtering. Ultimately, visualization is crucial for quality control and interpretation. To address this, we developed A2TEA: Automated Assessment of Trait-specific Evolutionary Adaptations, a Snakemake workflow for detecting adaptation footprints in silico. It functions as a one-stop processing pipeline, integrating protein family, phylogeny, expression, and protein function analysis. The pipeline is accompanied by an R Shiny web application that allows exploring, highlighting, and exporting the results interactively. This allows the user to formulate hypotheses regarding the genomic adaptations of one or a subset of the investigated species to a given stress. Conclusions: While our research focus is on crops, the pipeline is entirely independent of the underlying species and can be used with any set of species. We demonstrate pipeline efficiency on real-world datasets and discuss the implementation and limits of our analysis workflow as well as planned extensions to its current state.

	abstract = {Global warming is predicted to have a generally negative effect on food grain production. The emergence of seedlings, blooming, pod-filling stages and yield of the mung bean are affected by high-temperature stress. Melatonin is a multifunctional signaling molecule with antioxidant properties that plays a vital role in plant stress defense mechanism. With this knowledge, the experiment was conducted to identify the optimum melatonin concentration to mitigate the adverse effects of high temperature in green gram var CO 8 with a completely randomized design (CRD). The treatments consisted of soaking seeds with different melatonin concentrations, viz., 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μM. Seeds were sown in a pertidish and allowed to germinate. After 5 days, the seedlings were exposed to two different high-temperature stress following the temperature induction response (TIR) protocol in the growth chamber viz., Ambient + 2°C (40°C) and Ambient + 4°C (42°C). After stress period, the seedlings were allowed to recover at room temperature for 2 days. At the end of the recovery period, observations on temperature tolerancerelated traits viz., survival percentage, per cent reduction of shoot and root growth, cell viability, mortality per cent, malondialdehyde content, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity of green gram seedlings were assessed. Seeds pre-treated with melatonin of 100 and 80 µM exhibited higher survival percentage, shoot and root growth, cell viability and antioxidant enzyme activity (like superoxide dismutase and catalase) with reduced mortality per cent and malondialdehyde content under hightemperature stress at both 40°C and 42°C. The results revealed that seeds treated with different melatonin concentrations significantly improved green gram germination and seedling health. © 2023, Applied and Natural Science Foundation.

	abstract = {ity. Little is known about plant-associated microbiomes and their functional roles in assisting plant growth under drought. We investigated the genetic and transcriptomic characteristics of opportunistic beneficial microorganisms that selectively alleviate stress through plant-bacteria interactions under drought. Pseudomonas fluorescens DR397 was isolated from the drought-prone rhizospheric soil of soybean and showed high metabolic activity at 21.25 Mpa. The genome of DR397 possesses several genes related to the synthesis of compatible solutes (choline and glycine-betaine), exopolysaccharides (alginate and cellulose), and secretion systems (type II, III, IV, and VI), as well as genes related to plant growth promotion (indole-3-acetic acid, transketolase, and thiamine phosphate synthesis). The expression of these genes was significantly upregulated (8- to 263-fold change) only under drought conditions with plant root exudate treatment, whereas subtle transcriptomic changes were observed under solely root exudate treatment. When DR397 was placed on both legume cultivars (Pisum sativum and Phaseolus vulgaris), growth was hardly affected under well-watered conditions, but the shoot and root growths were increased by up from 62.0% to 149.1% compared with the control group under drought conditions.

We identify the interaction of temporal and spatial variation in selection and their role in either reinforcing or eroding divergence between two closely related Mimulus species. Using repeated reciprocal transplant experiments with advanced generation hybrids, we compare the strength of selection on quantitative traits involved in adaptation and reproductive isolation in Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus laciniatus between two years with dramatically different water availability. We found strong divergent habitat-mediated selection on traits in the direction of species differences during a drought in 2013, suggesting that spatially varying selection maintains species divergence. However, a relaxation in divergent selection on most traits in an unusually wet year (2019), including flowering time, which is involved in pre-zygotic isolation, suggests that temporal variation in selection may weaken species differences. Therefore, we find evidence that temporally and spatially varying selection may have opposing roles in mediating species boundaries. Given our changing climate, future growing seasons are expected to be more similar to the dry year, suggesting that in this system climate change may actually increase species divergence.  © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Drought is a major abiotic factor and affects cereal-based staple food production and reliability in developing countries such as Pakistan. To ensure a sustainable and consistent food supply, holistic production plans involving the integration of several drought mitigation approaches are required. Using a randomized complete block design strategy, we examined the drought-ameliorating characteristics of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and nanoparticles (NPs) exclusively or as a combined application (T4) through three stages (D1, D2, and D3) of wheat growth (T1, control). Our field research revealed that Azospirillum brasilense alone (T2) and zinc oxide NPs (T3) improved wheat plant water relations, chlorophyll, proline, phenolics and grain quality, yield, and their allied traits over the stressed treatments. Specifically, the best outcome was observed in the combined treatment of PGPR and ZnO NPs (T4). Interestingly, the combined treatment delivered effective drought mitigation through enhanced levels of antioxidants (15% APX, 27% POD, 35% CAT, 38% PPO and 44% SOD) over controls at the grain-filling stage (GFS, D3 × T1). The 40% improvements were recorded under the combined treatment at GFS over their respective controls. Their combined usage (PGPR and ZnO NPs) was concluded as an effective strategy for building wheat resilience under drought, especially in arid and semi-arid localities. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Disturbances, both natural and anthropogenic, influence the patterning of species and species traits. The shift in species composition and distribution pattern of functional traits can demonstrate if the community is resistant, sensitive or resilient to the disturbance. Based on species- and trait-based approaches, we examined the response of the earthworm community to changing hydrologic conditions caused by the artificial drainage of mountain fens, in which cumulative effects of disturbance events over space and time are much less dynamic than in riverine wetlands. We hypothesized that the drainage-related changes of mountain fen peat soils have an effect on the earthworm community composition and its functional structure. We assume that the shift in species composition and value of community-weighted functional traits reflect changes in the resilience or resistance of the earthworm community to environmental change. Our results demonstrate that the total density of earthworms was almost three times lower under drained conditions compared to natural ones. Artificial drainage of fens had a neutral effect on the species-based diversity indices. However, there were species-specific traits that responded to hydrologic changes and which led to the species’ replacements and to the co-occurrence of eurytopic, surface-browsing and more drought- and low-pH-resistant earthworm species in the drained fens. Based on these results, we conclude that abiotic-based environmental filtering was the main process responsible for sorting earthworms according to species and traits in the disturbed hydrologic conditions. The greater earthworm functional trait variations in semi-natural hydrologic conditions emphasizes the impact of transient dynamics in an altered disturbance regime on the earthworm assembly. Results also showed that in the changing hydrologic conditions of mountain fens, the functional trait approach revealed only slightly more predictive power than the taxonomic one, but it proved better with processes responsible for earthworm species filtering. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Unusually low temperatures caused by global climate change adversely affect rice production. Sensing cold to trigger signal network is a key base for improvement of chilling tolerance trait. Here, we report that Oryza sativa Calreticulin 3 (OsCRT3) localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exhibits conformational changes under cold stress, thereby enhancing its interaction with CBL-interacting protein kinase 7 (OsCIPK7) to sense cold. Phenotypic analyses of OsCRT3 knock-out mutants and transgenic overexpression lines demonstrate that OsCRT3 is a positive regulator in chilling tolerance. OsCRT3 localizes at the ER and mediates increases in cytosolic calcium levels under cold stress. Notably, cold stress triggers secondary structural changes of OsCRT3 and enhances its binding affinity with OsCIPK7, which finally boosts its kinase activity. Moreover, Calcineurin B-like protein 7 (OsCBL7) and OsCBL8 interact with OsCIPK7 specifically on the plasma membrane. Taken together, our results thus identify a cold-sensing mechanism that simultaneously conveys cold-induced protein conformational change, enhances kinase activity, and Ca2+ signal generation to facilitate chilling tolerance in rice. ©2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Most knowledge about Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathoadaptation is derived from studies on airway colonization in cystic fibrosis; little is known about adaptation in acute settings. P. aeruginosa frequently affects burned patients and the burn wound niche has distinct properties that likely influence pathoadaptation. This study aimed to genetically and phenotypically characterize P. aeruginosa isolates collected during an outbreak of infection in a burn intensive care unit (ICU). Sequencing reads from 58 isolates of ST1076 P. aeruginosa taken from 23 patients were independently mapped to a complete reference genome for the lineage (H25338); genetic differences were identified and were used to define the population structure. Comparative genomic analysis at single-nucleotide resolution identified pathoadaptive genes that evolved multiple, independent mutations. Three key phenotypic assays (growth performance, motility, carbapenem resistance) were performed to complement the genetic analysis for 47 unique isolates. Population structure for the ST1076 lineage revealed 11 evolutionary sublineages. Fifteen pathoadaptive genes evolved mutations in at least two sublineages. The most prominent functional classes affected were transcription/two-component regulatory systems, and chemotaxis/motility and attachment. The most frequently mutated gene was oprD, which codes for outer membrane porin involved in uptake of carbapenems. Reduced growth performance and motility were found to be adaptive phenotypic traits, as was high level of carbapenem resistance, which correlated with higher carbapenem consumption during the outbreak. Multiple prominent linages evolved each of the three traits in parallel providing evidence that they afford a fitness advantage for P. aeruginosa in the context of human burn infection. © 2022 Cameron et al.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean Sea (MED) is prone to species’ introductions, induced by human activities and/or climate change. Recent studies focus on the biological traits that result in such introductions, yet on a single-area-type approach. Here, we used, analyzed, and compared biological traits derived from FishBase for MED, non-indigenous (NIS) and neonative (NEO) in the Mediterranean, and adjacent Atlantic (ATL) and Red Sea (RS) species. A quantitative trait-based analysis was performed using random forest to determine the importance of traits in the successful establishment in the Mediterranean. MED fishes were mainly demersal, slow growing and small-medium sized, preferring intermediate temperatures. Conversely, ATL were mainly deep-dwelling species, preferring low temperatures. RS and NIS were predominantly reef-associated, thermophilus, and stenothermic. NEO species were stenothermic with preference to intermediate-high temperatures. Omnivores with preference to animals was the most common trophic group among regions. MED species exhibited higher phylogenetic uniqueness (PD50) compared to RS and NIS, indicating that they have long ancestral branches and few descendants. Preferred temperature, habitat type preference and maximum reported length (Lmax) and infinite length (Linf) were the most important predictors in the establishment process. Overall, the results presented here could serve as a baseline for future research, especially by using more refined and/or additional biological trail estimates. © 2022 by the authors.},

An indicator of community response diversity is the diversity of different traits associated with their capacity to be resistant to stress, to recover and to regulate ecosystem functions. We conducted a network analysis of traits using benthic macroinvertebrate community data from a large-scale field experiment to explore the loss of response diversity along environmental gradients. We elevated sediment nutrient concentrations (a process that occurs with eutrophication) at 24 sites (in 15 estuaries) with varying environmental conditions (water column turbidity and sediment properties). Macroinvertebrate community response capacity to nutrient stress was dependent on the baseline trait network complexity in the ambient community (i.e. non-enriched sediments). The greater the complexity of the baseline network, the less variable the network response to nutrient stress was; in contrast, more variable responses to nutrient stress occurred with simpler networks. Thus, stressors or environmental variables that shift baseline network complexity also shift the capacity for these ecosystems to respond to additional stressors. Empirical studies that explore the mechanisms responsible for loss of resilience are essential to inform our ability to predict changes in ecological states.  © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Climate warming is altering life cycles of ectotherms by advancing phenology and decreasing generation times. Theoretical models provide powerful tools to investigate these effects of climate warming on consumer-resource population dynamics. Yet, existing theory primarily considers organisms with simplified life histories in constant temperature environments, making it difficult to predict how warming will affect organisms with complex life cycles in seasonal environments. We develop a size-structured consumer-resource model with seasonal temperature dependence, parameterized for a freshwater insect consuming zooplankton. We simulate how climate warming in a seasonal environment could alter a key life-history trait of the consumer, number of generations per year, mediating responses of consumer-resource population sizes and consumer persistence. We find that, with warming, consumer population sizes increase through multiple mechanisms. First, warming decreases generation times by increasing rates of resource ingestion and growth and/or lengthening the growing season. Second, these life-history changes shorten the juvenile stage, increasing the number of emerging adults and population-level reproduction. Unstructured models with similar assumptions found that warming destabilized consumer-resource dynamics. By contrast, our size-structured model predicts stability and consumer persistence. Our study suggests that, in seasonal environments experiencing climate warming, life-history changes that lead to shorter generation times could delay population extinctions.  © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Plants are generally associated with diverse microorganisms in its whole parts. Endophytic organisms are those microorganisms that colonize the plant internal tissue showing no external sign of infection or negative effect on their host. Endophytic bacteria have been isolated from a large diversity of plant species. Beneficial effects of endophytes to plants include helping plants acquire nutrients, via atmospheric nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, iron chelation or siderophore production, increased drought resistance, thermal protection, and survival under osmotic stress. A particular bacterium may affect plant growth and development using one or more of these mechanisms and may use different ones at various times during the life cycle of the plant. In addition to these plant growth-promoting traits, endophytic bacteria must also be compatible with host plants and able to colonize the tissues of the host plants without being recognized as pathogens. The endophytic bacteria have a multitude of applications that enhance agricultural production. They enhance wheat growth through production of phytohormones, increase rice production by increasing mineral availability, increase cotton disease resistance, contribute to corn pest management, fix nitrogen in rice and wheat, decrease susceptibility to frost damage, and increase potato tuber formation under heat stress conditions. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

	abstract = {Ice shelves cover ~1.6 million km2 of the Antarctic continental shelf and are sensitive indicators of climate change. With ice-shelf retreat, aphotic marine environments transform into new open-water spaces of photo-induced primary production and associated organic matter export to the benthos.

Four sites, ~1 to 16 km from the ice-shelf front, were explored for megabenthic assemblages, and potential environmental drivers of assemblage structures were assessed. Faunal density increased with distance from the ice shelf, with epifaunal deposit-feeders a surrogate for overall density trends. Faunal richness did not exhibit a significant pattern with distance from the ice shelf and was most variable at sites closest to the ice-shelf front. Faunal assemblages significantly differed in composition among sites, and those nearest to the ice shelf were the most dissimilar; however, ice-shelf proximity did not emerge as a significant driver of assemblage structure. Overall, the study found a biologically-diverse and complex seafloor environment close to an ice-shelf front and provides ecological baselines for monitoring benthic ecosystem responses to environmental change, supporting marine management. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In many regions fire regimes are changing due to anthropogenic factors. Understanding the responses of species to fire can help to develop predictive models and inform fire management decisions. Spiders are a diverse and ubiquitous group and can offer important insights into the impacts of fire on invertebrates and whether these depend on environmental factors, phylogenetic history or functional traits. We conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses of data from studies investigating the impacts of fire on spiders. We investigated whether fire affects spider abundance or presence and whether ecologically relevant traits or site-specific factors influence species' responses to fire. Although difficult to make broad generalizations about the impacts of fire due to variation in site- and fire-specific factors, we find evidence that short fire intervals may be a threat to some spiders, and that fire affects abundance and species compositions in forests relative to other vegetation types. Orb and sheet web weavers were also more likely to be absent after fire than ambush hunters, ground hunters and other hunters suggesting functional traits may affect responses. Finally, we show that analyses of published data can be used to detect broad-scale patterns and provide an alternative to traditional meta-analytical approaches.  © 2023 The Authors.},

Climate change is altering abiotic seasonality (e.g., longer summers) and in turn, phenological patterns contained within. However, how phenology should evolve is still an unsolved problem. This problem lies at the crux of predicting future phenological changes that will likely have substantial ecosystem consequences, and more fundamentally, of understanding an undeniably global phenomenon. Most studies have associated proximate environmental variables with phenological responses in case-specific ways, making it difficult to contextualize observations within a general evolutionary framework. We outline the complex but universal ways in which seasonal timing maps onto evolutionary fitness. We borrow lessons from life history theory and evolutionary demography that have benefited from a first principles-based theoretical scaffold. Lastly, we identify key questions for theorists and empiricists to help advance our general understanding of phenology. © 2022 Park, Post.

These changes may impact ecosystem functioning through their influence on functional diversity. We investigate patterns of functional diversity, functional niches, and functional traits in bivalve communities across the energetic gradient of the deep Atlantic Ocean. We use the functional traits feeding type, tiering, and motility level to define the axes of functional space and the unique combinations of these traits as functional niches. We find that increased energy affords new species, added into functional space through niche expansion rather than niche packing. Underlying this pattern are complex dynamics of gains and losses of individual functional niches, with few adapted to the low- and high-energy extremes, and most occurring at intermediate energy. Adaptive qualities of specific traits are evidenced by those functional niches occurring at energetic extremes. Tradeoffs between these traits within the intermediate energy zone underlie an increased coexistence of functional niches, which in turn drives a unimodal pattern of functional niches and expansion of used functional space. This work suggests that energy-limited communities may be especially vulnerable to continued shifts in food availability through the Anthropocene.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

The consequences of evolving in variable, fluctuating environments are explored by a large body of theory: when populations evolve in fluctuating environments the frequency of fluctuations determines the shapes of tolerance curves (indicative of habitats that organisms can inhabit) and trait reaction norms (the phenotypes that organisms display across these environments). Despite this well-established theoretical backbone, predicting how trait and tolerance curves will evolve in organisms at the foundation of marine ecosystems remains a challenge. Here, we used a globally distributed phytoplankton, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and show that fluctuations in temperature on scales of 3-4 generations rapidly selected for populations with enhanced trait plasticity and elevated thermal tolerance. Fluctuations spanning 30-40 generations selected for the formation of two stable, genetically and physiologically distinct populations, one evolving high trait plasticity and enhanced thermal tolerance, and the other, akin to samples evolved under constant warming, with lower trait plasticity and a smaller increase in thermal tolerance.  © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Reproduction is a central activity for all living organisms but is also associated with a diversity of costs that are detrimental for survival. Until recently, the cost of cancer as a selective force has been poorly considered. Considering 191 mammal species, we found cancer mortality was more likely to be detected in species having large, rather than low, litter sizes and long lactation lengths regardless of the placentation types. However, increasing litter size and gestation length are not per se associated with an enhanced cancer mortality risk. Contrary to basic theoretical expectations, the species with the highest cancer mortality were not those with the most invasive (i.e. haemochorial) placentation, but those with a moderately invasive (i.e. endotheliochorial) one. Overall, these results suggest that (i) high reproductive efforts favour oncogenic processes' dynamics, presumably because of trade-offs between allocation in reproduction effort and anti-cancer defences, (ii) cancer defence mechanisms in animals are most often adjusted to align reproductive lifespan, and (iii) malignant cells co-opt existing molecular and physiological pathways for placentation, but species with the most invasive placentation have also selected for potent barriers against lethal cancers. This work suggests that the logic of Peto's paradox seems to be applicable to other traits that promote tumorigenesis.},

These emerging research directions are already contributing to urgent efforts to address the primary challenge facing marine microbiologists today: the unprecedented onslaught of anthropogenic environmental change on marine ecosystems. Ocean warming, acidification, nutrient enrichment and seawater stratification have major effects on the microbial nitrogen cycle, but widespread ocean deoxygenation is perhaps the most consequential for the microorganisms involved in both aerobic and anaerobic nitrogen transformation pathways. In turn, these changes feed back to the global cycles of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.

	abstract = {We here propose a one-dimensional spatially explicit phenotype-structured model to analyze selected aspects of avascular tumor progression. In particular, our approach distinguishes viable and necrotic cell fractions. The metabolically active part of the disease is, in turn, differentiated according to a continuous trait, that identifies cell variants with different degrees of motility and proliferation potential. A parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) then governs the spatio-temporal evolution of the phenotypic distribution of active cells within the host tissue. In this respect, active tumor agents are allowed to duplicate, move upon haptotactic and pressure stimuli, and eventually undergo necrosis. The mutual influence between the emerging malignancy and its environment (in terms of molecular landscape) is implemented by coupling the evolution law of the viable tumor mass with a parabolic PDE for oxygen kinetics and a differential equation that accounts for local consumption of extracellular matrix (ECM) elements. The resulting numerical realizations reproduce tumor growth and invasion in a number scenarios that differ for cell properties (i.e., individual migratory behavior, duplication, and mutation potential) and environmental conditions (i.e., level of tissue oxygenation and homogeneity in the initial matrix profile). In particular, our simulations show that, in all cases, more mobile cell variants occupy the front edge of the tumor, whereas more proliferative clones are selected at more internal regions. A necrotic core constantly occupies the bulk of the mass due to nutrient deprivation. This work may eventually suggest some biomedical strategies to partially reduce tumor aggressiveness, i.e., to enhance necrosis of malignant tissue and to promote the presence of more proliferative cell phenotypes over more invasive ones. © 2021},

	abstract = {Increases in temperature and extreme weather events due to global warming can create an environment that is beneficial to mosquito populations, changing and possibly increasing the suitable geographical range for many vector-borne diseases. West Nile Virus (WNV) is a flavivirus, maintained in a mosquito–avian host cycle that is usually asymptomatic but can cause primarily flu-like symptoms in human and equid accidental hosts. In rare circumstances, serious disease and death are possible outcomes for both humans and horses. The main European vector of WNV is the Culex pipiens mosquito. This study examines the effect of environmental temperature on WNV establishment in Europe via Culex pipiens populations through use of a basic reproduction number ((Formula presented.)) model. A metric of thermal suitability derived from (Formula presented.) was developed by collating thermal responses of different Culex pipiens traits and combining them through use of a next-generation matrix. WNV establishment was determined to be possible between 14°C and 34.3°C, with the optimal temperature at 23.7°C. The suitability measure was plotted against monthly average temperatures in 2020 and the number of months with high suitability mapped across Europe. The average number of suitable months for each year from 2013 to 2019 was also calculated and validated with reported equine West Nile fever cases from 2013 to 2019. The widespread thermal suitability for WNV establishment highlights the importance of European surveillance for this disease and the need for increased research into mosquito and bird distribution. © 2022 Crown copyright.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease is marked by intracellular tau aggregates in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and extracellular amyloid aggregates in the default network (DN). Here, we examined codependent structural variations between the MTL’s most vulnerable structure, the hippocampus (HC), and the DN at subregion resolution in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). By leveraging the power of the approximately 40,000 participants of the UK Biobank cohort, we assessed impacts from the protective APOE ε2 and the deleterious APOE ε4 Alzheimer’s disease alleles on these structural relationships. We demonstrate ε2 and ε4 genotype effects on the inter-individual expression of HC-DN co-variation structural patterns at the population level. Across these HC-DN signatures, recurrent deviations in the CA1, CA2/3, molecular layer, fornix’s fimbria, and their cortical partners related to ADRD risk. Analyses of the rich phenotypic profiles in the UK Biobank cohort further revealed male-specific HC-DN associations with air pollution and female-specific associations with cardiovascular traits. We also showed that APOE ε2/2 interacts preferentially with HC-DN co-variation patterns in estimating social lifestyle in males and physical activity in females. Our structural, genetic, and phenotypic analyses in this large epidemiological cohort reinvigorate the often-neglected interplay between APOE ε2 dosage and sex and link APOE alleles to inter-individual brain structural differences indicative of ADRD familial risk. © 2022 Savignac et al.

	abstract = {Keratinocyte cancers (KC) are the most prevalent malignancies in fair-skinned populations, posing a significant medical and economic burden to health systems. KC originate in the epidermis and mainly comprise basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Here, we combined single-cell multi-omics, transcriptomics, and methylomics to investigate the epigenomic dynamics during epidermal differentiation. We identified ~3,800 differentially accessible regions between undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes, corresponding to regulatory regions associated with key transcription factors. DNA methylation at these regions defined AK/cSCC subtypes with epidermal stem cell- or keratinocyte-like features. Using cell-type deconvolution tools and integration of bulk and single-cell methylomes, we demonstrate that these subclasses are consistent with distinct cells-of-origin. Further characterization of the phenotypic traits of the subclasses and the study of additional unstratified KC entities uncovered distinct clinical features for the subclasses, linking invasive and metastatic KC cases with undifferentiated cells-of-origin. Our study provides a thorough characterization of the epigenomic dynamics underlying human keratinocyte differentiation and uncovers novel links between KC cells-of-origin and their prognosis. © 2022 The Authors.

We developed a database using the most up-to-date information from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (4958 virus species) and identified 1479 vertebrate virus species and their host ranges. Viral traits and host ranges were then used as predictors in generalized linear mixed models for three host-associated outcomes – confirmed zoonotic, potential zoonotic and disease emergence. We identified significant interactions between host range and viral characteristics, not previously reported, that influence the zoonotic and emergence potential of viruses. Bat- and livestock-adapted viruses posed high risk, and the risk increased substantially if these viruses were also present in other vertebrates or were not reported from invertebrates. Our model predicted 39 viruses of interest that have never been reported to have zoonotic potential (27) or to potentially become emerging human viruses (12). We conclude that nucleic acid type is important in identifying the zoonotic and emerging potential of viruses. We recommend enhanced surveillance and monitoring of these virus species identified with a zoonotic and emerging potential to mitigate disease outbreaks and future epidemics. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Dependence on multiple nutritional symbionts that form a metabolic unit has evolved many times in insects. Although it has been postulated that host dependence on these metabolically interconnected symbionts is sustained by their high degree of anatomical integration (these symbionts are often housed in distinct symbiotic cells, the bacteriocytes, assembled into a common symbiotic organ, the bacteriome), the developmental aspects of such multipartner systems have received little attention. Aphids of the subfamilies Chaitophorinae and Lachninae typically harbor disymbiotic systems in which the metabolic capabilities of the ancient obligate symbiont Buchnera aphidicola are complemented by those of a more recently acquired nutritional symbiont, often belonging to the species Serratia symbiotica. Here, we used microscopy approaches to finely characterize the tissue tropism and infection dynamics of the disymbiotic system formed by B. aphidicola and S. symbiotica in the Norway maple aphid Periphyllus lyropictus (Chaitophorinae). Our observations show that, in this aphid, the co-obligate symbiont S. symbiotica exhibits a dual lifestyle: intracellular by being housed in large syncytial bacteriocytes embedded between B. aphidicola-containing bacteriocytes in a well-organized compartmentalization pattern, and extracellular by massively invading the digestive tract and other tissues during embryogenesis. This is the first reported case of an obligate aphid symbiont that is internalized in bacteriocytes but simultaneously adopts an extracellular lifestyle. This unusual infection pattern for an obligate insect symbiont suggests that some bacteriocyte-associated obligate symbionts, despite their integration into a cooperative partnership, still exhibit invasive behavior and escape strict compartmentalization in bacteriocytes. IMPORTANCE Multipartner nutritional endosymbioses have evolved many times in insects. In Chaitophorinae aphids, the eroded metabolic capabilities of the ancient obligate symbiont B. aphidicola are complemented by those of more recently acquired symbionts. Here, we report the atypical case of the co-obligate S. symbiotica symbiont associated with P. lyropictus. This bacterium is compartmentalized into bacteriocytes nested into the ones harboring the more ancient symbiont B. aphidicola, reflecting metabolic convergences between the two symbionts. At the same time, S. symbiotica exhibits highly invasive behavior by colonizing various host tissues, including the digestive tract during embryogenesis. The discovery of this unusual phenotype for a co-obligate symbiont reveals a new face of multipartner nutritional endosymbiosis in insects. In particular, it shows that co-obligate symbionts can retain highly invasive traits and suggests that host dependence on these bacterial partners may evolve prior to their strict compartmentalization into specialized host structures.

	abstract = {Environmental impacts of conventional agriculture have generated interest in sustainable agriculture. Biological pest control is a fundamental tool, and ants are key players providing ecological services, as well as some disservices. We have used a meta-analytical approach to investigate the contribution of ants to biological control, considering their effects on pest and natural enemy abundance, plant damage and crop yield. We also evaluated whether the effects of ants are modulated by traits of ants, pests and other natural enemies, as well as by field size, crop system and experiment duration. Overall (considering all meta-analyses), from 52 studies on 17 different crops, we found that ants decrease the abundance of non-honeydew-producing pests, decrease plant damage and increase crop yield (services). In addition, ants decrease the abundance of natural enemies, mainly the generalist ones, and increase honeydew-producing pest abundance (disservices). We show that the pest control and plant protection provided by ants are boosted in shaded crops compared to monocultures. Furthermore, ants increase crop yield in shaded crops, and this effect increases with time. Finally, we bring new insights such as the importance of shaded crops to ant services, providing a good tool for farmers and stakeholders considering sustainable farming practices.  © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The use of phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) as inoculants for the rhizosphere is a well-known strategy to mitigate P-deficiency in plants. However, despite the multiple modes of action to render P available for plants, PSB often fail to deliver in the field as their selection is often based on a single P-solubilizing trait assessed in vitro. Anticipating these shortcomings, we screened 250 isolates originating from rhizosphere-based enriched consortia for the main in vitro P-solubilizing traits, and subsequently grouped the isolates through trait-based HCPC (hierarchical clustering on principal components). Representative isolates of each cluster were tested in an in planta experiment to compare their in vitro P-solubilizing traits with their in planta performance under conditions of P-deprivation. Our data convincingly show that bacterial consortia capable to mitigate P-deficiency in planta were enriched in bacterial isolates that had multiple P-solubilizing traits in vitro and that had the capacity to mitigate plant P-stress in planta under P-deprived conditions. Furthermore, although it was assumed that bacteria that looked promising in vitro would also have a positive effect in planta, our data show that this was not always the case. Opposite, lack of performance in vitro did not automatically result in a lack of performance in planta. These results corroborate the strength of the previously described in planta-based enrichment and selection technique for the isolation of highly efficient rhizosphere competent PSB. © 2022 De Zutter et al.},

	abstract = {We hereby present the first descriptions of human-invasive infections caused by Escherichia marmotae, a recently described species that encompasses the former “Escherichia cryptic clade V.” We describe four cases, one acute sepsis of unknown origin, one postoperative sepsis after cholecystectomy, one spondylodiscitis, and one upper urinary tract infection. Cases were identified through unsystematic queries in a single clinical lab over 6 months. Through genome sequencing of the causative strains combined with available genomes from elsewhere, we demonstrate Es. marmotae to be a likely ubiquitous species containing genotypic virulence traits associated with Escherichia pathogenicity. The invasive isolates were scattered among isolates from a range of nonhuman sources in the phylogenetic analyses, thus indicating inherent virulence in multiple lineages. Pan genome analyses indicate that Es. marmotae has a large accessory genome and is likely to obtain ecologically advantageous traits, such as genes encoding antimicrobial resistance. Reliable identification might be possible by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), but relevant spectra are missing in commercial databases. It can be identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Escherichia marmotae could represent a relatively common human pathogen, and improved diagnostics will provide a better understanding of its clinical importance. IMPORTANCE Escherichia coli is the most common pathogen found in blood cultures and urine and among the most important pathogenic species in the realm of human health. The notion that some of these isolates are not Es. coli but rather another species within the same genus may have implications for what Es. coli constitutes. We only recently have obtained methods to separate the two species, which means that possible differences in important clinical aspects, such as antimicrobial resistance rates, virulence, and phylogenetic structure, may exist.

	abstract = {The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is an invasive pest that devastates the production of tomatoes and other solanaceous vegetables. Since its trans-Atlantic invasion in 2006, T. absoluta has spread and established in many countries across the Afro-Eurasian Supercontinent, causing huge yield losses. This study aimed to determine the relationship between temperature and the life history traits of T. absoluta and provide the thermal thresholds for development using life cycle modelling. Linear and non-linear models were fitted to life table data collected at five constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35◦C, with Relative Humidity 70 ± 5% and photoperiod 12L:12D. Another experiment was conducted at fluctuating temperatures to validate the laboratory results. Tuta absoluta completed its life cycle at temperatures between 15 and 35◦C. The development time ranged between 4.0–11 days, 6.3–16.0 days, and 5.4–20.7 days for egg, larva, and pupa, respectively. The lowest thermal threshold was estimated at 8.10, 7.83, and 11.62◦C, respectively for egg, larva, and pupa. While the optimum temperature for T. absoluta immature stages survival and female fecundity were predicted at a temperature range of 21–23◦C. The intrinsic rate of increase (rm), gross reproductive (GRR), and net reproductive (Ro) rates were significantly higher at temperatures between 20–25◦C. The model validation outcome showed similarities between observed and simulated values for development time, mortality rate, and life table parameters, attesting to the quality of the phenology model. Our results will help in predicting the effect of climate warming on the distribution and population dynamics of T. absoluta. Furthermore, the results could be used to develop management strategies adapted to different agroecological zones. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Climate warming has been observed as the main cause of changes in diversity, community composition, and spatial distribution of different plant and invertebrate species. Due to even stronger warming compared to the global mean, bumblebees in alpine ecosystems are particularly exposed to these changes. To investigate the effects of climate warming, we sampled bumblebees along an elevational gradient, compared the records with data from 1935 and 1936, and related our results to climate models. We found that bumblebee community composition differed significantly between sampling periods and that increasing temperatures in spring were the most plausible factor explaining these range shifts. In addition, species diversity estimates were significantly lower compared to historical records. The number of socio-parasitic species was significantly higher in the historical communities, while recent communities showed increases in climate generalists and forest species at lower elevations. Nevertheless, no significant changes in community-weighted means of a species temperature index (STI) or the number of cold-adapted species were detected, likely due to the historical data resolution. We conclude that the composition and functionality of bumblebee communities in the study area have been significantly affected by climate warming, with changes in land use and vegetation cover likely playing an additional important role. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Timely flowering is a determinative trait for many economically valuable species in the Dendrobium genus of the Orchidaceae family, some of which are used for ornamental and medicinal purposes. D. nobile, a representative species of nobile-type Dendrobium, normally flowers in spring after exposure to sufficient low temperatures in winter. However, flowering can be stopped or disrupted by the untimely application of high temperatures. Little is known about the regulation and the mechanisms behind this switch. In this study, we report two isoforms from the KFK09_017173 locus of the D. nobile genome, named DnFCAγ and DnFCAβ, respectively, that cooperatively regulate flowering in D. nobile. These two isoforms are generated by alternative 3′ polyadenylation of DnFCA (FLOWERING CONTROL LOCUS C in D. nobile) pre-mRNA and contain a distinct 3′-terminus. Both can partially rescue late flowering in the Arabidopsis fca-1 mutant, while in wild-type Arabidopsis, they tend to delay the flowering time. When introduced into the detached axillary buds or young seedlings of D. nobile, both were able to induce the transcription of DnAGL19 (AGAMOUS LIKE 19 in D. nobile) in seedlings, whereas only DnFCAγ was able to suppress the transcription of DnAPL1 (AP1-LIKE 1 in D. nobile) in axillary buds. Furthermore, the time-course change of DnFCAγ accumulation was opposite to that of DnAPL1 in axillary buds, which was remarkable under low temperatures and within a short time after the application of high temperatures, supporting the suggestion that the expression of DnAPL1 can be inhibited by a high accumulation of DnFCAγ in floral buds. In leaves, the accumulation of DnFCAβ was in accordance with that of DnAGL19 and DnFT (FLOWERING LOCUS T in D. nobile) to a large extent, suggesting the activation of the DnAGL19–DnFT pathway by DnFCAβ. Taken together, these results suggest that the DnFCAγ–DnAPL1 pathway in axillary buds and the DnFCAβ–DnAGL19 pathway in the leaves cooperatively promote flowering under low temperatures. The long-term and constant, or untimely, application of high temperatures leads to the constitutive suppression of DnAPL1 by a high level of DnFCAγ in axillary buds, which consequently delays floral development. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The repeated emergence of new genetic variants of PRRSV-2, the virus that causes porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), reflects its rapid evolution and the failure of previous control efforts. Understanding spatiotemporal heterogeneity in variant emergence and spread is critical for future outbreak prevention. Here, we investigate how the pace of evolution varies across time and space, identify the origins of sub-lineage emergence, and map the patterns of the inter-regional spread of PRRSV-2 Lineage 1 (L1)—the current dominant lineage in the U.S. We performed comparative phylogeographic analyses on subsets of 19,395 viral ORF5 sequences collected across the U.S. and Canada between 1991 and 2021. The discrete trait analysis of multiple spatiotemporally stratified sampled sets (n = 500 each) was used to infer the ancestral geographic region and dispersion of each sub-lineage. The robustness of the results was compared to that of other modeling methods and subsampling strategies. Generally, the spatial spread and population dynamics varied across sub-lineages, time, and space. The Upper Midwest was a main spreading hotspot for multiple sub-lineages, e.g., L1C and L1F, though one of the most recent emergence events (L1A(2)) spread outwards from the east. An understanding of historical patterns of emergence and spread can be used to strategize disease control and the containment of emerging variants. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {While droughts, intensified by climate change, have been affecting forests worldwide, pest epidemics are a major source of uncertainty for assessing drought impacts on forest trees. Thus far, little information has documented the adaptability and evolvability of traits related to drought and pests simultaneously. We conducted common-garden experiments to investigate how several phenotypic traits (i.e. height growth, drought avoidance based on water-use efficiency inferred from δ13C and pest resistance based on defence traits) interact in five mature lodgepole pine populations established in four progeny trials in western Canada. The relevance of interpopulation variation in climate sensitivity highlighted that seed-source warm populations had greater adaptive capability than cold populations. In test sites, warming generated taller trees with higher δ13C and increased the evolutionary potential of height growth and δ13C across populations. We found, however, no pronounced gradient in defences and their evolutionary potential along populations or test sites. Response to selection was weak in defences across test sites, but high for height growth particularly at warm test sites. Response to the selection of δ13C varied depending on its selective strength relative to height growth. We conclude that warming could promote the adaptability and evolvability of growth response and drought avoidance with a limited evolutionary influence from pest (biotic) pressures. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Sucrose is essential for plants for several reasons: It is a source of energy, a signaling molecule, and a source of carbon skeletons. Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) catalyzes the conversion of uridine diphosphate glucose and fructose-6-phosphate to sucrose-6-phosphate, which is rapidly dephosphorylated by sucrose phosphatase. SPS is critical in the accumulation of sucrose because it catalyzes an irreversible reaction. In Arabidopsis thaliana, SPSs form a gene family of four members, whose specific functions are not clear yet. In the present work, the role of SPSA2 was investigated in Arabidopsis under both control and drought stress conditions. In seeds and seedlings, major phenotypic traits were not different in wild-type compared with spsa2 knockout plants. By contrast, 35-day-old plants showed some differences in metabolites and enzyme activities even under control conditions. In response to drought, SPSA2 was transcriptionally activated, and the divergences between the two genotypes were higher, with spsa2 showing reduced proline accumulation and increased lipid peroxidation. Total soluble sugars and fructose concentrations were about halved compared with wild-type plants, and the plastid component of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway was activated. Unlike previous reports, our results support the involvement of SPSA2 in both carbon partitioning and drought response. © 2023 by the authors.},

Despite this, whether variation in the paternal social environment also influences offspring reproductive potential in an intergenerational context has not yet been examined. Here, we studied the descendants of wild-caught house mice, a destructive pest species worldwide, to address this knowledge gap. We analysed traits that define a 'competitive' phenotype in the sons of males (sires) that had been exposed to either a high-male density (competitive) or high-female density (non-competitive) environment. We report disparate reproductive strategies among the sires: high-male density led to a phenotype geared for competition, while high-female density led to a phenotype that would facilitate elevated mating frequency. Moreover, we found that the competitive responses of sires persisted in the subsequent generation, with the sons of males reared under competition having elevated sperm quality. As all sons were reared under common-garden conditions, variation in their reproductive phenotypes could only have arisen via nongenetic inheritance. We discuss our results in relation to the adaptive advantage of preparing sons for sperm competition and suggest that intergenerational plasticity is a previously unconsidered aspect in invasive mammal fertility control.  © 2023 The Author(s).},

Dark diversity links regional and local scales and, over time, reveals taxa under expansion lags by depicting the potential biodiversity that remains suitable but is absent locally. Since global change effects on biodiversity are both spatially and temporally scale dependent, examining long-term temporal dynamics in observed and dark diversity would be relevant to assessing and foreseeing biodiversity change. Here, we used sedimentary pollen data to examine how both taxonomic and functional observed and dark diversity changed over the past 14 500 years in northern Europe. We found that taxonomic and functional observed and dark diversity increased over time, especially after the Late Glacial and during the Late Holocene. However, dark diversity dynamics revealed expansion lags related to species' functional characteristics (dispersal limitation and stress intolerance) and an extensive functional redundancy when compared to taxa in observed diversity. We highlight that assessing observed and dark diversity dynamics is a promising tool to examine biodiversity change across spatial scales, its possible causes, and functional consequences.  © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Most lizards lay eggs inside nests where embryos experience daily fluctuations in temperature. As embryos are sensitive to exposure to high temperatures, increases in nest temperatures may pose a risk to lizards. In the velvet gecko Amalosia lesueurii, nest temperatures are positively correlated with air temperatures, so nests may get hotter in future. However, maternal variation in oviposition site choice might buffer populations from future warming. To evaluate the consequences of oviposition site choice, we incubated eggs under two fluctuating temperature regimes that mimicked temperatures experienced inside sun-exposed (“warm”: mean = 25.4 °C; range = 16.5–35.5 °C) and shaded (“cold”: mean = 23.3 °C; 17.5–30.5 °C) communal nests. We measured the phenotypic traits of hatchlings, released them to the wild, and monitored their survival over 6 months. Warm-incubated hatchlings hatched 15 days earlier, on average, and were smaller than their cold-incubated clutch mates. Incubation treatment did not influence the apparent survival of hatchlings. Hence, even if air temperatures increase by 2 °C in future, thermal regimes inside some currently used shaded nests will be suitable for embryo development. Maternal variation in nest site choice may therefore allow southern populations of the velvet gecko to persist in changing environments. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The increasing occurrence of drought is a global challenge that threatens food security through direct impacts to both plants and their interacting soil microorganisms. Plant growth promoting microbes are increasingly being harnessed to improve plant performance under stress. However, the magnitude of microbiome impacts on both structural and physiological plant traits under water limited and water replete conditions are not well-characterized. Using two microbiomes sourced from a ponderosa pine forest and an agricultural field, we performed a greenhouse experiment that used a crossed design to test the individual and combined effects of the water availability and the soil microbiome composition on plant performance. Specifically, we studied the structural and leaf functional traits of maize that are relevant to drought tolerance. We further examined how microbial relationships with plant phenotypes varied under different combinations of microbial composition and water availability. We found that water availability and microbial composition affected plant structural traits. Surprisingly, they did not alter leaf function. Maize grown in the forest-soil microbiome produced larger plants under well-watered and water-limited conditions, compared to an agricultural soil community. Although leaf functional traits were not significantly different between the watering and microbiome treatments, the bacterial composition and abundance explained significant variability in both plant structure and leaf function within individual treatments, especially water-limited plants. Our results suggest that bacteria-plant interactions that promote plant performance under stress depend upon the greater community composition and the abiotic environment. IMPORTANCE Globally, drought is an increasingly common and severe stress that causes significant damage to agricultural and wild plants, thereby threatening food security. Despite growing evidence of the potential benefits of soil microorganisms on plant performance under stress, decoupling the effects of the microbiome composition versus the water availability on plant growth and performance remains a challenge. We used a highly controlled and replicated greenhouse experiment to understand the impacts of microbial community composition and water limitation on corn growth and drought-relevant functions. We found that both factors affected corn growth, and, interestingly, that individual microbial relationships with corn growth and leaf function were unique to specific watering/microbiome treatment combinations. This finding may help explain the inconsistent success of previously identified microbial inocula in improving plant performance in the face of drought, outside controlled environments. © 2023 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Drought causes massive crop quality and yield losses. Limiting the adverse effects of water deficits on crop yield is an urgent goal for a more sustainable agriculture. With this aim, six chicory varieties were subjected to drought conditions during seed germination and at the six week-old plant growth stage, in order to identify some morphological and/or molecular markers of drought resistance. Selvatica, Zuccherina di Trieste and Galatina varieties, with a high vegetative development, showed a major germination index, greater seedling development (6 days of growth) and a greater dehydration resistance (6 weeks of growth plus 10 days without water) than the other ones (Brindisina, Esportazione and Rossa Italiana). Due to the reported involvement, in the abiotic stress response, of xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) and late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) multigene families, XTH29 and LEA4 expression profiles were investigated under stress conditions for all analyzed chicory varieties. We showed evidence that chicory varieties with high CiXTH29 and CiLEA4 basal expression and vegetative development levels better tolerate drought stress conditions than varieties that show overexpression of the two genes only in response to drought. Other specific morphological traits characterized almost all chicory varieties during dehydration, i.e., the appearance of lysigen cavities and a general increase of the amount of xyloglucans in the cell walls of bundle xylem vessels. Our results highlighted that high CiXTH29 and CiLEA4 basal expression, associated with a high level of vegetative growth, is a potential marker for drought stress tolerance. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic increases in temperature and nutrient loads will likely impact food web structure and stability. Although their independent effects have been reasonably well studied, their joint effects - particularly on coupled ecological and phenotypic dynamics - remain poorly understood. Here we experimentally manipulated temperature and nutrient levels in microbial food webs and used time-series analysis to quantify the strength of reciprocal effects between ecological and phenotypic dynamics across trophic levels. We found that (1) joint - often interactive - effects of temperature and nutrients on ecological dynamics are more common at higher trophic levels, (2) temperature and nutrients interact to shift the relative strength of top-down versus bottom-up control, and (3) rapid phenotypic change mediates observed ecological responses to changes in temperature and nutrients. Our results uncover how feedback between ecological and phenotypic dynamics mediate food web responses to environmental change. This suggests important but previously unknown ways that temperature and nutrients might jointly control the rapid eco-phenotypic feedback that determine food web dynamics in a changing world.  © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The qualitative trials were conducted by exposing earthworms to diverse contaminants sources using standard earthworms’ avoidance tests (considered useful ab initio indicators). For two years, we observed the Jiu River pollution points. We observed soil traits in 15 sampling points from two neighboring Romanian counties where Jiu River flows, by evaluating the risk of pollution on Eisenia fetida earthworms. The ISO: 11268-2:2015 acute static test was used, following the ethological and bodily features of E. fetida earthworms for 14 days, and then the results obtained for clean soils vs. those presumed polluted were statistically analyzed. Results disclosed statistically significant values (p < 0.05) for the two-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparisons tests used for the soil samples thought to be polluted. The mortality percentages by location/replica/year/county find out a high statistical correlation documenting observations related to soil samples gathered from 10 m (p < 0.01) and 30 m (p < 0.001). Compared with the control, the statistical analysis of Relative Growth Rate (RGR) (p < 0.05) and Specific Growth Rate (SGR) (p <0.01) confirmed that, in the case of soil samples collected from 10 and 30 m from the Jiu River’s axis, the earthworms did not gain weight, qualitatively attesting the pollution suspicion/presence of chemical factors potentially pernicious for earthworms. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Theoretically, parents can adjust vital offspring traits to the irregular and rapid occurrence of heat waves via developmental plasticity. However, the direction and strength of such trait modifications are often species-specific. Here, we investigated within-generational plasticity (WGP) and trans-generational plasticity (TGP) effects induced by heat waves during the offspring development of the predator Phytoseiulus persimilis and its herbivorous prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, to assess plastic developmental modifications. Single offspring individuals with different parental thermal origin (reared under mild or extreme heat waves) of both species were exposed to mild or extreme heat waves until adulthood, and food consumption, age and size at maturity were recorded. The offspring traits were influenced by within-generational plasticity (WGP), trans-generational plasticity (TGP), non-plastic trans-generational effects (TGE) and/or their interactions. When exposed to extreme heat waves, both species speeded up development (exclusively WGP), consumed more (due to the fact of WGP but also to TGP in prey females and to non-plastic TGE in predator males), and predator females got smaller (non-plastic TGE and WGP), whereas prey males and females were equally sized irrespective of their origin, because TGE, WGP and TGP acted in opposite directions. The body sizes of predator males were insensitive to parental and offspring heat wave conditions. Species comparisons indicated stronger reductions in the developmental time and reduced female predator-prey body size ratios in favor of the prey under extreme heat waves. Further investigations are needed to evaluate, whether trait modifications result in lowered suppression success of the predator on its prey under heat waves or not. © 2022 by the authors.},

We assessed a total of 636 cases of patients with E. coli UTIs occurring in June 2019 in eight tertiary hospitals in South Korea for the traits of patients with E. coli UTIs, UTI-causative E. coli isolates, and risk factors associated with bloodstream infections (BSIs) secondary to UTIs. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using the disc diffusion method, and the genes for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated ampC genes were screened by using PCR and sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing and virulence pheno-/genotyping were carried out. A total of 49 cases developed BSIs. The E. coli urine isolates primarily comprised sequence type 131 (ST131) (30.0%), followed by ST1193, ST95, ST73, and ST69. Three-quarters of the ST131 H30Rx isolates possessed the blaCTX-M-15-like gene, whereas 66% of H30R and 50% of H41 isolates possessed the blaCTX-M-14-like gene. All the ST1193 isolates showed biofilm formation ability, and three-quarters of the ST73 isolates exhibited hemolytic activity with high proportions of papC, focG, and cnf1 positivity. The prevalence of the ST131 H41 sublineage and its abundant CTX-M possession among the E. coli urine isolates were noteworthy; however, no specific STs were associated with bloodstream invasion. For BSIs secondary to UTIs, the papC gene was likely identified as a UTI-causative E. coli-related risk factor and urogenital cancer (odds ratio [OR], 12.328), indwelling catheter (OR, 3.218), and costovertebral angle tenderness (OR, 2.779) were patient-related risk factors. © 2022 Choi et al.},

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) inoculation in rice plants may be a viable and environmentally acceptable method of sustaining the development and yield of drought-stressed rice plants. The current study focused on the alleviation of drought in the early stages of rice variety CO 51 using PGPR isolated from the rhizosphere of xerophytes. The seeds were treated with bio inocu-lants and subjected to different moisture stress levels (10%, 20% and 30%) using PEG 6000. The seeds treated with bio inocu-lants exhibited higher germination percentage and growth traits such as shoot length root length and fresh weight, especially seeds treated with Bacillus velezensis VKSB5 (MT729963), and Bacillus altitudinis MLSB2 (MT729964) over uninoculated plants. This was found to be due to the increased proline accumulation and antioxidant activity in these seedlings, which plays a major role in drought alleviation by altering the osmotic potential and by its ROS scavenging mechanism. Hence this study pro-vides evidence for the effective drought ameliorating ability of these cultures during the initial growth stages of rice. Further studies can contribute to the development of effective bio-inoculants for the mitigation of drought in rice. © 2022, Applied and Natural Science Foundation. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Listeriosis is a serious food-borne illness, especially in susceptible populations, including children, pregnant women, and elderlies. The disease can occur in two forms: non-invasive febrile gastroenteritis and severe invasive listeriosis with septicemia, meningoencephalitis, perinatal infections, and abortion. Expression of each symptom depends on various bacterial virulence factors, immunological status of the infected person, and the number of ingested bacteria. Internalins, mainly InlA and InlB, invasins (invasin A, LAP), and other surface adhesion proteins (InlP1, InlP4) are responsible for epithelial cell binding, whereas internalin C (InlC) and actin assembly-inducing protein (ActA) are involved in cell-to-cell bacterial spread. L. monocytogenes is able to disseminate through the blood and invade diverse host organs. In persons with impaired immunity, the elderly, and pregnant women, the pathogen can also cross the blood–brain and placental barriers, which results in the invasion of the central nervous system and fetus infection, respectively. The aim of this comprehensive review is to summarize the current knowledge on the epidemiology of listeriosis and L. monocytogenes virulence mechanisms that are involved in host infection, with a special focus on their molecular and cellular aspects.

	abstract = {Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an emerging tick-borne human disease in Spain. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics and exposure risk determinants of CCHF virus (CCHFV) in animal models is essential to predict the time and areas of highest transmission risk. With this goal, we designed a longitudinal survey of two wild ungulate species, the red deer (Cervus elaphus) and the Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), in Doñana National Park, a protected Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot with high ungulate and CCHFV vector abundance, and which is also one of the main stopover sites for migratory birds between Africa and western Europe. Both ungulates are hosts to the principal CCHFV vector in Spain, Hyalomma lusitanicum. We sampled wild ungulates annually from 2005 to 2020 and analysed the frequency of exposure to CCHFV by a double-antigen ELISA. The annual exposure risk was modelled as a function of environmental traits in an approach to understanding exposure risk determinants that allow us to predict the most likely places and years for CCHFV transmission. The main findings show that H. lusitanicum abundance is a fundamental driver of the fine-scale spatial CCHFV transmission risk, while inter-annual risk variation is conditioned by virus/vector hosts, host community structure and weather variations. The most relevant conclusion of the study is that the emergence of CCHF in Spain might be associated with recent wild ungulate population changes promoting higher vector abundance. This work provides relevant insights into the transmission dynamics of CCHFV in enzootic scenarios that would allow deepening the understanding of the ecology of CCHFV and its major determinants. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Great efforts have been made to improve the soil and water conservation capacity by restoring plant communities in different climatic and land-use types. However, how to select suitable species from local species pools that not only adapt to different site environments, but also achieve certain soil and water conservation capacities is a great challenge in vegetation restoration for practitioners and scientists. So far, little attention has been paid to plant functional response and effect traits related to environment resource and ecosystem functions. In this study, together with soil properties and ecohydrological functions, we measured the seven plant functional traits for the most common species in different restoration communities in a subtropical mountain ecosystem. Multivariate optimization analyses were performed to identify the functional effect types and functional response types based on specific plant traits. We found that the community-weighted means of traits differed significantly among the four community types, and the plant functional traits were strongly linked with soil physicochemical properties and ecohydrological functions. Based on three optimal effect traits (specific leaf area, leaf size, and specific root length) and two response traits (specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen concentration), seven functional effect types in relation to the soil and water conservation capacity (interception of canopy and stemflow, maximum water-holding capacity of litter, maximum water-holding capacity of soil, soil surface runoff, and soil erosion) and two plant functional response types to soil physicochemical properties were identified. The redundancy analysis showed that the sum of all canonical eigenvalues only accounted for 21.6% of the variation in functional response types, which suggests that community effects on soil and water conservation cannot explain the overall structure of community responses related to soil resources. The eight overlapping species between the plant functional response types and functional effect types were ultimately selected as the key species for vegetation restoration. Based on the above results, we offer an ecological basis for choosing the appropriate species based on functional traits, which may be very helpful for practitioners involved in ecological restoration and management. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Bacteria of the genus Pectobacterium are globally occurring pathogens that infect a broad spectrum of plants. The plant cell wall degrading enzymes allow them to cause diseases like soft rot and blackleg. Worldwide trade and exchange of plant material together with the accompanying microorganisms contributed to the rapid spread and consequently the acquisition of new traits by bacteria. The 161 pectinolytic strains were isolated from symptomless vegetables and ornamental plants acquired from Polish and foreign local food markets. All strains except four Dickeya isolates were identified as belonging to the Pectobacterium genus by PCR with species-specific primers and recA gene sequencing. The newly isolated bacteria were assigned to eight species, P. versatile (50 strains), P. carotovorum (33), P. brasiliense (27), P. atrosepticum (19), P. parmentieri (12), P. polaris (11), P. parvum (3) and P. odoriferum (2). ERIC PCR and phenotypic characteristics revealed high hetero-geneity among P. carotovorum, P. brasiliense and P. versatile isolates. Moreover, a subset of the newly isolated strains was characterised by high tolerance to changing environmental conditions such as salinity, pH and water availability. These bacteria can effectively macerate the tissues of various plants, including potato, chicory and orchid. Our results indicate that Pectobacterium strains isolated from internationally traded, symptomless vegetables and ornamental plants have high potential for adaptation to adverse environmental conditions and to infect various host plants. These features may contribute to the success of the genus Pectobacterium in spreading between different climatic zones and facilitate the colonisation of different ecological niches. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Fungicide applications in agriculture and medicine can promote the evolution of resistant, pathogenic fungi, which is a growing problem for disease management in both settings. Nonpathogenic mycobiota are also exposed to fungicides, may become tolerant, and could turn into agricultural or medical problems, for example, due to climate change or in immunocompromised individuals. However, quantitative data about fungicide sensitivity of environmental fungi is mostly lacking. Aureobasidium species are widely distributed and frequently isolated yeast-like fungi. One species, A. pullulans, is used as a biocontrol agent, but is also encountered in clinical samples, regularly. Here, we compared 16 clinical and 30 agricultural Aureobasidium isolates based on whole-genome data and by sensitivity testing with the 3 fungicides captan, cyprodinil, and difenoconazole. Our phylogenetic analyses determined that 7 of the 16 clinical isolates did not belong to the species A. pullulans. These isolates clustered with other Aureobasidium species, including A. melanogenum, a recently separated species that expresses virulence traits that are mostly lacking in A. pullulans. Interestingly, the clinical Aureobasidium isolates were significantly more fungicide sensitive than many isolates from agricultural samples, which implies selection for fungicide tolerance of non-target fungi in agricultural ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Environmental microbiota are regularly found in clinical samples and can cause disease, in particular, in immunocompromised individuals. Organisms of the genus Aureobasidium belonging to this group are highly abundant, and some species are even described as pathogens. Many A. pullulans isolates from agricultural samples are tolerant to different fungicides, and it seems inevitable that such strains will eventually appear in the clinics. Selection for fungicide tolerance would be particularly worrisome for species A. melanogenum, which is also found in the environment and exhibits virulence traits. Based on our observation and the strains tested here, clinical Aureobasidium isolates are still fungicide sensitive. We, therefore, suggest monitoring fungicide sensitivity in species, such as A. pullulans and A. melanogenum, and to consider the development of fungicide tolerance in the evaluation process of fungicides.

We emphasize a holistic view integrating an economically and ecologically sustainable control of infestations and transmitted pathogens by R. microplus in the Neotropics. Examples of research link the trends of climate, the composition of the community of hosts, the landscape features, and a tailored management based on ecological grounds. Our view is that factors driving the spread of R. microplus are complex and deeply interrelated, something that has been seldom considered in control strategies. The effects of climate may affect the dynamics of wildlife or the landscape composition, promoting new patterns of seasonal activity of the tick, or its spread into currently free areas.

	abstract = {Previous studies and efforts to prevent and manage avian influenza (AI) outbreaks have mainly focused on the wintering season. However, outbreaks of AI have been reported in the summer, including the breeding season of waterfowl. Additionally, the spatial distribution of waterfowl can easily change during the annual cycle due to their life-cycle traits and the presence of both migrants and residents in the population. Thus, we assessed the spatiotemporal variation in AI exposure risk in poultry due to spatial distribution changes in three duck species included in both major residents and wintering migrants in South Korea, the mandarin, mallard and spot-billed duck, during wintering (October–March), breeding (April–June) and whole annual seasons. To estimate seasonal ecological niche variations among the three duck species, we applied pairwise ecological niche analysis using the Pianka index. Subsequently, seasonal distribution models were projected by overlaying the monthly ranges estimated by the maximum entropy model. Finally, we overlaid each seasonal distribution range onto a poultry distribution map of South Korea. We found that the mandarin had less niche overlap with the mallard and spot-billed duck during the wintering season than during the breeding season, whereas the mallard had less niche overlap with the mandarin and spot-billed duck during the breeding season than during the wintering season. Breeding and annual distribution ranges of the mandarin and spot-billed duck, but not the mallard, were similar or even wider than their wintering ranges. Similarly, the mandarin and spot-billed duck showed more extensive overlap proportions between poultry and their distributional ranges during both the breeding and annual seasons than during the wintering season. These results suggest that potential AI exposure in poultry can occur more widely in the summer than in winter, depending on sympatry with the host duck species. Future studies considering the population density and variable pathogenicity of AI are required. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Many animals are highly mobile and have evolved long-distance migrations that make them actors in multiple ecosystems through the year and throughout their life. Most long-distance migrations are adaptations to seasonality and more generally to spatio-temporal patterns in food availability, weather, risk of parasite and pathogen infections, and predation risk. Due to the considerable seasonality in high-latitude environments, with Arctic as extremes, long-distance seasonal migrations are a distinct characteristic of the fauna in these Northern regions. The Arctic is also a seasonal melting pot during the productive summer, when large numbers of organism move in from all over the world. Travelling animals connect ecosystems and serve as spatial vectors, of energy and nutrients and of other organisms that follow (sometimes as active hitchhikers) for parts or the entire route. We provide an overview of central concepts and main spatial and temporal (phenology) patterns of animal migrations, with a focus on migrations to and from as well as within northern regions (i.e. arctic and sub-arctic regions). In particular, we characterize the role of migratory animals as vectors and hosts for infectious agents, and we discuss the concepts of migratory escape, migratory culling, and migratory separation. Understanding drivers and patterns of migrations is essential for understanding the dynamics of diseases and must therefore be considered in veterinary and human medicine and the One Health perspective. We show how climate change and human stressors impact migrations and how these changes may interact with the animals’ capacity to transport parasites and other infectious agents. Throughout, we stress the evolutionary ecology of migrations, a plastic trait under natural selection with complex ecological consequences. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {With the looming threat of abrupt ecological disruption due to a changing climate, predicting which species are most vulnerable to environmental change is critical. The life-history of a species is an evolved response to its environmental context, and therefore a promising candidate for explaining differences in climate-change responses. However, we need broad empirical assessments from across the worlds ecosystems to explore the link between life-history and climate-change responses. Here, we use long-term abundance records from 157 species of terrestrial mammal and a two-step Bayesian meta-regression framework to investigate the link between annual weather anomalies, population growth rates, and species-level life-history. Overall, we found no directional effect of temperature or precipitation anomalies or variance on annual population growth rates. Furthermore, population responses to weather anomalies were not predicted by phylogenetic covariance, and instead there was more variability in weather responses for populations within a species. Crucially, however, long-lived mammals with smaller litter sizes had smaller absolute population responses to weather anomalies compared to their shorter-living counterparts with larger litters. These results highlight the role of species-level life-history in driving responses to the environment. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Along with population growth, global climate change represents a critical threat to agricultural production, compromising the goal of achieving food and nutrition security for all. It is urgent to create sustainable and resilient agri-food systems capable of feeding the world without debilitating the planet. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) refers to pulses as a superfood, as one of the most nutritious crops with high health benefits. Considered to be low-cost, many can be produced in arid lands and have an extended shelf-life. Their cultivation helps reduce greenhouse gases and increases carbon sequestration, also improving soil fertility. Cowpea, Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. is particularly drought tolerant, with a wide diversity of landraces adapted to different environments. Considering the importance of knowing and valuing the genetic variability of this species in Portugal, this study assessed the impact of drought on four landraces of cowpea (L1 to L4) from different regions of the country and a national commercial variety (CV) as a reference. The development and evaluation of morphological characteristics were monitored in response to terminal drought (imposed during the reproductive phase), and its effects were evaluated on the yield and quality of the produced grain, namely the weight of 100 grains, color, protein content, and soluble sugars. Under drought conditions, the landraces L1 and L2 showed early maturation as a strategy to avoid water deficit. Morphological alteration of the aerial part of the plants was evident in all genotypes, with a rapid reduction in the number of leaves and a reduction in the number of flowers and pods by between 44 and 72%. The parameters of grain quality, the weight of 100 grains, color, protein, and soluble sugars did not vary significantly, except for sugars of the raffinose family that is associated with the adaptive mechanisms of plants to drought. The performance and maintenance of the evaluated characteristics reflect the adaptation acquired in the past by exposure to the Mediterranean climate, highlighting the potential agronomic and genetic value, still little exploited, that could contribute to production stability, preserved nutritional value, and food safety under water stress. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Cutibacterium acnes, formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes, is a commensal of the human pilosebaceous unit but also causes deep-seated infection, especially in the context of orthopedic and neurosurgical foreign materials. Interestingly, little is known about the role of specific pathogenicity factors for infection establishment. Here, 86 infection-Associated and 103 commensalism-Associated isolates of C. acnes were collected from three independent microbiology laboratories. We sequenced the whole genomes of the isolates for genotyping and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). We found that C. acnes subsp. acnes IA1 was the most significant phylotype among the infection isolates (48.3% of all infection isolates; odds ratio [OR] = 1.98 for infection). Among the commensal isolates, C. acnes subsp. acnes IB was the most significant phylotype (40.8% of all commensal isolates; OR = 0.5 for infection). Interestingly, C. acnes subsp. elongatum (III) was rare overall and did not occur at all in infection. The open reading frame-based GWAS (ORF-GWAS) did not show any loci with a strong signal for infection association (no P values of #0.05 after adjustment for multiple testing; no logarithmic OR [logOR] of 2j). We concluded that all subspecies and phylotypes of C. acnes, possibly with the exception of C. acnes subsp. elongatum, are able to cause deepseated infection given favorable conditions, most importantly related to inserted foreign material. Genetic content appears to have a small effect on the likelihood of infection establishment, and functional studies are needed to understand the individual factors contributing to deep-seated infections caused by C. acnes. IMPORTANCE Opportunistic infections emerging from human skin microbiota are of ever-increasing importance. Cutibacterium acnes, being abundant on the human skin, may cause deep-seated infections (e.g., device-Associated infections). Differentiation between invasive (i.e., clinically significant) C. acnes isolates and sole contaminants is often difficult. Identification of genetic markers associated with invasiveness not only would strengthen our knowledge related to pathogenesis but also could open ways to selectively categorize invasive and contaminating isolates in the clinical microbiology lab. We show that in contrast to other opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis), invasiveness is apparently a broadly distributed ability across almost all C. acnes subspecies and phylotypes. Thus, our work strongly supports an approach in which clinical significance is judged from clinical context rather than by detecting specific genetic traits. © 2023 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Agronomic traits of plants especially those of economic or aesthetic importance are threatened by climatic and environmental factors such as climate change, biotic, and abiotic stresses. These threats are now being mitigated through the analyses of omics data like genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics. The emergence of high-throughput omics technology has led to an avalanche of plant omics data. Plant research demands novel analytical paradigms to extract and harness large plant omics data for plant improvement effectively and efficiently. Machine learning algorithms are well-suited analytical and computational approaches for the integrative analysis of large unstructured, heterogeneous datasets. This study presents an overview of omics approaches to improve plant agronomic traits and crucial curated plant genomic data sources. Furthermore, we summarize machine learning algorithms and software tools/programming packages used in plant omics research. Lastly, we discuss advancements in machine learning algorithms' applications in improving agronomic traits of economically important plants. Extensive application of machine learning would advance plant omics studies. These advancements would consequently help agricultural scientists improve economically important plants’ quality, yield, and tolerance against abiotic and biotic stresses and other plant health-threatening issues.

Understanding the timing, geographical patterns and drivers of past changes in insect communities is essential for evaluating the biodiversity implications of future climate changes, yet our knowledge of long-term patterns is limited. We applied a network modelling approach to the recent fossil record of northwestern European beetles to investigate how their taxonomic and trait composition changed during the past 16 000 years. We found two major changes in beetle faunas 4000-3500 and 10 000-9500 years ago, coinciding with periods of human population growth in the Late Holocene and climate warming in the Early Holocene.

This insect/fungus complex arises from the intense trophic activity of the bark beetle vector Pityophthorus juglandis in the phloem of Juglans spp. and the subsequent development of multiple Geosmithia morbida cankers around beetles’ entry/exit holes. After an analysis of the main biological and ecological traits of both members of this insect/fungus complex, this review explores the options available for TCD prevention and management. Special focus is given to those diagnostic tools developed for disease detection, surveillance, and monitoring, as well as to existing phytosanitary regulations, protocols, and measures that comply with TCD eradication and containment.

	abstract = {Chitin and chitosan are well-known natural polymers that have been considered a sustainable feedstock for the production of high-value biomaterials. In particular, the wide availability of the main sources of chitin, e.g., squid pens, shrimp, crab shells, insects, and fungal cell walls, is associated to different methodologies for its extraction, namely, classical methods based on strong acids, alkali, and enzymes, or alternative ones like the use of ionic liquids and/or natural deep eutectic solvents. The latter method offers opportunities to extract and process chitin directly from the raw materials, preserving the chitin qualities. The global market of chitin is continuously increasing across different fields, namely, the textile industry, packaging, technology, and biomedical field. In the biomedical field, many chitin and chitosan-based matrices, namely, membranes, hydrogels, nano/microfibers, and scaffolds have been produced using various methodologies such as blending chitin and chitosan with other natural/synthetic polymers (such as alginate, gelatin, polycaprolactone), metals and/or ceramics (such as HAp, SiO2, TiO2, ZrO2). Besides, the functional groups of chitin and chitosan can be modified for the development of a broad range of derivatives with a wide range of applications. The achieved architectures have the suitable physicochemical and biological performance for applications in wound repair, bone regeneration, cartilage repair, and infectious diseases.

	abstract = {Invasive bacterial disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in African children. Despite being caused by diverse pathogens, children with sepsis are clinically indistinguishable from one another. In spite of this, most genetic susceptibility loci for invasive infection that have been discovered to date are pathogen specific and are not therefore suggestive of a shared genetic architecture of bacterial sepsis. Here we utilise probabilistic diagnostic models to identify children with a high probability of invasive bacterial disease among critically unwell Kenyan children with P. falciparum parasitaemia. We construct a joint dataset including 1,445 bacteraemia cases and 1,143 severe malaria cases, and population controls, among critically unwell Kenyan children that have previously been genotyped for human genetic variation. Using these data we perform a cross-trait genome-wide association study of invasive bacterial infection, weighting cases according to their probability of bacterial disease. In doing so we identify and validate a novel risk locus for invasive infection secondary to multiple bacterial pathogens, that has no apparent effect on malaria risk. The locus identified modifies splicing of BIRC6 in stimulated monocytes, implicating regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in the pathogenesis of sepsis in Kenyan children. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {A principal objective in agriculture is to maximise food production; this is particularly relevant with the added demands of an ever increasing population, coupled with the unpredictability that climate change brings. Further improvements in productivity can only be achieved with an increased understanding of plant and crop processes. In this respect, mathematical modelling of plants and crops plays an important role. In this paper we present a two-scale mathematical model of crop yield that accounts for plant growth and canopy interactions. A system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is formulated to describe the growth of each individual plant, where equations are coupled via a term that describes plant competition via canopy–canopy interactions. A crop of greenhouse plants is then modelled via an agent based modelling approach in which the growth of each plant is described via our system of ODEs. The model is formulated for the African drought tolerant legume bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea), which is currently being investigated as a food source in light of climate change and food insecurity challenges. Our model allows us to account for plant diversity and also investigate the effect of individual plant traits (e.g. plant canopy size and planting distance) on the yield of the overall crop. Informed with greenhouse data, model results show that plant positioning relative to other plants has a large impact on individual plant yield. Variation in physiological plant traits from genetic diversity and the environmental effects lead to experimentally observed variations in crop yield. These traits include plant height, plant carrying capacity, leaf accumulation rate and canopy spread. Of these traits plant height and ground cover growth rates are found to have the greatest impact on crop yield. We also consider a range of different planting arrangements (uniform grid, staggered grid, circular rings and random allocation) and find that the staggered grid leads to the greatest crop yield (6% more compared to uniform grid). Whilst formulated specifically for bambara groundnut, the generic formulation of our model means that with changes to certain parameter's, it may be extended to other crop species that form a canopy. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus haemolyticus is one of the most important nosocomial human pathogens frequently isolated in bloodstream and medical device-related infections. However, its mechanisms of evolution and adaptation are still poorly explored. To characterize the strategies of genetic and phenotypic diversity in S. haemolyticus, we analyzed an invasive strain for genetic and phenotypic stability after serial passage in vitro in the absence and presence of beta-lactam antibiotics. We performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of the culture and analyzed five colonies at seven time points during stability assays for beta-lactam susceptibility, hemolysis, mannitol fermentation, and biofilm production. We compared their whole genomes and performed phylogenetic analysis based on core single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We observed a high instability in the PFGE profiles at the different time points in the absence of antibiotic. Analysis of WGS data for individual colonies showed the occurrence of six large-scale genomic deletions within the oriC environ, smaller deletions in non-oriC environ regions, and nonsynonymous mutations in clinically relevant genes. The regions of deletion and point mutations included genes encoding amino acid and metal transporters, resistance to environmental stress and beta-lactams, virulence, mannitol fermentation, metabolic processes, and insertion sequence (IS) elements. Parallel variation was detected in clinically significant phenotypic traits such as mannitol fermentation, hemolysis, and biofilm formation. In the presence of oxacillin, PFGE profiles were overall stable over time and mainly corresponded to a single genomic variant. Our results suggest that S. haemolyticus populations are composed of subpopulations of genetic and phenotypic variants. The maintenance of subpopulations in different physiological states may be a strategy to adapt rapidly to stress situations imposed by the host, particularly in the hospital environment. IMPORTANCE The introduction of medical devices and antibiotics into clinical practice have substantially improved patient quality of life and contributed to extended life expectancy. One of its most cumbersome consequences was the emergence of medical device-associated infections caused by multidrug-resistant and opportunistic bacteria such as Staphylococcus haemolyticus. However, the reason for this bacterium’s success is still elusive. We found that in the absence of environmental stresses, S. haemolyticus can spontaneously produce subpopulations of genomic and phenotypic variants with deletions/mutations in clinically relevant genes. However, when exposed to selective pressures, such as the presence of antibiotics, a single genomic variant will be recruited and become dominant. We suggest that the maintenance of these cell subpopulations in different physiological states is an extremely effective strategy to adapt to stresses imposed by the host or the infection environment and might contribute for S. haemolyticus survival and persistence in the hospital.

	abstract = {Transgenerational plasticity is a form of non-genetic inheritance that can reduce or enhance offspring fitness depending on parental stress. Yet, the adaptive value of such parental environmental effects and whether their expression varies among populations remain largely unknown. We used self-fertilized lines from climatically distinct populations of the crop wild relative Lupinus angustifolius. In the parental generation, full-siblings were grown in two contrasting watering environments. Then, to robustly separate the within-generation and transgenerational response to drought, we reciprocally assigned the offspring of parents to the same experimental treatments. We measured key functional traits and assessed lifetime reproductive fitness. Offspring of drought-stressed parents produced less reproductive biomass, but a similar number of lighter seeds, in dry soil compared to offspring of genetically identical, well-watered parents, an effect not mediated by differences in seed provisioning. Importantly, while the offspring of parents grown in the favourable environment responded to drought by slightly increasing individual seed mass, the pattern of plasticity of the offspring of drought-grown parents showed the opposite direction, and the negative effects of parental drought on seed mass were more pronounced in populations from cooler and moist habitats. Overall, our results show that parental effects may override immediate adaptive responses to drought and provide evidence of population-level variation in the expression of transgenerational plasticity. © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The rhizomicrobiome comprises a wide variety of microorganisms that are essential for microbial colonization and root development in a wide variety of plants. A plant’s growth, development, and defense mechanisms would be impossible without the rhizomicrobiome’s microbes. In order to develop and operate properly, roots are essential to plants because they give structural support and aid in the intake of water and nutrients. This rhizobacteriome, a diverse bacterial population with particular roles that affect plant health, may be found in plant root exudates due to the complex variety of elements present. There are several metabolites produced by the plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in the rhizosphere near the plant roots that stimulate the plant’s development. Many PGPRs have the ability to solubilize phosphate, fix N2, produce biosynthesis of hydrolytic enzymes (hydrolase), produce phytohormones (phytoestrogens), produce siderophores (antibiotics), and more. Climate change, population growth, and the use of herbicides and insecticides have all had a significant influence on crop productivity in recent decades. Studies show that PGPR can boost plant growth and yield in a variety of species. As a result, PGPR dynamic microorganisms can be used as biofertilizers or biopesticides in agricultural techniques, which is critical to alleviating the urgent call for sustainable production. Rhizobacteriome, in particular PGPR found in the rhizosphere, and their many strategies for enhancing plant production are summarized in this chapter. © The Editor(s) (ifapplicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.2022.},

A clear understanding of how both protagonists of biological invasions are characterized is still lacking. We investigated the morphology, life history and ecology of birds involved in biological invasions. Evaluating the distribution of 450 IAS-threatened birds and 400 alien birds in a functional space, we found that both groups retained various strategies. Aliens had larger clutches and were more likely to be herbivores than IAS-threatened and worldwide birds, while IAS-threatened birds were more insular endemic from the Australia region than alien and worldwide birds. IAS-threatened species showed opposite strategies to aliens regarding traits related to diet, origin and reproduction. Further comparing traits associated with impact magnitude, we found that even if aliens were mostly herbivorous, those with high impact had more a generalist behaviour and an animal-based diet compared to aliens with low impact. By emphasizing differences relating to the distribution of bird groups in a functional space, we opened new opportunities to identify the role of birds in biological invasions. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Gut symbiotic bacteria are known to be closely related to insect development, nutrient metabolism, and disease resistance traits, but the most important factors leading to changes in these communities have not been well clarified. To address this, we examined the associations between the gut symbiotic bacteria and the host genotype and geographical distribution of Solenopsis invicta in China, where it is invasive and has spread primarily by human-mediated dispersal. Thirty-two phyla were detected in the gut symbiotic bacteria of S. invicta. Proteobacteria were the most dominant group among the gut symbiotic bacteria. Furthermore, the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices of the gut symbiotic bacteria were significantly positively correlated with the geographical distance between the host ant colonies, but this relationship was affected by the social form. The distance between monogyne colonies had a significant effect on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices of gut symbiotic bacteria, but the distance between polygyne colonies did not. Moreover, the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices were positively correlated with Nei’s genetic distance of the host but were not correlated with the COI-based genetic distance. This study provides a scientific basis for further understanding the ecological adaptability of red imported fire ants during invasion and dispersal. IMPORTANCE We demonstrated that gut microbiota composition and diversity varied among populations. These among-population differences were associated with host genotype and geographical distribution. Our results suggested that population-level differences in S. invicta gut microbiota may depend more on environmental factors than on host genotype. Copyright © 2023 Xiao et al.},

Indeed, it has been shown to increase sperm production in both vertebrates and invertebrates. However, sperm production is energetically costly, which may result in trade-offs among sperm traits. In eusocial hymenopterans, such as ants, mating dynamics impose unique selective pressures on ejaculate. Males are sperm limited: they enter adulthood with a fixed amount of sperm that will not be renewed. We explored whether sperm competition intensity was associated with sperm quantity and quality (i.e. sperm viability and DNA fragmentation) in nine Cataglyphis desert ants. Our results provide phylogenetically robust evidence that sperm competition is positively correlated with sperm production and sperm viability. However, it was unrelated to sperm DNA integrity, indicating the absence of a trade-off involving this trait.

	abstract = {Cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma, frequently invade as multicellular units. However, these invading units can be organised in a variety of ways, ranging from thin discontinuous strands to thick ‘pushing’ collectives. Here we employ an integrated experimental and computational approach to identify the factors that determine the mode of collective cancer cell invasion. We find that matrix proteolysis is linked to the formation of wide strands but has little effect on the maximum extent of invasion. Cell-cell junctions also favour wide strands, but our analysis also reveals a requirement for cell-cell junctions for efficient invasion in response to uniform directional cues. Unexpectedly, the ability to generate wide invasive strands is coupled to the ability to grow effectively when surrounded by extracellular matrix in three-dimensional assays. Combinatorial perturbation of both matrix proteolysis and cell-cell adhesion demonstrates that the most aggressive cancer behaviour, both in terms of invasion and growth, is achieved at high levels of cell-cell adhesion and high levels of proteolysis. Contrary to expectation, cells with canonical mesenchymal traits – no cell-cell junctions and high proteolysis – exhibit reduced growth and lymph node metastasis. Thus, we conclude that the ability of squamous cell carcinoma cells to invade effectively is also linked to their ability to generate space for proliferation in confined contexts. These data provide an explanation for the apparent advantage of retaining cell-cell junctions in squamous cell carcinomas. © Kato, Jenkins et al.},

	abstract = {Sarcoptic mange, a skin infestation caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, is an emerging disease for some species of wildlife, potentially jeopardizing their welfare and conservation. Sarcoptes scabiei has a near-global distribution facilitated by its forms of transmission and use of a large diversity of host species (many of those with broad geographic distribution). In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge concerning the geographic and host taxonomic distribution of mange in wildlife, the epidemiological connections between species, and the potential threat of sarcoptic mange for wildlife conservation. Recent sarcoptic mange outbreaks in wildlife appear to demonstrate ongoing geographic spread, increase in the number of hosts and increased virulence. Sarcoptic mange has been reported in at least 12 orders, 39 families and 148 species of domestic and wild mammals, making it one of the most generalist ectoparasites of mammals. Taxonomically, the orders with most species found infested so far include Perissodactyla (67% species from the entire order), Artiodactyla (47%), and Diprotodontia (67% from this order). This suggests that new species from these mammal orders are likely to suffer cross-species transmission and be reported positive to sarcoptic mange as surveillance improves. We propose a new agenda for the study of sarcoptic mange in wildlife, including the study of the global phylogeography of S. scabiei, linkages between ecological host traits and sarcoptic mange susceptibility, immunology of individuals and species, development of control strategies in wildlife outbreaks and the effects of global environmental change in the sarcoptic mange system. The ongoing transmission globally and sustained spread among areas and wildlife species make sarcoptic mange an emerging panzootic in wildlife. A better understanding of sarcoptic mange could illuminate the aspects of ecological and evolutionary drivers in cross-species transmission for many emerging diseases. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Seasonality, rather than annual precipitation levels, is expected to affect the adaptive responses of plant populations under future climate change. To estimate adaptive traits’ variation, we conducted a common garden experiment with two beech populations from contrasting climatic origins (Evros with longer drought intervals during summer and higher precipitation seasonality, and Drama representing a more temperate ecosystem). We simulated two different watering treatments (frequent vs. non-frequent) on beech seedlings, according to predicted monthly precipitation levels expected to prevail in 2050 by the CSIRO MK3.6 SRESA1B model, considering as reference area a natural beech stand in Mt. Rodopi, Greece. A series of morphological and stem anatomical traits were measured. Seedling survival was greater for the Evros population compared to that of Drama under non-frequent watering, while no difference in survival was detected under frequent watering. Leaf morphological traits were not generally affected by watering frequency except for leaf circularity, which was found to be lower under non-frequent watering for both populations. Stomata density in leaves was found to be higher in the Evros population and lower in the Drama population under non-frequent watering than frequent. Stem anatomical traits were higher under non-frequent watering for Evros but lower for the Drama population. Multivariate analyses clearly discriminated populations under non-frequent rather than frequent watering, indicating genetic adaptation to the population’s environment of origin. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The assumption that differences in species' traits reflect their different niches has long influenced how ecologists infer processes from assemblage patterns. For instance, many assess the importance of environmental filtering versus classical limiting-similarity competition in driving biological invasions by examining whether invaders' traits are similar or dissimilar to those of residents, respectively. However, mounting evidence suggests that hierarchical differences between species' trait values can distinguish their competitive abilities (e.g. for the same resource) instead of their niches. Whether such trait-mediated hierarchical competition explains invasions and structures assemblages is less explored. We integrate morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioural trait analyses to test whether environmental filtering, limiting-similarity competition or hierarchical competition explain invasions by fire ants on ant assemblages. We detect both competition mechanisms; invasion success is not only explained by limiting similarity in body size and thermal tolerance (presumably allowing the invader to exploit different niches from residents), but also by the invader's superior position in trait hierarchies reflecting competition for common trophic resources. We find that the two mechanisms generate complex assemblage-level functional diversity patterns-overdispersion in some traits, clustering in others-suggesting their effects are likely missed by analyses restricted to a few traits and composite trait diversity measures.  © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Laohugou Glacier No. 12 is located on the northern slope of the western Qilian Mountains with a temperate continental wet climate and an extremely cold winter. Bacteria in a newly exposed moraine have to cope with various pressures owing to deglaciation at the glacier snout. However, limited information is available regarding the high diversity and temporary survival of culturable heterotrophic bacteria under various environmental stresses. To examine the tolerance of extremophiles against varying environmental conditions in a newly exposed moraine, we simulated environmental stress in bacterial cultures. The results showed that the isolated strains belonged to actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus, and Firmicutes. Actinobacteria was the most abundant phylum, followed by Proteobacteria, at both high and low temperatures. Pseudarthrobacter was the most abundant genus, accounting for 14.2% of the total isolates. Although several microorganisms grew at 10 °C, the proportion of microorganisms that grew at 25 °C was substantially higher. In particular, 50% of all bacterial isolates grew only at a high temperature (HT), whereas 21.4% of the isolates grew at a low temperature (LT), and 38.6% of the isolates grew at both HT and LT. In addition, many radiation-resistant extremophiles were identified, which adapted to both cold and oxidative conditions. The nearest neighbors of approximately >90% of bacteria belonged to a nonglacial environment, such as oil-contaminated soil, rocks, and black sand, instead of glacial niches. This study provides insights into the ecological traits, stress responses, and temporary survival of culturable heterotrophic bacteria in a newly exposed moraine with variable environmental conditions and the relationship of these communities with the non-glacial environment. This study may help to understand the evolution, competition, and selective growth of bacteria in the transition regions between glaciers and retreats in the context of glacier melting and retreat owing to global warming. © 2022 by the authors.},

Here, we investigate how the loss of understory birds, in the lowest stratum of the forest, affects avian biomass and functional diversity in the Amazon rainforest. Across approximately 30 years in the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, we used a historical baseline of avian communities to contrast the avian communities in today's primary forest with those in modern disturbed habitat. We found that in primary rainforest, the reduced abundance of insectivorous species led to reduced functional diversity, but no reduction of biomass, indicating that species with similar functional traits are less likely to coexist in modern primary forests. Because today's forests contain fewer functionally redundant species - those with similar traits - we argue that avian communities in modern primary Amazonian rainforests are less resilient, which may ultimately disrupt the ecosystem in dynamic and unforeseen ways.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

Here, we show that altered patterns of temperature variance lead to an almost order-of-magnitude shift in thermal performance of host and pathogen life-history traits over and above the effects of mean temperature and, moreover, that different temperature regimes affect these traits differently. We found that diurnal fluctuations of ±3°C lowered infection rates and reduced spore burden compared to constant temperatures in our focal host Daphnia magna exposed to the microsporidium parasite Ordospora colligata. In contrast, a 3-day heatwave (+6°C) did not affect infection rates, but increased spore burden (relative to constant temperatures with the same mean) at 16°C, while reducing burden at higher temperatures. We conclude that changing patterns of climate variation, superimposed on shifts in mean temperatures due to global warming, may have profound and unan-ticipated effects on disease dynamics. © Kunze et al.},

A key hurdle in building more predictive models of rapid evolution is understanding this variation - why do some populations and traits evolve while others do not? We combined long-term demographic and environmental data, estimates of quantitative genetic variance components, a resurrection experiment and individual-based evolutionary simulations to gain mechanistic insights into contrasting evolutionary responses to a severe multi-year drought. We examined five traits in two populations of a native California plant, Clarkia xantiana, at three time points over 7 years. Earlier flowering phenology evolved in only one of the two populations, though both populations experienced similar drought severity and demographic declines and were estimated to have considerable additive genetic variance for flowering phenology. Pairing demographic and experimental data with evolutionary simulations suggested that while seed banks in both populations likely constrained evolutionary responses, a stronger seed bank in the non-evolving population resulted in evolutionary stasis. Gene flow through time via germ banks may be an important, underappreciated control on rapid evolution in response to extreme environmental perturbations.  © 2023 The Author(s).},

Sea level rise (SLR) is one major consequence of climate change that poses a threat to estuaries with extensive intertidal habitats. The ecological implications of intertidal habitat loss have been largely overlooked despite their likely significance. We aimed to address this knowledge gap by investigating how benthic macroinvertebrate communities and their contributions to ecosystem function are likely to respond to SLR. Based on a spatially extensive dataset (119 sites) from a large coastal lagoon, depth, sediment chlorophyll concentrations, mud content, and average current speed were identified as the main drivers of community compositional turnover. Shifts in benthic community structure and associated functional implications were then evaluated using depth as a proxy for SLR. Three main macrofaunal groups representing intertidal, shallow subtidal, and deep subtidal habitats were identified. Functional trait analysis indicated low functional redundancy for a key intertidal suspension-feeding bivalve (Austrovenus stutchburyi) and the lack of a shallow subtidal functional replacement should intertidal habitats become inundated. These findings strongly suggest SLR and the associated environmental changes will alter estuarine macroinvertebrate communities, with implications for future ecosystem function and resilience. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Soil microorganisms play an important role in determining nutrient cycling. The integration of fish into rice fields can influence the diversity and structural composition of soil microbial communities. However, regarding the rice–fish co-culture (RF) farming system in Thailand, the study of the diversity and composition of soil microbes is still limited. Here, we aim to compare the microbial diversity, community composition, and functional structure of the bacterial communities between RF and rice monoculture (MC) farming systems and identify the environmental factors shaping bacterial community composition. Bacterial taxonomy was observed using 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the functional structures of the bacterial communities were predicted based on their taxonomy and sequences. The results showed that soil organic carbon, total nitrogen (TN), organic matter, available phosphorous, and clay content were significantly higher in RF than in MC. The most dominant taxa across both paddy rice fields belonged to Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes. The taxa Nitrosporae, Rokubacteria, GAL15, and Elusimicrobia were significantly different between both rice fields. At the genus level, Bacillus, Anaeromyxobacter, and HSB OF53-F07 were the predominant genera in both rice fields. The most abundant genus in MC was Anaeromyxobacter, whereas RF belonged to Bacillus. The community composition in MC was positively correlated with magnesium and sand content, while in RF was positively correlated with pH, TN, and clay content. Nitrogen fixation, aromatic compound degradation, and hydrocarbon degradation were more abundant in RF, while cellulolysis, nitrification, ureolysis, and phototrophy functional groups were more abundant in MC. The enzymes involved in paddy soil ecosystems included phosphatase, β-glucosidase, cellulase, and urease. These results provide novel insights into integrated fish in the paddy field as an efficient agricultural development strategy for enhancing soil microorganisms that increase soil fertility. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A general theory for competitive dynamics among many strains at the epidemiological level is required to understand polymorphisms in virulence, transmissibility, antibiotic resistance and other biological traits of infectious agents. Mathematical coinfection models have addressed specific systems, focusing on the criteria leading to stable coexistence or competitive exclusion, however, due to their complexity and nonlinearity, analytical solutions in coinfection models remain rare. Here we study a 2-strain Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) compartmental model with co-infection/co-colonization, incorporating five strain fitness dimensions under the same framework: variation in transmissibility, duration of carriage, pairwise susceptibilities to coinfection, coinfection duration, and transmission priority effects from mixed coinfection. Taking advantage of a singular perturbation approach, under the assumption of strain similarity, we expose how strain dynamics on a slow timescale are explicitly governed by a replicator equation which encapsulates all traits and their interplay. This allows to predict explicitly not only the final epidemiological outcome of a given 2-player competition, but moreover, their entire frequency dynamics as a direct function of their relative variation and of strain-transcending global parameters. Based on mutual invasion fitnesses, we analyze and report rigorous results on transition phenomena in the 2-strain system, strongly mediated via endemic coinfection prevalence. We show that coinfection is not always a promoter of coexistence; instead, its effect to favour or prevent polymorphism is non-monotonic and depends on the type and level of phenotypic differentiation between strains. This framework offers a deeper analytical understanding of 2-strain competitive games in coinfection, with theoretical and practical applications in epidemiology, ecology and evolution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mobile consumers are key vectors of cross-ecosystem nutrients, yet have experienced population declines which threaten their ability to fill this role. Despite their importance and vulnerability, there is little information on how consumer biodiversity, in addition to biomass, influences the magnitude of nutrient subsidies. Here, we show that both biomass and diversity of seabirds enhanced the provisioning of nutrients across tropical islands and coral reefs, but their relative influence varied across systems. Seabird biomass was particularly important for terrestrial and near-shore subsidies and enhancing fish biomass, while seabird diversity was associated with nutrient subsidies further offshore. The positive effects of diversity were likely driven by high functional complementarity among seabird species in traits related to nutrient storage and provisioning. However, introduced rats and non-native vegetation reduced seabird biomass and diversity, with rats having a stronger effect on biomass and vegetation having a stronger effect on diversity. Accordingly, the restoration of cross-ecosystem nutrient flows provided by seabirds will likely be most successful when both stressors are removed, thus protecting both high biomass and diversity. Recognizing the importance of mobile consumer diversity and biomass, and their underlying drivers, is a necessary step to conserving these species and the ecosystem functions they provide.  © },

	abstract = {Addressing genetic diversity and application of appropriate breeding strategies are imperative for Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea L.) improvement as a newly introduced legume in Malaysia. It has become a "miracle lucrative"legume for Asia and Africa because of its drought resilience, excellent nutritional profiles, and versatile uses. This crop's progress has been limited owing to a lack of extensive research, marginalization, inadequate knowledge, and a lack of accessible funds, among other concerns. The expansion of this crop is reliant on the assessment and selection of unique and reliable breeding lines in various circumstances. Consequently, the goal of this work is to determine genetic diversity and the relationship between yield-contributing components in 44 Bambara groundnut accessions sourced from the Genebank of Institute of Tropical Agriculture and Food Security (ITAFoS) at Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). Three replications were used in the experiment, which was done using a randomized complete block design (RCBD). The data were subjected to ANOVA, PCA, correlation, and heat map cluster analysis; also, genetic parameters and broad-sense heritability estimation were carried out on recorded phenotypic descriptors. All of the investigated variables had a significant variance (p≤0.05 or 0.01) according to the ANOVA results. Yield per hectare showed a positively strong to perfect significant correlation (0.75≤r≤1.00; p≤0.01) with the yield components viz. fresh pod weight, hundred seed weight, dry pod weight, and dry seed weight. Interestingly, these traits had heritability≥60% and genetic gain≥20%, which can be beneficial for direct selection to this crop improvement. The UPGMA clustering revealed five distinct clusters in which genotypes under cluster I, cluster II, and cluster IV produce a greater yield of 5.96%, 7.12%, and 15.05%, respectively, than the grand mean yield of 1927.01 kg/ha. The PCA biplot estimated that PC1 (32.9%) and PC2 (12.9%) would cover 45.8% of the total variance. We discovered 30 promising lines that provide yields per hectare more than 1.8 ton/ha and might be used as parental lines in future breeding operations aimed at improving the grain yield in tropical areas or comparable agroecological zones.  © 2022 Md Mahmudul Hasan Khan et al.},

	abstract = {L. monocytogenes is a widespread facultative intracellular pathogen. The range of natural hosts that supporting L. monocytogenes persistence in the environment has not been fully established yet. In this study, we were interested in the potential of L. monocytogenes to infect cells of bats, which are being increasingly recognized as a reservoir for microorganisms that are pathogenic to humans and domestic animals. A stable epithelial cell line was developed from the kidneys of Pipistrellus nathusii, a small bat widely distributed across Europe. The wild-type L. monocytogenes strain EGDe infected this cell line with an invasion efficiency of 0.0078 ± 0.0009%. Once it entered bat cells, L. monocytogenes doubled within about 70 minutes. When L. monocytogenes lacked either of the major invasion factors, InlA and InlB, invasion efficiency decreased by a factor of 10 and 25 respectively (p < 0.000001). The obtained results suggest that bat epithelial cells are susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection and that L. monocytogenes invasion of bat cells depends on the major invasion factors InlA and InlB. These results constitute the first report on in vitro studies of L. monocytogenes infection in bats. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is considered to mitigate the adverse effects of changing precipitation patterns. However, our understanding of how tree diversity at the local neighbourhood scale modulates the water use and leaf physiology of individual trees remains unclear. We made use of a large-scale tree diversity experiment in subtropical China to study eight tree species along an experimentally manipulated gradient of local neighbourhood tree species richness. Twig wood carbon isotope composition (δ 13 C wood) was used as an indicator for immediate leaf-level responses to water availability in relation to local neighbourhood conditions and a target tree's functional traits. Across species, a target tree's δ 13 C wood signatures decreased progressively with increasing neighbourhood species richness, with effects being strongest at high neighbourhood shading intensity. Moreover, the δ 13 C wood -shading relationship shifted from positive (thin-leaved species) or neutral (thick-leaved species) in conspecific to negative in heterospecific neighbourhoods, most likely owing to a lower interspecific competition for water and microclimate amelioration. This suggests that promoting tree species richness at the local neighbourhood scale may improve a tree's local water supply with potential effects for an optimized water-use efficiency of tree communities during drought. This assumption, however, requires validation by further studies that focus on mechanisms that regulate the water availability in mixtures. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Toxicity is often singled out as the sole trait to which consumers can adapt, even though cyanobacteria are not necessarily toxic and the lack of nutritionally critical sterols in cyanobacteria is known to impair consumers. We studied the relative significance of toxicity and dietary sterol deficiency in driving the evolution of grazer resistance to cyanobacteria in a large lake with a well-documented history of eutrophication and oligotrophication. Resurrecting decades-old Daphnia genotypes from the sediment allowed us to show that the evolution and subsequent loss of grazer resistance to cyanobacteria involved an adaptation to changes in both toxicity and dietary sterol availability. The adaptation of Daphnia to changes in cyanobacteria abundance revealed a sterol-mediated gleaner-opportunist trade-off. Genotypes from peak-eutrophic periods showed a higher affinity for dietary sterols at the cost of a lower maximum growth rate, whereas genotypes from more oligotrophic periods showed a lower affinity for dietary sterols in favour of a higher maximum growth rate. Our data corroborate the significance of sterols as limiting nutrients in aquatic food webs and highlight the applicability of the gleaner-opportunist trade-off for reconstructing eco-evolutionary processes.  © },

	abstract = {Skin infections have been associated with Acanthamoeba, nevertheless the events during skin invasion and UV-B light effects on it are unknown. The early morphological events of Acanthamoeba castellanii skin invasion are shown in SKH-1 mice that were chronically UV-B light irradiated. Mice that developed skin lesions (group 1) were topical and intradermally inoculated with A. castellanii trophozoites and sacrificed 48 h or 18 days later. Mice that showed no skin lesions (group 2) were intradermally inoculated and sacrificed 24, 48 or 72 h later. Mice ventral areas were considered controls with and without trophozoites intradermally inoculated. Skin samples were processed by histological and immunohistochemistry techniques. In group 1, trophozoites were immunolocalized in dermal areas, hair cysts, sebaceous glands, and blood vessels, and collagen degradation was observed. One of these mice shown trophozoites in the spleen, liver, and brain. In group 2, few trophozoites nearby collagenolytic activity zones were observed. In control samples, nor histological damage and no trophozoites were observed. Adherence and collagenolytic activity by A. castellanii were corroborated in vitro. We can infer that UV-B light irradiated skin could favor A. castellanii invasiveness causing damage in sites as far away as the brain, confirming the invasive capacity and pathogenic potential of these amphizoic amoebae. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {In this study, we describe the legacy effects of a soil sulfur amendment experiment performed 6 years prior and the resulting alterations to the rhizosphere communities of fir trees on a Christmas tree plantation. The pH of bulk soil was ~1.4 pH units lower than that of untreated soils and was associated with reduced Ca, Mg, and organic matter contents. Similarly, root chemistry differed due to the treatment, with roots in sulfur-amended soils showing significantly higher Al, Mn, and Zn contents and reduced levels of B and Ca. 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequencing was pursued to characterize the bacterial/archaeal and eukaryotic communities in the rhizosphere soils. Thetreatment induced dramatic and significant changes in the microbial populations, with thousands of 16S rRNA gene sequence variants and hundreds of 18S rRNA gene variants being significantly different in relative abundances between the treatments. Additionally, co-occurrence networks showed that bacterial and eukaryotic interactions, network topology, and hub taxa were significantly different when constructed from the control and treated soil 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon libraries. Metagenome sequencing identified several genes related to transport proteins that differentiated the functional potentials of the communities between treatments, pointing to physiological adaptations in the microbial communities for living at altered pH. These data show that a legacy of soil acidification increased the heterogeneity of the soil communities as well as decreasing taxon connections, pointing to a state of ecosystem instability that has potentially persisted for 6 years. IMPORTANCE We used sulfur incorporation to investigate the legacy effects of lowered soil pH on the bacterial and eukaryotic populations in the rhizosphere of Christmas trees. Acidification of the soils drove alterations of fir tree root chemistry and large shifts in the taxonomic and functional compositions of the communities. These data demonstrate that soil pH influences are manifest across all organisms inhabiting the soil, from the host plant to the microorganisms inhabiting the rhizosphere soils. Thus, this study highlights the long-lasting influence of altering soil pH on soil and plant health as well as the status of the microbiome. © 2021. Steven et al.

	abstract = {Sorghum is an important staple food crop in drought prone areas of Sub-Saharan Africa, which is characterized by erratic rainfall with poor distribution. Sorghum is a drought-tolerant crop by nature with reasonable yield compared to other cereal crops, but such abiotic stress adversely affects the productivity. Some sorghum varieties maintain green functional leaves under post-anthesis drought stress referred to as stay-green, which makes it an important crop for food and nutritional security. Notwithstanding, it is difficult to maintain consistency of tolerance over time due to climate change, which is caused by human activities. Drought in sorghum is addressed by several approaches, for instance, breeding drought-tolerant sorghum using conventional and molecular technologies. The challenge with conventional methods is that they depend on phenotyping stay-green, which is complex in sorghum, as it is constituted by multiple genes and environmental effects. Marker assisted selection, which involves the use of DNA molecular markers to map QTL associated with stay-green, has been useful to supplement stay-green improvement in sorghum. It involves QTL mapping associated with the stay-green trait for introgression into the senescent sorghum varieties through marker-assisted backcrossing by comparing with phenotypic field data. Therefore, this review discusses mechanisms of drought tolerance in sorghum focusing on physiological, morphological, and biochemical traits. In addition, the review discusses the application of marker-assisted selection techniques, including marker-assisted backcrossing, QTL mapping, and QTL pyramiding for addressing post-flowering drought in sorghum. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Embryo survival in birds depends on a controlled transfer of water vapour and respiratory gases through the eggshell, and this exchange is critically sensitive to the surrounding physical environment. As birds breed in most terrestrial habitats worldwide, we proposed that variation in eggshell conductance has evolved to optimize embryonic development under different breeding conditions. This is the first study to take a broad-scale macro-ecological view of avian eggshell conductance, encompassing all key avian taxonomic groups, to assess how life history and climate influence the evolution of this trait. Using whole eggs spanning a wide phylogenetic diversity of birds, we determine that body mass, temperature seasonality and whether both parents attend the nest are the main determinants of eggshell conductance. Birds breeding at high latitudes, where seasonal temperature fluctuations are greatest, will benefit from lower eggshell conductance to combat temporary periods of suspended embryo growth and prevent dehydration during prolonged incubation. The nest microclimate is more consistent in species where parents take turns incubating their clutch, resulting in lower eggshell conductance. This study highlights the remarkable functional qualities of eggshells and their importance for embryo survival in extreme climates.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest food-producing sector in the world, accounting for one-third of global food production. As is the case with all intensive farming systems, increase in infectious diseases has adversely impacted the growth of marine fish farming worldwide. Viral diseases cause high economic losses in marine aquaculture. We provide an overview of the major challenges limiting the control and prevention of viral diseases in marine fish farming, as well as highlight potential solutions. The major challenges include increase in the number of emerging viral diseases, wild reservoirs, migratory species, anthropogenic activities, limitations in diagnostic tools and expertise, transportation of virus contaminated ballast water, and international trade. The proposed solutions to these problems include developing biosecurity policies at global and national levels, implementation of biosecurity measures, vaccine development, use of antiviral drugs and probiotics to combat viral infections, selective breeding of disease-resistant fish, use of improved diagnostic tools, disease surveillance, as well as promoting the use of good husbandry and management practices. A multifaceted approach combining several control strategies would provide more effective long-lasting solutions to reduction in viral infections in marine aquaculture than using a single disease control approach like vaccination alone. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {We derive how directional and disruptive selection operate on scalar traits in a heterogeneous group-structured population for a general class of models. In particular, we assume that each group in the population can be in one of a finite number of states, where states can affect group size and/or other environmental variables, at a given time. Using up to second-order perturbation expansions of the invasion fitness of a mutant allele, we derive expressions for the directional and disruptive selection coefficients, which are sufficient to classify the singular strategies of adaptive dynamics. These expressions include first- and second-order perturbations of individual fitness (expected number of settled offspring produced by an individual, possibly including self through survival); the first-order perturbation of the stationary distribution of mutants (derived here explicitly for the first time); the first-order perturbation of pairwise relatedness; and reproductive values, pairwise and three-way relatedness, and stationary distribution of mutants, each evaluated under neutrality. We introduce the concept of individual k-fitness (defined as the expected number of settled offspring of an individual for which k-1 randomly chosen neighbors are lineage members) and show its usefulness for calculating relatedness and its perturbation. We then demonstrate that the directional and disruptive selection coefficients can be expressed in terms individual k-fitnesses with k=1,2,3 only. This representation has two important benefits. First, it allows for a significant reduction in the dimensions of the system of equations describing the mutant dynamics that needs to be solved to evaluate explicitly the two selection coefficients. Second, it leads to a biologically meaningful interpretation of their components. As an application of our methodology, we analyze directional and disruptive selection in a lottery model with either hard or soft selection and show that many previous results about selection in group-structured populations can be reproduced as special cases of our model. © 2020 The Authors},

In the Barents Sea, a hotspot for global warming, marine fish from boreal regions have been increasingly found in the more exclusive Arctic region. Here, we show that this shift in species distribution is increasing species richness and evenness, and even more so, the functional diversity of the Arctic. Higher diversity is often interpreted as being positive for ecosystem health and is a target for conservation. However, the increasing trend observed here may be transitory as the traits involved threaten Arctic species via predation and competition. If the pressure from global warming continues to rise, the ensuing loss of Arctic species will result in a reduction in functional diversity. © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Agriculture-based ecosystem remains the backbone of the economy of many developing and developed countries across the world. However, massive urbanization and rapid industrialization events not only affect natural resources but also critically affect the agricultural productivity. Though a progressive development in the farming technologies has achieved in recent times, it is important to understand structure and dynamics of soil microbiota. The soil microbiota (composed of bacteria, fungi, algae, and protozoans) play a pivotal role in maintaining the soil ecosystem and thus imperatively support the agricultural sustainability. The traditional practices of isolation and identification of soil microbial communities are being used unprecedentedly to improve agricultural productivity. However, a recent advancement in the molecular tools has given a new paradigm to understand ecological connectivity between the plant and the soil microbial communities. The high throughput next generation OMICS technologies exploiting the next generation genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics have gained considerable attention owing to their applicability not only in improving the agricultural productivity but also in improving the food security. It is also highly important to have coordination between the OMICS-based technologies with the advanced computational biology based tools to improve the agricultural sustainability through the improvement of genotypic and phenotypic traits. This chapter will provide comprehensive knowledge on the current understanding of soil microbiotas though the lenses of OMICS-based tools to improve agricultural productivity and sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

It has been hypothesized that social evolution can influence the strength of negative selection via two mechanisms. First, division of labour can influence the efficiency of negative selection in a caste-specific manner; indirect negative selection on worker traits is theoretically expected to be weaker than direct selection on queen traits. Second, increasing social complexity is expected to lead to relaxed negative selection because of its influence on effective population size. We tested these two hypotheses by estimating the strength of negative selection in honeybees, bumblebees, paper wasps, fire ants and six other insects that span the range of social complexity. We found no consistent evidence that negative selection was significantly stronger on queen-biased genes relative to worker-biased genes. However, we found strong evidence that increased social complexity reduced the efficiency of negative selection. Our study clearly illustrates how changes in behaviour can influence patterns of genome evolution by modulating the strength of natural selection. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Sustainable agriculture is a promising concept to achieve food security for the ever-increasing world population under the climate change scenario. Microbial communities are highly responsive to environmental cues, and their structure, composition, and functions can be altered in response to changing conditions. These communities play a crucial role in integrated nutrient management (INM) as they provide an economical renewable source of plant nutrients that supplements chemical fertilizers. Currently, microbial bioinoculants are widely used as microbial biofertilizers, biopesticides, and biocontrol agents in the developing countries like India. Several microorganisms have been identified and commercialized for applications as biofertilizers for crop plants. Microbial bioinoculants may possess certain limitations, which reduces the activities/effectiveness of bioinoculants. Recent developments in the genetic engineering tools made it possible to alter/modify one or more number of genes of a microorganism which leads to increase in production of certain metabolites, survival, and adeptness in soil. Genetic engineering and genome-editing approaches are being used for strain improvement via genetically engineered microbial systems (GEMSs) and genetically modified microorganisms (GMOs) for owning known and advanced functional characteristics. The genetically modified beneficial traits are applied for improving plant nutrition, soil microbial health, and protection of plants for biotic and abiotic stresses toward increasing the crop productivity. This chapter deals with basics on need of genetic modifications and traits manipulated in the microbes and their potential applications to promote sustainable agriculture and food security. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

However, no systematic characterization of AGO genes in wheat has been reported to date. In this study, a total number of 69 TaAGO genes in the hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring) genome, divided into 10 subfamilies, were identified. Compared to all wheat genes, TaAGOs showed a significantly lower evolutionary rate, which is consistent with their high conservation in eukaryotes. However, the homoeolog retention was remarkably higher than the average, implying the nonredundant biological importance of TaAGO genes in bread wheat. Further homoeologous gene expression bias analyses revealed that TaAGOs may have undergone neofunctionalization after polyploidization and duplication through the divergent expression of homoeologous gene copies, to provide new opportunities for the generation of adaptive traits. Moreover, quantitative real-Time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses indicated that TaAGO gene expression was involved in response to heat, drought, and salt stresses. Our results would provide a theoretical basis for future studies on the biological functions of TaAGO genes in wheat and other gramineous species.  © 2021 Yan-Feng Liu et al.},

	abstract = {Many species face extinction risks owing to climate change, and there is an urgent need to identify which species' populations will be most vulnerable. Plasticity in heat tolerance, which includes acclimation or hardening, occurs when prior exposure to a warmer temperature changes an organism's upper thermal limit. The capacity for thermal acclimation could provide protection against warming, but prior work has found few generalizable patterns to explain variation in this trait. Here, we report the results of, to our knowledge, the first meta-analysis to examine within-species variation in thermal plasticity, using results from 20 studies (19 species) that quantified thermal acclimation capacities across 78 populations. We used meta-regression to evaluate two leading hypotheses. The climate variability hypothesis predicts that populations from more thermally variable habitats will have greater plasticity, while the trade-off hypothesis predicts that populations with the lowest heat tolerance will have the greatest plasticity. Our analysis indicates strong support for the trade-off hypothesis because populations with greater thermal tolerance had reduced plasticity. These results advance our understanding of variation in populations' susceptibility to climate change and imply that populations with the highest thermal tolerance may have limited phenotypic plasticity to adjust to ongoing climate warming. © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Laboratory-derived temperature dependencies of life-history traits are increasingly being used to make mechanistic predictions for how climatic warming will affect vector-borne disease dynamics, partially by affecting abundance dynamics of the vector population. These temperature-trait relationships are typically estimated from juvenile populations reared on optimal resource supply, even though natural populations of vectors are expected to experience variation in resource supply, including intermittent resource limitation. Using laboratory experiments on the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a principal arbovirus vector, combined with stage-structured population modelling, we show that low-resource supply in the juvenile life stages significantly depresses the vector's maximal population growth rate across the entire temperature range (22-32°C) and causes it to peak at a lower temperature than at high-resource supply. This effect is primarily driven by an increase in juvenile mortality and development time, combined with a decrease in adult size with temperature at low-resource supply. Our study suggests that most projections of temperature-dependent vector abundance and disease transmission are likely to be biased because they are based on traits measured under optimal resource supply. Our results provide compelling evidence for future studies to consider resource supply when predicting the effects of climate and habitat change on vector-borne disease transmission, disease vectors and other arthropods. © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Family Flaviviridae, which encompasses several small dreadful viruses under its canopy has been a big challenge for human health globally.. With four genera and 89 species the family has drawn attention due to its genus Flavivirus known for its significant pathogenic members such as yellow fever virus (YFV), Dengue Virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis Virus (JEV), West Nile Virus (WNV), Zika virus (ZIKV), tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV).These viruses are lipid enveloped and have small (+) ssRNA genome of approximately 11 Kb with a single Open Reading Frame (ORF), coding for three structural and seven non-structural proteins. The members of this genus exhibit receptor mediated endocytosis for accessing the host cells and upon successful entry, they undergo replication using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a trait possessed by all riboviruses. Their high mutation rate leads to significant genetic diversity within the species; therefore designing specific antiviral drug(s) remains a challenge. Complexity also arises due to the spread of these viruses using vectors in their transmission cycles; arthropods being on the top notch among the vectors. Majority of them exploit mosquitos as their carriers and humans as their hosts, therefore global warming and human travel across the continents have aggravated their spread to other parts of the world, shifting their status from epidemic to pandemic. Although effective vaccine development is the need of the hour for the control of this group of viruses, but vector control seems to be the only plausible solution in current scenario so that their human transmissions can be controlled. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

Rates of evolution calculated over longer timescales tend to fall below the expected under genetic drift, suggesting that directional selection signals are erased at longer timescales. Here, we investigated the rates of morphological evolution of the skull in a fossil lineage that underwent extreme morphological modification, the glyptodonts. Contrary to what was expected, we show here that directional selection was the primary process during the evolution of glyptodonts. Furthermore, the reconstruction of selection patterns shows that traits selected to generate a glyptodont morphology are markedly different from those operating on extant armadillos. Changes in both direction and magnitude of selection are probably tied to glyptodonts' invasion of a specialist-herbivore adaptive zone. These results suggest that directional selection might have played a more critical role in the evolution of extreme morphologies than previously imagined.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Body size in animals commonly shows geographic and temporal variations that may depend upon several environmental drivers, including climatic conditions, productivity, geography and species interactions. The topic of body size trends across time has gained momentum in recent years since this has been proposed as a third universal response to climate change along with changes in distribution and phenology. However, disentangling the genuine effects of climate change from those of other environmental factors is often far from trivial. In this study, we tested a set of hypotheses concerning body size variation across time and space in Italian populations of a rhinolophid bat, the lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolophus hipposideros. We examined forearm length (FAL) and cranial linear traits in a unique historical collection of this species covering years from 1869 to 2016, representing, to the best of our knowledge, the longest time series ever considered in a morphological assessment of a bat species. No temporal changes occurred, rejecting the hypotheses that body size varied in response to climate change or urbanization (light pollution). We found that FAL increased with latitude following a Bergmann’s rule trend, whereas the width of upper incisors, likely a diet-related trait, showed an opposite pattern which awaits explanation. We also confirmed that FAL is sexually dimorphic in this species and ruled out that insularity has any detectable effect on the linear traits we considered. This suggests that positive responses of body size to latitude do not mean per se that concurring temporal responses to climate change are also expected. Further investigations should explore the occurrence of these patterns over larger spatial scales and more species in order to detect the existence of general patterns across time and space. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The role of light in structuring the ecological niche remains a frontier in understanding how vertebrate communities assemble and respond to global change. For birds, eyes represent the primary external anatomical structure specifically evolved to interpret light, yet eye morphology remains understudied compared to movement and dietary traits. Here, I use Stanley Ritland's unpublished measurements of transverse eye diameter from preserved specimens to explore the ecological and phylogenetic drivers of eye morphology for a third of terrestrial avian diversity (N = 2777 species). Species with larger eyes specialized in darker understory and forested habitats, foraging manoeuvres and prey items requiring long-distance optical resolution and were more likely to occur in tropical latitudes. When compared to dietary and movement traits, eye size was a top predictor for habitat, foraging manoeuvre, diet and latitude, adding 8-28% more explanatory power. Eye size was phylogenetically conserved (λ = 0.90), with phylogeny explaining 61% of eye size variation. I suggest that light has contributed to the evolution and assembly of global vertebrate communities and that eye size provides a useful predictor to assess community response to global change.  © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Researchers worldwide are repeatedly warning us against future zoonotic diseases resulting from humankind’s insurgence into natural ecosystems. The same zoonotic pathogens that cause severe infections in a human host frequently fail to produce any disease outcome in their natural hosts. What precise features of the immune system enable natural reservoirs to carry these pathogens so efficiently? To understand these effects, we highlight the importance of tracing the evolutionary basis of pathogen tolerance in reservoir hosts, while drawing implications from their diverse physiological and life-history traits, and ecological contexts of host-pathogen interactions. Long-term co-evolution might allow reservoir hosts to modulate immunity and evolve tolerance to zoonotic pathogens, increasing their circulation and infectious period. Such processes can also create a genetically diverse pathogen pool by allowing more mutations and genetic exchanges between circulating strains, thereby harboring rare alive-on-arrival variants with extended infectivity to new hosts (i.e., spillover). Finally, we end by underscoring the indispensability of a large multidis-ciplinary empirical framework to explore the proposed link between evolved tolerance, pathogen prevalence, and spillover in the wild. ‍© Seal et al.},

	abstract = {Beneficial microorganisms shape the evolutionary trajectories of their hosts, facilitating or constraining the colonization of new ecological niches. One convincing example entails the responses of insect-microbe associations to rising temperatures. Indeed, insect resilience to stressful high temperatures depends on the genetic identity of the obligate symbiont and the presence of heat-protective facultative symbionts. As extensively studied organisms, aphids and their endosymbiotic bacteria represent valuable models to address eco-evolutionary questions about the thermal ecology of insect-microbe partnerships, with broad relevance to various biological systems and insect models. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the context-dependent impacts of symbionts on host phenotype in benign or stressful heat conditions, across fitness traits, types of heat stress and symbiont species. We found that warming lowered the benefits (resistance to parasitoids) and costs (development, fecundity) of infection by facultative symbionts, which was overall mostly beneficial to the hosts under short-term heat stress (heat shock) rather than extended warming. Heat-tolerant genotypes of the obligate symbiont Buchnera aphidicola and some facultative symbionts (Rickettsia sp., Serratia symbiotica) improved or maintained aphid fitness under heat stress. We discuss the implications of these findings for the general understanding of the cost-benefit balance of insect-microbe associations across multiple traits and their eco-evolutionary dynamics faced with climate change.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

We screened 1509 bees from 16 genera in sunflower fields and in non-crop flowering habitat across 200 km 2 of the California Central Valley. We found that mass-flowering crops increase bee abundance. Wild bee abundance was subsequently associated with higher parasite presence, but only in sites with a low abundance of non-crop flowers. Bee traits related to higher dispersal ability (body size) and diet breadth (pollen lecty) were also positively related to parasite presence. Our results highlight the importance of non-crop flowering habitat for supporting bee communities. We suggest monoculture alone cannot support healthy bees. © 2021 The Author(s).},

Here, we report a widespread change in the functional diversity of fisheries catches from the large marine ecosystems (LMEs) of the world over the past 65 years (1950 to 2014). The spatial and temporal trends of functional diversity exploited from the LMEs were calculated using global reconstructed marine fisheries catch data provided by the Sea Around Us initiative (including subsistence, artisanal, recreational, industrial fisheries, and discards) and functional trait data available in FishBase. Our analyses uncovered a substantial increase in the functional richness of both ray-finned fishes (80% of LMEs) and cartilaginous species (sharks and rays) (75% of LMESs), in line with an increase in the taxonomic richness, extracted from these ecosystems. The functional evenness and functional divergence of these catches have also altered substantially over the time span of this study, with considerable geographic variation in the patterns detected. These trends show that global fisheries are increasingly targeting species that play diverse roles within the marine ecosystem and underline the importance of incorporating functional diversity in ecosystem management. © 2020 The Author(s).},

Yet, how functionally distinct species have responded to recent climate change and human exploitation has been widely overlooked. Here, using ecological traits and long-term fish data in the North Sea, we identified functionally distinct and functionally common species, and evaluated their spatial and temporal dynamics in relation to environmental variables and fishing pressure. Functionally distinct species were characterized by late sexual maturity, few, large offspring, and high parental care, many being sharks and skates that play critical roles in structuring food webs. Both functionally distinct and functionally common species increased in abundance as ocean temperatures warmed and fishing pressure decreased over the last three decades; however, functionally distinct species increased throughout the North Sea, but primarily in southern North Sea where fishing was historically most intense, indicating a rebound following fleet decommissioning and reduced harvesting. Yet, some of the most functionally distinct species are currently listed as threatened by the IUCN and considered highly vulnerable to fishing pressure. Alarmingly these species have not rebounded.

Whether certain life-history strategies are more conducive to surviving changing climates is unknown, but theory predicts that strategies prioritizing maintenance and survival over current reproduction should be better able to withstand such change. We tested this hypothesis in a meta-population of garter snakes having naturally occurring variation in life-history strategies. We tested whether slow pace-of-life (POL) animals, that prioritize survival over reproduction, are more resilient than fast POL animals as measured by several physiological biomarkers. From 2006 to 2019, which included two multi-year droughts, baseline and stress-induced reactivity of plasma corticosterone and glucose varied annually with directionalities consistent with life-history theory. Slow POL animals exhibited higher baseline corticosterone and lower baseline glucose, relative to fast POL animals. These patterns were also observed in stress-induced measures; thus, reactivity was equivalent between ecotypes. However, in drought years, measures of corticosterone did not differ between different life histories. Immune cell distribution showed annual variation independent of drought or life history. These persistent physiological patterns form a backdrop to several extirpations of fast POL populations, suggesting a limited physiological toolkit to surviving periods of extreme drought.  © 2022 The Author(s).},

The complex relationships between these counteracting processes – community reassembly and spatial self-organization – have hardly been studied. Using a spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities and a trait-based approach, we study the response of such communities to imposed water stress of increasing degrees. We first show that spatial patterning acts to reverse shifts from fast-growing species to stress-tolerant species, as well as to reverse functional-diversity loss. We then show that spatial re-patterning buffers the impact of further stress on community structure. Finally, we identify multistability ranges of uniform and patterned community states and use them to propose forms of non-uniform ecosystem management that integrate the need for provisioning ecosystem services with the need to preserve community structure. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

Patterns of ancestry within the genomes of invasive plants also reveal post-colonization hybridization and introgression between S. pimpinellifolium and the closely related Galapagos endemic Solanum cheesmaniae. Of admixed invasive individuals, those that carry endemic alleles at one of two different carotenoid biosynthesis loci also have orange fruits— characteristic of the endemic species—instead of typical red S. pimpinellifolium fruits. We infer that introgression of two independent fruit color loci explains this observed trait convergence, suggesting that selection has favored repeated transitions of red to orange fruits on the Galapagos. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Species invasions and range shifts can lead to novel host-parasite communities, but we lack general rules on which new associations are likely to form. While many studies examine parasite sharing among host species, the directionality of transmission is typically overlooked, impeding our ability to derive principles of parasite acquisition. Consequently, we analysed parasite records from the non-native ranges of 11 carnivore and ungulate species. Using boosted regression trees, we modelled parasite acquisition within each zoogeographic realm of a focal host's non-native range, using a suite of predictors characterizing the parasites themselves and the host community in which they live. We found that higher parasite prevalence among established hosts increases the likelihood of acquisition, particularly for generalist parasites. Non-native host species are also more likely to acquire parasites from established host species to which they are closely related; however, the acquisition of several parasite groups is biased to phylogenetically specialist parasites, indicating potential costs of parasite generalism. Statistical models incorporating these features provide an accurate prediction of parasite acquisition, indicating that measurable host and parasite traits can be used to estimate the likelihood of new host-parasite associations forming. This work provides general rules to help anticipate novel host-parasite associations created by climate change and other anthropogenic influences.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Evolutionary changes in the anatomy and physiology of the female reproductive system underlie the origins and diversification of pregnancy in Eutherian (“Placental”) mammals. This developmental and evolutionary history constrains normal physiological functions and biases the ways in which dysfunction contributes to reproductive trait diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Here, we show that gene expression changes in the human endometrium during pregnancy are associated with the evolution of human-specific traits and pathologies of pregnancy. We found that hundreds of genes gained or lost endometrial expression in the human lineage. Among these are genes that may contribute to human-specific maternal-fetal communication (HTR2B) and maternal-fetal immunotolerance (PDCD1LG2) systems, as well as vascular remodeling and deep placental invasion (CORIN). These data suggest that explicit evolutionary studies of anatomical systems complement traditional methods for characterizing the genetic architecture of disease. We also anticipate our results will advance the emerging synthesis of evolution and medicine (“evolutionary medicine”) and be a starting point for more sophisticated studies of the maternal-fetal interface. Furthermore, the gene expression changes we identified may contribute to the development of diagnostics and interventions for adverse pregnancy outcomes. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Knowledge of multi-stressor interactions and the potential for tradeoffs among tolerance traits is essential for developing intervention strategies for the conservation and restoration of reef ecosystems in a changing climate. Thermal extremes and acidification are two major co-occurring stresses predicted to limit the recovery of vital Caribbean reef-building corals. Here, we conducted an aquarium-based experiment to quantify the effects of increased water temperatures and pCO 2 individually and in concert on 12 genotypes of the endangered branching coral Acropora cervicornis, currently being reared and outplanted for large-scale coral restoration. Quantification of 12 host, symbiont and holobiont traits throughout the two-month-long experiment showed several synergistic negative effects, where the combined stress treatment often caused a greater reduction in physiological function than the individual stressors alone. However, we found significant genetic variation for most traits and positive trait correlations among treatments indicating an apparent lack of tradeoffs, suggesting that adaptive evolution will not be constrained. Our results suggest that it may be possible to incorporate climate-resistant coral genotypes into restoration and selective breeding programmes, potentially accelerating adaptation. © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {A variety of factors can affect the biodiversity of tropical mammal communities, but their relative importance and directionality remain uncertain. Previous global investigations of mammal functional diversity have relied on range maps instead of observational data to determine community composition. We test the effects of species pools, habitat heterogeneity, primary productivity and human disturbance on the functional diversity (dispersion and richness) of mammal communities using the largest standardized tropical forest camera trap monitoring system, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network. We use occupancy values derived from the camera trap data to calculate occupancy-weighted functional diversity and use Bayesian generalized linear regression to determine the effects of multiple predictors. Mammal community functional dispersion increased with primary productivity, while functional richness decreased with human-induced local extinctions and was significantly lower in Madagascar than other tropical regions. The significant positive relationship between functional dispersion and productivity was evident only when functional dispersion was weighted by species' occupancies. Thus, observational data from standardized monitoring can reveal the drivers of mammal communities in ways that are not readily apparent from range map-based studies. The positive association between occupancy-weighted functional dispersion of tropical forest mammal communities and primary productivity suggests that unique functional traits may be more beneficial in more productive ecosystems and may allow species to persist at higher abundances. © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Models predicting disease transmission are vital tools for long-term planning of malaria reduction efforts, particularly for mitigating impacts of climate change. We compared temperature-dependent malaria transmission models when mosquito life-history traits were estimated from a truncated portion of the lifespan (a common practice) versus traits measured across the full lifespan. We conducted an experiment on adult female Anopheles stephensi, the Asian urban malaria mosquito, to generate daily per capita values for mortality, egg production and biting rate at six constant temperatures. Both temperature and age significantly affected trait values. Further, we found quantitative and qualitative differences between temperature-trait relationships estimated from truncated data versus observed lifetime values. Incorporating these temperature-trait relationships into an expression governing the thermal suitability of transmission, relative R 0 (T), resulted in minor differences in the breadth of suitable temperatures for Plasmodium falciparum transmission between the two models constructed from only An. stephensi trait data. However, we found a substantial increase in thermal niche breadth compared with a previously published model consisting of trait data from multiple Anopheles mosquito species. Overall, this work highlights the importance of considering how mosquito trait values vary with mosquito age and mosquito species when generating temperature-based suitability predictions of transmission.  © 2020 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are experiencing declines due to climate change and local human impacts. While at a local scale these impacts induce biodiversity loss and shifts in community structure, previous biogeographical analyses recorded consistent taxonomic structure of fish communities across global coral reefs. This suggests that regional communities represent a random subset of the global species and traits pool, whatever their species richness. Using distributional data on 3586 fish species and latest advances in species distribution models, we show marked gradients in the prevalence of size classes and diet categories across the biodiversity gradient. This divergence in trait structure is best explained by reef isolation during past unfavourable climatic conditions, with large and piscivore fishes better represented in isolated areas. These results suggest the risk of a global community re-organization if the ongoing climate-induced reef fragmentation is not halted.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The temperature-dependence of many important mosquito-borne diseases has never been quantified. These relationships are critical for understanding current distributions and predicting future shifts from climate change. We used trait-based models to characterize temperature-dependent transmission of 10 vector–pathogen pairs of mosquitoes (Culex pipiens, Cx. quinquefascsiatus, Cx. tarsalis, and others) and viruses (West Nile, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Sindbis, and Rift Valley Fever viruses), most with substantial transmission in temperate regions. Transmission is optimized at intermediate temperatures (23–26˚ C) and often has wider thermal breadths (due to cooler lower thermal limits) compared to pathogens with predominately tropical distributions (in previous studies). The incidence of human West Nile virus cases across US counties responded unimodally to average summer temperature and peaked at 24˚C, matching model-predicted optima (24–25˚C). Climate warming will likely shift transmission of these diseases, increasing it in cooler locations while decreasing it in warmer locations. © Shocket et al.},

	abstract = {Most traits expressed by organisms, such as gene expression profiles, developmental trajectories, behavioural sequences and reaction norms are function-valued traits (colloquially “phenotypically plastic traits”), since they vary across an individual's age and in response to various internal and/or external factors (state variables). Furthermore, most organisms live in populations subject to limited genetic mixing and are thus likely to interact with their relatives. We here formalise selection on genetically determined function-valued traits of individuals interacting in a group-structured population, by deriving the marginal version of Hamilton's rule for function-valued traits. This rule simultaneously gives a condition for the invasion of an initially rare mutant function-valued trait and its ultimate fixation in the population (invasion thus implies substitution). Hamilton's rule thus underlies the gradual evolution of function-valued traits and gives rise to necessary first-order conditions for their uninvadability (evolutionary stability). We develop a novel analysis using optimal control theory and differential game theory, to simultaneously characterise and compare the first-order conditions of (i) open-loop traits – functions of time (or age) only, and (ii) closed-loop (state-feedback) traits – functions of both time and state variables. We show that closed-loop traits can be represented as the simpler open-loop traits when individuals do not interact or when they interact with clonal relatives. Our analysis delineates the role of state-dependence and interdependence between individuals for trait evolution, which has implications to both life-history theory and social evolution. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The mountains of southwest China (MSWC) is a biodiversity hotspot with highly complex and unusual terrain. However, with the majority of studies focusing on the biogeographic consequences of massive mountain building, the Quaternary legacy of biodiversity for the MSWC has long been overlooked. Here, we took a statistical comparative phylogeography approach to examine factors that shaped community-wide diversification. With data from 30 vertebrate species, the results reveal spatially concordant genetic structure, and temporally clustered co-divergence events associated with river barriers during severe glacial cycles. This indicates the importance of riverine barriers in the phylogeographic history of the MSWC vertebrate community. We conclude that the repeated glacial cycles are associated with co-divergences that are themselves structured by the heterogeneity of the montane landscape of the MSWC. This orderly process of diversification has profound implications for conservation by highlighting the relative independence of different geographical areas in which some, but not all species in communities have responded similarly to climate change and calls for further comparative phylogeographic investigations to reveal the connection between biological traits and divergence pulses in this biodiversity hotspot.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars (NTS) are generally associated with gastroenteritis; however, the very young and elderly, as well as individuals with compromised immunity, are at risk of developing disseminated infection that can manifest as bacteremia or focal infections at systemic sites. Disseminated NTS infections can be fatal and are responsible for over 600 000 deaths annually. Most of these deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa, where multidrug-resistant NTS clones are currently circulating in a population with a high proportion of individuals that are susceptible to disseminated disease. This review considers how genome degradation observed in African NTS isolates has resulted in phenotypic differences in traits related to environmental persistence and host–pathogen interactions. Further, it discusses host mechanisms promoting susceptibility to invasive infection with NTS in individuals with immunocompromising conditions. We conclude that mechanistic knowledge of how risk factors compromise immunity to disseminated NTS infection will be important for the design of interventions to protect against systemic disease. © FEMS 2016.

	abstract = {In the course of global climate change, central Europe is experiencing more frequent and prolonged periods of drought. The drought years 2018 and 2019 affected European beeches (Fagus sylvatica L.) differently: even in the same stand, drought damaged trees neighboured healthy trees, suggesting that the genotype rather than the environment was responsible for this conspicuous pattern. We used this natural experiment to study the genomic basis of drought resistance with Pool-GWAS. Contrasting the extreme phenotypes identified 106 significantly associated SNPs throughout the genome. Most annotated genes with associated SNPs (>70%) were previously implicated in the drought reaction of plants. Non-synonymous substitutions led either to a functional amino acid exchange or premature termination. A SNP-assay with 70 loci allowed predicting drought phenotype in 98.6% of a validation sample of 92 trees. Drought resistance in European beech is a moderately polygenic trait that should respond well to natural selection, selective management, and breeding. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {The objective of changing the simple exploitation of fish stocks to highly efficient fish farms in lakes and reservoirs is to improve the productivity of inland freshwater fish. The small- and medium-sized lakes can be used to increase the production of farmed fish with lake management. Therefore, this study proposed to investigate the production and economic efficiency of carp in lake commercial fish farms. In this investigation, the results of carp farming experiments in fish farms in small lake commercial fish farms (LCFF) are evaluated using advanced methods and techniques. The research was carried out based on the Voroshilovsky reservoir, which operated in the LCFF mode. The farm had hatchery and carp fry ponds for expanding fingerlings based on the "Scientific and production center of fishery" LLP from 2019 to 2020. This study was performed on different types of common carp and herbivorous fish (grass and silver carp), and sexual products were collected in fried ponds and the Voroshilovsky reservoir. The absolute growth gain of common carp, silver carp, and grass carp were 301.00, 300.40, and 577.00 grams, respectively, and their mean daily weight gain values were 2.50, 2.50, and 4.80 grams. Common carp recorded the highest level of planned fish productivity (169.30 kg/ha), and the lowest level of this trait was grass carp (43.50 kg/ha). Data of mean weight and body length of common carp, grass carp, and silver carp fishes showed a variation of 4.55 kg and 56.25 cm, 6.06 kg and 75.50 cm, as well as 6.30 Kg and 75.05 cm, respectively. This difference can be justified according to the variance of fish length, which on average, 80 grams of weight is obtained per centimeter of fish length. The economic efficiency of carp was calculated, and the net profit was determined at more than 50% of total income. According to the net profit indicator, due to the implementation of a part of the fingerlings, the carp reared in the pond area; as a result, this method is profitable and accounts for 104% of the total planned economic profit. Therefore, fish production from aquaculture can rise to 10 times to maintain high-quality food security and other essential nutrients, provide job opportunities, and cash income to help job-seeking youth. © 2021 Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute.

Further, we tested the socioecological drivers of pyrodiversity among forests of the western United States. Largely mediated by burn activity, pyrodiversity was positively associated with actual evapotranspiration, climate water deficit, wilderness designation, elevation and topographic roughness but negatively with human population density. These results indicate pyrodiversity is highest in productive areas with pronounced annual dry periods and minimal fire suppression.

	abstract = {Drosophila suzukii is a polyphagous pest of small and soft fruit, originating from Asia, which has spread and established in Europe and the USA. Adults exhibit seasonal phenotypes, i.e., summer morphs (SM) and winter morphs (WM) to cope with fluctuating environmental conditions. WM have a darker cuticle and larger wings compared to SM, while WM females experience reproductive dormancy. We studied the life history traits (lifespan, female reproductive status and number of produced offspring) of WM and SM that were exposed to winter field conditions of a coastal and a mainland agricultural area, with mild and cold winter climates, respectively. Mated adults of each phenotype were individually placed in vials bearing nutritional/oviposition substrate, and transferred to the field from November 2019 to May 2020, when the death of the last individual was recorded. Almost all SM females (90%) and no WM female carried mature ovarioles before being transferred to the field. WM exhibited a longer lifespan than SM adjusting for location and sex. Differences in survival between the two phenotypes were more pronounced for adults kept in the mainland area. The majority of SM females produced offspring during overwintering in the mild coastal area, but only a few SM were reproductively active in the cold mainland area. Some WM females produced progeny during overwintering in the mild conditions of the coastal area, but all WM females were in reproductive arrest in the mainland area. Overwintering females in the coastal area had a shorter lifespan and produced more progeny than those kept in the mainland area. High survival rates of WM provide indications of the successful performance of this phenotype in the adverse conditions of the cold climates. Additionally, the continuous reproductive activity of SM females and the onset of progeny production by WM females during overwintering in the coastal area indicate that the insect remains reproductively active throughout the year in areas with mild climatic conditions. Our findings support the successful adaptation of D. suzukii in both areas tested and can be used for the development of area‐specific population models, based on the prevailing climatic conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The compelling need to increase global agricultural production requires new breeding approaches that facilitate exploiting the diversity available in the plant genetic resources. Multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) populations are large sets of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that are a genetic mosaic of multiple founder parents. MAGIC populations display emerging features over experimental bi-parental and germplasm populations in combining significant levels of genetic recombination, a lack of genetic structure, and high genetic and phenotypic diversity. The development of MAGIC populations can be performed using “funnel” or “diallel” cross-designs, which are of great relevance choosing appropriate parents and defining optimal population sizes. Significant advances in specific software development are facilitating the genetic analysis of the complex genetic constitutions of MAGIC populations. Despite the complexity and the resources required in their development, due to their potential and interest for breeding, the number of MAGIC populations available and under development is continuously growing, with 45 MAGIC populations in different crops being reported here. Though cereals are by far the crop group where more MAGIC populations have been developed, MAGIC populations have also started to become available in other crop groups. The results obtained so far demonstrate that MAGIC populations are a very powerful tool for the dissection of complex traits, as well as a resource for the selection of recombinant elite breeding material and cultivars. In addition, some new MAGIC approaches that can make significant contributions to breeding, such as the development of inter-specific MAGIC populations, the development of MAGIC-like populations in crops where pure lines are not available, and the establishment of strategies for the straightforward incorporation of MAGIC materials in breeding pipelines, have barely been explored. The evidence that is already available indicates that MAGIC populations will play a major role in the coming years in allowing for impressive gains in plant breeding for developing new generations of dramatically improved cultivars. © MDPI AG.

	abstract = {The extent of land degradation has reached a level of concern. The land use changes due to burgeoning population have added magnitude to it. The unavailability of agricultural lands and the existence of degraded lands have led science to focus on utilizing the marginal lands and existing arable land resources in the best way possible, to meet the agricultural demand as well as to reduce land degradation. Due to existing plethora of environmental problems (biotic and abiotic stresses) there is reduction in agricultural productivity. The need of the hour is a strategy of integrated approaches which involve methods to reduce the degrading concepts and replacing it with feasible, sustainable, and economically viable approaches. Some of the microbial diversity are boon from the nature’s desk which acts as a root level worker. Some of the investigated microbes have the ability to uplift nutritional profile of soil as well as provide growth promoting traits and tolerance to plants. Plant microbe relation works symbiotically or asymbiotically for the betterment of productivity and overall soil health. This chapter provides an insight of the helpful microbes and their interactions with plants for the mitigation and management of different environmental problems in the agricultural fields. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The extinction of species can destabilize ecological processes. A way to assess the ecological consequences of species loss is by examining changes in functional diversity. The preservation of functional diversity depends on the range of ecological roles performed by species, or functional richness, and the number of species per role, or functional redundancy. However, current knowledge is based on short timescales and an understanding of how functional diversity responds to long-term biodiversity dynamics has been limited by the availability of deep-time, trait-based data. Here, we compile an exceptional trait dataset of fossil molluscs from a 23-million-year interval in the Caribbean Sea (34 011 records, 4422 species) and develop a novel Bayesian model of multi-trait-dependent diversification to reconstruct mollusc (i) diversity dynamics, (ii) changes in functional diversity, and (iii) extinction selectivity over the last 23 Myr. Our results identify high diversification between 23-5 Mya, leading to increases in both functional richness and redundancy. Conversely, over the last three million years, a period of high extinction rates resulted in the loss of 49% of species but only 3% of functional richness. Extinction rates were significantly higher in small, functionally redundant species suggesting that competition mediated the response of species to environmental change. Taken together, our results identify long-term diversification and selective extinction against redundant species that allowed functional diversity to grow over time, ultimately buffering the ecological functions of biological communities against extinction.  © 2020 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Trait-based approaches are increasingly recognized as a tool for understanding ecosystem re-Assembly and function under intensifying global change. Here we synthesize trait-based research globally (n = 865 studies) to examine the contexts in which traits may be used for global change prediction. We find that exponential growth in the field over the last decade remains dominated by descriptive studies of terrestrial plant morphology, highlighting significant opportunities to expand trait-based thinking across systems and taxa. Very few studies (less than 3%) focus on predicting ecological effects of global change, mostly in the past 5 years and via singular traits that mediate abiotic limits on species distribution. Beyond organism size (the most examined trait), we identify over 2500 other morphological, physiological, behavioural and lifehistory traits known to mediate environmental filters of species range and abundance as candidates for future predictive global change work. Though uncommon, spatially explicit process models which mechanistically link traits to changes in organism distributions and abundance are among the most promising frameworks for holistic global change prediction at scales relevant for conservation decision-making. Further progress towards trait-based forecasting requires addressing persistent barriers including (1) matching scales of multivariate trait and environment data to focal processes disrupted by global change, and (2) propagating variation in trait and environmental parameters throughout process model functions using simulation. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

	abstract = {Recent synthesis studies have shown inconsistent responses of crop pests to landscape composition, imposing a fundamental limit to our capacity to design sustainable crop protection strategies to reduce yield losses caused by insect pests. Using a global dataset composed of 5242 observations encompassing 48 agricultural pest species and 26 crop species, we tested the role of pest traits (exotic status, host breadth and habitat breadth) and environmental context (crop type, range in landscape gradient and climate) in modifying the pest response to increasing semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape. For natives, increasing semi-natural habitats decreased the abundance of pests that exploit only crop habitats or that are highly polyphagous. On the contrary, populations of exotic pests increased with an increasing cover of semi-natural habitats. These effects might be related to changes in host plants and other resources across the landscapes and/or to modified top-down control by natural enemies. The range of the landscape gradient explored and climate did not affect pests, while crop type modified the response of pests to landscape composition. Although species traits and environmental context helped in explaining some of the variability in pest response to landscape composition, the observed large interspecific differences suggest that a portfolio of strategies must be considered and implemented for the effective control of rapidly changing communities of crop pests in agroecosystems.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Epigenetics has emerged as an important research field for crop improvement under the on‐going climatic changes. Heritable epigenetic changes can arise independently of DNA sequence alterations and have been associated with altered gene expression and transmitted phenotypic var-iation. By modulating plant development and physiological responses to environmental conditions, epigenetic diversity—naturally, genetically, chemically, or environmentally induced—can help op-timise crop traits in an era challenged by global climate change. Beyond DNA sequence variation, the epigenetic modifications may contribute to breeding by providing useful markers and allowing the use of epigenome diversity to predict plant performance and increase final crop production. Given the difficulties in transferring the knowledge of the epigenetic mechanisms from model plants to crops, various strategies have emerged. Among those strategies are modelling frameworks dedicated to predicting epigenetically controlled‐adaptive traits, the use of epigenetics for in vitro regeneration to accelerate crop breeding, and changes of specific epigenetic marks that modulate gene expression of traits of interest. The key challenge that agriculture faces in the 21st century is to increase crop production by speeding up the breeding of resilient crop species. Therefore, epigenet-ics provides fundamental molecular information with potential direct applications in crop enhance-ment, tolerance, and adaptation within the context of climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Quantifying temporal variation in sex-specific selection on key ecologically relevant traits, and quantifying how such variation arises through synergistic or opposing components of survival and reproductive selection, is central to understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics, but rarely achieved. Seasonal migration versus residence is one key trait that directly shapes spatio-seasonal population dynamics in spatially and temporally varying environments, but temporal dynamics of sex-specific selection have not been fully quantified. We fitted multi-event capture-recapture models to year-round ring resightings and breeding success data from partially migratory European shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) to quantify temporal variation in annual sex-specific selection on seasonal migration versus residence arising through adult survival, reproduction and the combination of both (i.e. annual fitness). We demonstrate episodes of strong and strongly fluctuating selection through annual fitness that were broadly synchronized across females and males. These overall fluctuations arose because strong reproductive selection against migration in several years contrasted with strong survival selection against residence in years with extreme climatic events. These results indicate how substantial phenotypic and genetic variation in migration versus residence could be maintained, and highlight that biologically important fluctuations in selection may not be detected unless both survival selection and reproductive selection are appropriately quantified and combined.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The selection pressures that have shaped the evolution of complex traits in humans remain largely unknown, and in some contexts highly contentious, perhaps above all where they concern mean trait differences among groups. To date, the discussion has focused on whether such group differences have any genetic basis, and if so, whether they are without fitness consequences and arose via random genetic drift, or whether they were driven by selection for different trait optima in different environments. Here, we highlight a plausible alternative: that many complex traits evolve under stabilizing selection in the face of shifting environmental effects. Under this scenario, there will be rapid evolution at the loci that contribute to trait variation, even when the trait optimum remains the same. These considerations underscore the strong assumptions about environmental effects that are required in ascribing trait differences among groups to genetic differences.

	abstract = {In both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, zinc (Zn) plays a significant role as a cofactor for many enzymes and is present in DNA-binding Zn-finger proteins. It also plays a key role in metabolism, mitosis, development, and mitochondrial activity. Zinc has been the second most common transition metal for living organisms and the only metal that occurs in all classes of enzymes. Zinc is abundantly present in the earth’s crust, and the most commonly found forms in the soil include sphalerite, zinc silicate, zinc oxide, zinc phosphate, and zinc carbonate. It is typically present in soil at a concentration of 5–770 ppm, which may vary as various anthropogenic activities such as chemical fertilizer, galvanization, pharmaceutical waste, and other applications release zinc ion in soil. Zn deficiency has become a severe problem affecting nearly half of the world’s population because the plants in Zn-deficient soils are actually low in Zn content. According to the World Health Organization report, the shortage of micronutrients like Zn is a significant challenge to global health and sustainability. Approximately, 50% of the soils in India have zinc deficiency that affect most crop production. The main reasons for the zinc deficiency are higher use of chemical fertilizers, intensive farming, and inadequate irrigation system resulting in reduced zinc content in Indian soils. Although some soil may contain adequate quantities of zinc to sustain crop growth, even then the crops have low zinc status because of the insoluble nature of the zinc found in the soil. This locked zinc can be accessible to plants to support optimal growth if an appropriate technology is developed for the same. Several bacteria, particularly those present in the rhizosphere, possess the ability to solubilize the unavailable forms of a metal and making them bioavailable to plants. Bacillus has been the most prevalent species in plant rhizospheres, accounting for up to 95% of Gram-positive rhizospheric population. Bacillus is one of the most widely studied genera and is known to possess numerous plant growth-promoting traits like nitrogen fixation, minerals solubilization, production of siderophores, antibiotics, and secondary metabolites that have biocontrol properties against plant pathogens. Different mechanisms have been reported in bacteria that assist zinc solubilization like chelation, changes in the soil pH, and proton extrusion. The most widely studied mechanism is secretion of organic acids by the rhizospheric bacteria like gluconic acid, butyric acid, lactic acid, and oxalic acid. Organic acid production increases the availability by sequestration of cations and by decreasing the soil pH. This chapter discusses the potential role of Bacilli rhizobacteria in Zn solubilization and how they can be used for crop production and environmental sustainability. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {Textile industries use several types of synthetic toxic dyes having complex aromatic structures that lead to detrimental effects on ecosystems. Discharge of effluent directly into the natural environment (soil and water) adversely affects the biota. In recent years, different dye removal strategies have been adopted to control textile pollution including physical, chemical, and biological methods. Recently, exploring agro-industrial waste biomasses into biochar is being studied as an economically sustainable approach for remediation of textile wastewater and other environmental pollutants. Biochar is a black carbon produced after the pyrolysis of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions. It is proving the best adsorbent which offers advantages like high surface area, porosity, and active functional groups important for the effective removal of organic and inorganic contaminants. Biochar reduces the bioavailability of contaminants with additional environmental benefits including soil fertilizer and mitigation of climate change. The present book chapter provides a brief outline of dye types and toxicity and biochar preparation and characteristics with a detailed account of mechanism of biochar-assisted remediation of hazardous textile dyes and wastewater. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021, corrected publication 2022.},

	abstract = {Background: Enterobacter cloacae are most frequently isolated from human clinical specimens. Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the dissemination of E. cloacae clinical isolates resistant to β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combinations from different clinical specimens of hospitalized patients. Methods: E. cloacae isolates were recovered from different clinical samples of hospitalized patients in three main hospitals in Baghdad city. E. cloacae isolates were identified based on their morphology and biochemical tests, and the identification was confirmed using Vitek-2 system. The antibiotic susceptibility testing of E. cloacae isolates to a variety of antibiotics was achieved using disc diffusion test (DDT) and Vitek-2 system. Results: Results found that among 335 culture-positive samples, 30 isolates (8.9%) belonged to E. cloacae. A high rate of isolation was observed in urine isolates (46.6%), followed by wounds (burns) isolates (26.6%). Out of 30 E. cloacae strains isolated during this study, 18 (60%) showed reduced susceptibility to BLBLI combinations. TEM genes (TEM-1 and TEM-2) were successfully amplified from 7/18 isolates (38.8%) and high rate of BLBLI genes was detected (CTX-M, bla-SHV, SHV-2, and OXA-1). However, no BLBLI genes of bla-AmpC, bla-OXA-2, and bla-OXA-10 were found in E. cloacae isolates when tested using specific primers for bla-AmpC and bla-OXA genes. Conclusion: From this study, we can conclude that the production of inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases by E. cloacae isolates could be increasingly common in nosocomial pathogens other than E. coli or K. pneumoniae in public hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq. © 2022 Alzaidi and Mohammed.},

	abstract = {Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) occurs when phenotypes are shaped by the environment in both the current and preceding generations. Transgenerational responses to rainfall, CO 2 and temperature suggest that TGP may play an important role in how species cope with climate change. However, little is known about how TGP will evolve as climate change continues. Here, we provide a quantitative test of the hypothesis that the predictability of the environment influences the magnitude of the transgenerational response. To do so, we take advantage of the latitudinal decrease in the predictability of temperatures in near shore waters along the US East Coast. Using sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) from South Carolina, Maryland, and Connecticut, we found the first evidence for a latitudinal gradient in thermal TGP. Moreover, the degree of TGP in these populations depends linearly on the decorrelation time for temperature, providing support for the hypothesis that thermal predictability drives the evolution of these traits.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

Spatio-temporal variation in selection potentially maintains differences, but relationships between metabolic traits (standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and aerobic scope) and fitness across contexts are unresolved. We show that associations between SMR, MMR, and growth rate (a key fitness-related trait) vary depending on the thermal regime (a potential selective agent) in offspring of wild-sampled brown trout from two populations reared for approximately 15 months in either a cool or warm (+1.8°C) regime. SMR was positively related to growth in the cool, but negatively related in the warm regime. The opposite patterns were found for MMR and growth associations (positive in warm, negative in the cool regime). Mean SMR, but not MMR, was lower in warm regimes within both populations (i.e. basal metabolic costs were reduced at higher temperatures), consistent with an adaptive acclimation response that optimizes growth. Metabolic phenotypes thus exhibited a thermally sensitive metabolic 'floor' and a less flexible metabolic 'ceiling'. Our findings suggest a role for growth-related fluctuating selection in shaping patterns of metabolic variation that is likely important in adapting to climate change. © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Salinity conditions in oyster breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to drastically change due to increased precipitation from climate change and anthropogenic changes to local hydrology. We determined the capacity of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, to adapt via standing genetic variation or acclimate through transgenerational plasticity (TGP). We outplanted oysters to either a low- or medium-salinity site in Louisiana for 2 years. We then crossed adult parents using a North Carolina II breeding design, and measured body sizeand survival of larvae 5 dpf raised under low or ambient salinity. We found that TGP is unlikely to significantly contribute to low-salinity tolerance since we did not observe increased growth or survival in offspring reared in low salinity when their parents were also acclimated at a low-salinity site. However, we detected genetic variation for body size, with an estimated heritability of 0.68 ± 0.25 (95% CI). This suggests there is ample genetic variation for this trait to evolve, and that evolutionary adaptation is a possible mechanism through which oysters will persist with future declines in salinity. The results of this experiment provide valuable insights intosuccessfully breeding low-salinity tolerance in this commercially important species.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Understanding factors affecting the functional diversity of ecological communities is an important goal for ecologists and conservationists. Previous work has largely been conducted at the community level; however, recent studies have highlighted the critical importance of considering intraspecific functional diversity (i.e. the functional diversity of phenotypic traits among conspecifics). Further, a major limitation of existing literature on this topic is the lack of empirical studies examining functional diversity of behavioural phenotypes - including animal personalities. This is a major shortcoming because personality traits can affect the fitness of individuals, and the composition of personalities in a population can have important ecological consequences. Our study aims to contribute to filling this knowledge gap by investigating factors affecting the functional diversity of personality traits in wild animal populations. Specifically, we predicted that the richness, divergence and evenness associated with personality traits would be impacted by key components of forest structure and would vary between contrasting forest types. To achieve our objective we conducted a fully replicated large-scale field experiment over a 4 year period using small mammal populations as a model system. We found that greater heterogeneity in the cover of shrubs, coarse woody debris and canopy cover was associated with a greater richness, lower divergence and lower evenness in personality traits. Greater population density was associated with greater functional richness and lower functional divergence and evenness of personality traits. To maintain a behaviourally diverse population and its associated functions, managers may promote heterogeneity in vegetation and increased population density, which we found to be the most important determinants driving functional diversity of personality traits.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

In this study, our results first showed that the expression of UBE2T was higher in both of cervical cancer tissues and cells than that in the normal tissues and cells. Knockdown of UBE2T reduced cervical cancer cell viability and suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration. However, overexpression of UBE2T contributed to cervical cancer cell growth and metastasis. Moreover, UBE2T overexpression cervical cancer cells demonstrated enhanced self-renewal capacity with upregulation of SOX2, Oct-4, and Nanog protein. Silencing of UBE2T downregulated protein expression of SOX2, Oct-4, and Nanog in cervical cancer cells reduced self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, ectopic UBE2T expression promoted protein expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation in cervical cancer cells. The knockdown of UBE2T reduced protein expression of GRP78 and FAK phosphorylation. Collectively, UBE2T promoted cervical cancer stem cell traits and exerted an oncogenic role through activation of the GRP78/FAK pathway.  © 2021 YanMei Liu et al., published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {Although climate-driven phenological shifts have been documented for many taxa across the globe, we still lack knowledge of the consequences they have on populations. Here, we used a comprehensive database comprising 553 populations of 51 species of north-western Mediterranean butterflies to investigate the relationship between phenology and population trends in a 26-year period. Phenological trends and sensitivity to climate, along with various species traits, were used to predict abundance trends. Key ecological traits accounted for a general decline of more than half of the species, most of which, surprisingly, did not change their phenology under a climate warming scenario. However, this was related to the regional cooling in a short temporal window that includes late winter and early spring, during which most species concentrate their development. Finally, we demonstrate that phenological sensitivity - but not phenological trends - predicted population trends, and argue that species that best adjust their phenology to inter-annual climate variability are more likely to maintain a synchronization with trophic resources, thereby mitigating possible negative effects of climate change. Our results reflect the importance of assessing not only species' trends over time but also species' abilities to respond to a changing climate based on their sensitivity to temperature. © 2022 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Life-history traits, which are physical traits or behaviours that affect growth, survivorship and reproduction, could play an important role in how well organisms respond to environmental change. By looking for trait-based responses within groups, we can gain a mechanistic understanding of why environmental change might favour or penalize certain species over others. We monitored the abundance of at least 154 bee species for 8 consecutive years in a subalpine region of the Rocky Mountains to ask whether bees respond differently to changes in abiotic conditions based on their life-history traits. We found that comb-building cavity nesters and larger bodied bees declined in relative abundance with increasing temperatures, while smaller, soil-nesting bees increased. Further, bees with narrower diet breadths increased in relative abundance with decreased rainfall. Finally, reduced snowpack was associated with reduced relative abundance of bees that overwintered as prepupae whereas bees that overwintered as adults increased in relative abundance, suggesting that overwintering conditions might affect body size, lipid content and overwintering survival. Taken together, our results show how climate change may reshape bee pollinator communities, with bees with certain traits increasing in abundance and others declining, potentially leading to novel plant-pollinator interactions and changes in plant reproduction. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

	abstract = {Change in body size is one of the universal responses to global warming, with most species becoming smaller. While small size in most species corresponds to low individual fitness, small species typically show high population growth rates in cross-species comparisons. It is unclear, therefore, how climate-induced changes in body size ultimately affect population persistence. Unravelling the relationship between body size, ambient temperature and individual survival is especially important for the conservation of endangered long-lived mammals such as bats. Using an individual-based 24-year dataset from four free-ranging Bechstein's bat colonies (Myotis bechsteinii), we show for the first time a link between warmer summer temperatures, larger body sizes and increased mortality risk. Our data reveal a crucial time window in June-July, when juveniles grow to larger body sizes in warmer conditions. Body size is also affected by colony size, with larger colonies raising larger offspring. At the same time, larger bats have higher mortality risks throughout their lives. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the link between warmer weather and body size as a fitness-relevant trait for predicting species-specific extinction risks as consequences of global warming. © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A promising, yet still under development approach to cancer treatment is based on the idea of differentiation therapy (DTH). Most tumours are characterized by poorly differentiated cell populations exhibiting a marked loss of traits associated to communication and tissue homeostasis. DTH has been suggested as an alternative (or complement) to cytotoxic-based approaches, and has proven successful in some specific types of cancer such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). While novel drugs favouring the activation of differentiation therapies are being tested, several open problems emerge in relation to its effectiveness on solid tumors. Here we present a mathematical framework to DTH based on a well-known ecological model used to describe habitat loss. The models presented here account for some of the observed clinical and in vitro outcomes of DTH, providing relevant insight into potential therapy design. Furthermore, the same ecological approach is tested in a hierarchical model that accounts for cancer stem cells, highlighting the role of niche specificity in CSC therapy resistance. We show that the lessons learnt from metapopulation ecology can help guide future developments and potential difficulties of DTH. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Soil is identified to be a complex microhabitat for two distinguishing properties. Firstly, the microbial inhabitants in the soil are enormously diverse and secondly, the soil remains a structured, heterogeneous, and discontinuous system, generally poor in essential nutrients and energy sources. Soil microflora plays the most substantial part in the rhizosphere of the higher plants, where the plant growth-promoting traits of beneficial microorganisms influence the soil and plant health. Beneficial microorganisms used to improve agricultural products are broadly termed as Agriculturally Important Microorganisms (AIMs). AIMs represent a wide range of microorganisms which include Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), Biocontrol Agents (BCA), Plant Growth-Promoting Fungi (PGPF), Actinomycetes, Mycorrhiza, and Endophytes. AIMs can influence plant growth and the health of the soil through direct and indirect mechanisms along with molecular signaling. Plant signaling molecules play important roles in efficient root colonization, modulation of root system architecture, cell to cell communication, gene regulation, plant immunity development process, and finally, influence plant health. Integration of Agriculturally Important Microorganisms in agriculture is a promising sustainable solution to improve production, however, commercialization of bioformulations will require addressing a number of issues like a selection of broad-spectrum microbial strains, retention of quality and efficacy under field conditions, and product registration. A rational approach to comprehend the key mechanisms associated with AIMs-Plant interaction and development of model-based inoculum would facilitate productive field application and sustainable agriculture production under the changing climatic conditions. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered as the second major threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction worldwide. They are aggressive competitors and dominate an ecosystem where they introduce and cause reduction in indigenous diversity. Invasive plants alter the evolutionary pathways of native species by competition, niche displacement, hybridization, introgression, predation, and ultimately extinction of native species. Biological invasion also results in economic and environmental damage and harm to human health. Invasive plants have an effective reproductive as well as dispersal mechanisms. Most invasive plants produce abundant fruits and seeds that are widely disseminated and remain viable in the soil for several years. Invasive plants may change their seed character in order to adapt themselves to the new environment and facilitate their performance. A study on seed coat sculpturing in invasive alien plants collected from Lesser Himalaya region, Pakistan, was conducted using scanning electron microscope to determine the importance of seed morphological characters as an additional tool for identification. Quantitative characters such as seed length and width, macromorphological characters including color, hilum position, and seed shape, and micromorphological characters of seed including surface patterns and periclinal and anticlinal wall of seeds were studied. Findings at the present indicate that most of the seeds were found spherical followed by ovate and elliptical in shape with smooth surface and showed terminal hilum. Almost reticulate seed patterns were observed in seeds. Majority of seeds showed raised anticlinal walls with protuberance periclinal walls. The seeds of Xanthium strumarium were observed with maximum length of 13 mm and with width of 8 mm. Length by width ratio of seeds was also calculated; it was found that maximum L/W ratio was observed in Sonchus oleraceus L., i.e., 2.66. Seed characters, both macro- and micromorphological, furnish useful data for classification and delimitation of invasive taxa. This study will help to understand the invasion mechanism in plants due to variations in seed surface, shape, and other characters. Adaptive behavior of the seed during the invasion process of the new ecosystem is also elaborated.  © 2022 Farida Anjum et al.},

The immense complexity of ecological, evolutionary, and spatial processes, however, has made this goal elusive to this day. Computer models serve progress in many scientific fields, but in the fields of macroecology and macroevolution, eco-evolutionary models are comparatively less developed. We present a general, spatially explicit, eco-evolutionary engine with a modular implementation that enables the modeling of multiple macroecological and macroevolutionary processes and feedbacks across representative spatiotemporally dynamic landscapes. Modeled processes can include species' abiotic tolerances, biotic interactions, dispersal, speciation, and evolution of ecological traits. Commonly observed biodiversity patterns, such as α, β, and γ. diversity, species ranges, ecological traits, and phylogenies, emerge as simulations proceed. As an illustration, we examine alternative hypotheses expected to have shaped the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) during the Earth's Cenozoic era. Our exploratory simulations simultaneously produce multiple realistic biodiversity patterns, such as the LDG, current species richness, and range size frequencies, as well as phylogenetic metrics. The model engine is open source and available as an R package, enabling future exploration of various landscapes and biological processes, while outputs can be linked with a variety of empirical biodiversity patterns.

	abstract = {It has recently come to our attention that we made a coding error while implementing the hierarchical mixed-models describing chick condition and chick survival (equations (2.1) and (2.2), respectively) in 'Bayesian inference reveals positive but subtle effects of experimental fishery closures on marine predator demographics' [1]. This error meant that the nested random effect described in equation (2.1) and the hierarchical shared frailty term described in equation (2.2) were not implemented correctly in the original analysis. This resulted in our reporting the model parameter estimates with higher precision than should have been the case (table 1 and figure 1). Here we present corrected results (table 1 and figure 1) based on correctly specified models in JAGS [2] applied to the datasets used in our original analysis. Our error, which pertained to the specification of the structure of the priors for the nested random effects (see electronic supplementary material), influenced the derived parameter estimates of the mean chick condition or chick survival during closed and open years (figure 1) more (standard deviations are between 29% and 285% larger in the corrected results) than the estimates for the regression coefficients representing the island effect (-0.8 to 9%), closure effect (4-8%) or their interaction (6-8%). These changes do not alter the predicted influence of the fisheries closures on the population dynamics of endangered African penguins Spheniscus demersus. In our original analysis, we used vague uniform prior distributions, Uniform(0, 100), to assign the standard deviations for the variance components of the random effects and residual error. In the updated analysis this choice led to poor mixing of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains for the regression parameters in all models. The choice of vague priors for the variance terms associated with the hierarchical random effects can affect model convergence and inference [3,4]. However, Gelman [3] recommends using a half-Cauchy distribution with scale = 25 as a vague prior for the variance terms associated with the hierarchical random effects (and any reasonable vague prior distribution for the residual standard deviation). The probability density function for the half-Cauchy distribution with scale = 25 has its maximum value at x = 0, but remains high over values x < 50, falling off gradually beyond this point (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). Here, half-Cauchy(25) for the variance terms associated with the hierarchical random effects and Uniform(0, 10) for the residual standard deviation led to good convergence for our datasets. For the chick condition models we ran three MCMC chains of 100 000 samples, discarded the first 50 000 as burn-in and drew inference from the rest of the chains with no thinning. To account for the additional complexity of the chick survival model, we ran three chains of 200 000 samples, discarding the first 100 000 as burn-in, and thinned the chain to every second iteration. All models unambiguously converged (all R values ≤ 1.01, smallest effective sample size in any model = 721). All other methods were as described in our original analysis [1]. Unless otherwise specified, all results are posterior means 95% credible intervals (CRI). The corrected results (table 1 and figure 1) yield very similar point estimates to the results published in the original paper, but with wider 95% CRI (figure 1a.c). In the original paper, we reported that chick condition at Robben Island improved significantly and unambiguously by 45% in the absence of fishing, and that the fisheries closures improved chick survival by approximately 11% at both Dassen Island and Robben Island (table 1), with essentially no uncertainty in the differences between the means for either island (nonoverlapping 95% CRI). Both of these closure effects remain credibly different from zero at the 95% level in the corrected results and the effect sizes remain similar (48% and 10% for condition and survival, respectively; table 1). By contrast, the 95% CRI for the derived estimates of chick survival in years that were 'open' to fishing and 'closed' to fishing now overlap at both Dassen Island and Robben Island (figure 1c), meaning that there is more uncertainty in this case than we originally reported. This is probably because unmodelled sources of random effect variance often have little effect on the parameter estimates for the fixed effects (e.g. the closure effect) but manifest as additional residual variance [5] (i.e. the 'missing' uncertainty was in the residual error rather than the random intercepts). Incorporating the corrected results into the population projection models used in the original paper did not change (apart from some MCMC rounding, table 1) the predicted population level effects (figure 1d here, fig. 2c in the original paper). This probably reflects the similarities between the point estimates and effect sizes on which the closure effects are based (shown in figure 1a,c) in the corrected and original analyses (table 1), and because the majority of the uncertainty in the population projection models already came from parameter uncertainty in mean juvenile survival (from fledging to age one) due to high variation in that trait over time [6]. Accordingly, our original conclusions that fisheries closures could provide subtle improvements in the population trend of a forage-fish-dependent predator are still supported by the corrected results. © 2021 Royal Society Publishing.

	abstract = {Populations within species often exhibit variation in traits that reflect local adaptation and further shape existing adaptive potential for species to respond to climate change. However, our mechanistic understanding of how the environment shapes trait variation remains poor. Here, we used common garden experiments to quantify thermal performance in eight populations of the marine snail Urosalpinx cinerea across thermal gradients on the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of North America. We then evaluated the relationship between thermal performance and environmental metrics derived from time-series data. Our results reveal a novel pattern of 'mixed' trait performance adaptation, where thermal optima were positively correlated with spawning temperature (cogradient variation), while maximum trait performance was negatively correlated with season length (countergradient variation). This counterintuitive pattern probably arises because of phenological shifts in the spawning season, whereby 'cold' populations delay spawning until later in the year when temperatures are warmer compared to 'warm' populations that spawn earlier in the year when temperatures are cooler. Our results show that variation in thermal performance can be shaped by multiple facets of the environment and are linked to organismal phenology and natural history. Understanding the impacts of climate change on organisms, therefore, requires the knowledge of how climate change will alter different aspects of the thermal environment.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Responses to climate change are particularly complicated in species that engage in symbioses, as the niche of one partner may be modified by that of the other. We explored thermal traits in gut symbionts of honeybees and bumblebees, which are vulnerable to rising temperatures. In vitro assays of symbiont strains isolated from 16 host species revealed variation in thermal niches. Strains from bumblebees tended to be less heat-tolerant than those from honeybees, possibly due to bumblebees maintaining cooler nests or inhabiting cooler climates. Overall, however, bee symbionts grew at temperatures up to 44°C and withstood temperatures up to 52°C, at or above the upper thermal limits of their hosts. While heat-tolerant, most strains of the symbiont Snodgrassella grew relatively slowly below 35°C, perhaps because of adaptation to the elevated body temperatures that bees maintain through thermoregulation. In a gnotobiotic bumblebee experiment, Snodgrassella was unable to consistently colonize bees reared at 29°C under conditions that limit thermoregulation. Thus, host thermoregulatory behaviour appears important in creating a warm microenvironment for symbiont establishment. Bee-microbiome-temperature interactions could affect host health and pollination services, and inform research on the thermal biology of other specialized gut symbionts.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Microbial inoculants are an important tool for increasing arable land productivity and decreasing mineral fertilizer application. This study was aimed at isolating and identifying endophytic antagonistic bacteria from lily (Lilium davidii var. unicolor) roots grown in Northwestern China and at evaluating their antifungal activity and plant growth-promoting characteristics. For this purpose, endophytic bacteria were isolated from plant roots, and plant growth-promoting strains were identified. One bacterial strain, isolated from the root part, was identified as Bacillus halotolerans based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and was designated as LBG-1-13. The strain showed antagonistic activities against important plant pathogens of lily including Botrytis cinerea, Botryosphaeria dothidea, and Fusarium oxysporum. The highest percentage of growth inhibition, i.e., 71.65±2.39%, was observed for LBG-1-13 against Botryosphaeria dothidea followed by 68.33±4.70% and 48.22±4.11% against Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium oxysporum, respectively. Meanwhile, the isolated strain also showed plant growth-promoting traits such as the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, ACC deaminase, and phosphate solubilization activity. The strain showed ACC deaminase activity and was able to cleave 58.41±2.62 nmol α-ketobutyrate (mg protein)-1 min-1. The strain exhibited tolerance to salt and drought stress in an in vitro experiment. The strain LBG-1-13 was able to grow in the presence of 10% NaCl and 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the growth medium. Inoculation of Lilium varieties, Tresor and Bright Diamond, with LBG-1-13 enhanced plant growth under greenhouse and field conditions, respectively. All these results demonstrated that Bacillus halotolerans LBG-1-13 could be utilized as a good candidate in the biocontrol of lily disease and plant growth promotion in sustainable agriculture.  © 2022 Jun-lian Gao et al.},

	abstract = {With accelerating global warming, understanding the evolutionary dynamics of plant adaptation to environmental change is increasingly urgent. Here we reveal the enigmatic history of the genus Cochlearia (Brassicaceae), a Pleistocene relic that originated from a drought-adapted Mediterranean sister genus during the Miocene. Cochlearia rapidly diversified and adapted to circum-Arctic regions and other cold-characterized habitat types during the Pleistocene. This sudden change in ecological preferences was accompanied by a highly complex, reticulate polyploid evolution, which was apparently triggered by the impact of repeated Pleistocene glaciation cycles. Our results illustrate that two early diversified arctic-alpine diploid gene pools contributed differently to the evolution of this young polyploid genus now captured in a cold-adapted niche. Metabolomics revealed central carbon metabolism responses to cold in diverse species and ecotypes, likely due to continuous connections to cold habitats that may have facilitated widespread adaptation to alpine and subalpine habitats, and which we speculate were coopted from existing drought adaptations. Given the growing scientific interest in adaptive evolution of temperature-related traits, our results provide much-needed taxonomic and phylogenomic resolution of a model system as well as first insights into the origins of its adaptation to cold. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

However, the formation of more AA entangles with modern-day fast food industries, and a considerable amount of this ingredient is being consumed by fast food eaters inadvertently throughout the world. This article reviews the factors responsible for AA formation pathways, investigation techniques of AA, toxicity, and health-related issues followed by mitigation methods that have been studied in the past few decades comprehensively. Predominantly, AA and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) are produced via the Maillard reaction and can be highlighted as the major heat-induced toxins formulated in bread and bakery products. Epidemiological studies have shown that there is a strong relationship between AA accumulation in the body and the increased risk of cancers. The scientific community is still in a dearth of technology in producing AA-free starch-protein-fat-based thermally processed food products. Therefore, this paper may facilitate the food scientists to their endeavor in developing mitigation techniques pertaining to the formation of AA and HMF in baked foods in the future. © 2021 Dilini N.

	abstract = {Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) was renowned in the ancient ages for the stability of its healthy oil, accessibility of extraction, and drought resilience. Consequently, to produce novel varieties, the present work entails the utilization of basic metrics of variability and genetic variation. The investigation included 60 sesame genotypes and 13 quantitative characteristics. The analysis of variance revealed that genotypes were significant for all of the parameters assessed (P>0.05 and P>0.01). The average seed yield per plant was 6.93g, ranging from 4.84 to 9.17g. In all of the traits studied, the phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) was greater than the genotypic coefficient of variance (GCV). The tense relationship between PCV and GCV values indicated that the environment had minimal impact on the expression of the traits under investigation. The no. of branches, no. of capsules/axil, capsules per plant, no. of seeds per capsule, and oil content suggested higher estimations of PCV and GCV. The heritability varied from 75.13% for seed width to 99.03% for no. of capsules/axil. The genetic advance (GA) percent means varied from 7.71 (seed length) to 110.93 (no. of capsules/axil) at 5% selection intensity. plant height, no. of branches, 1000 seed weight, capsule length, capsules per plant, no. of seeds per capsule, seed thickness, oil content, and seed yield per plant all showed substantial heredity and a high GA% mean. Because of this, the traits of additive genetic control and direct selection in sesame have a high potential for increasing its yield. ©: Author (s). Publishing rights @ ANSF.},

	abstract = {Biomedical and clinical sciences are experiencing a renewed interest in the fact that males and females differ in many anatomic, physiological, and behavioural traits. Sex differences in trait variability, however, are yet to receive similar recognition. In medical science, mammalian females are assumed to have higher trait variability due to estrous cycles (the ‘estrus-mediated variability hypothesis’); historically in biomedical research, females have been excluded for this reason. Contrastingly, evolutionary theory and associated data support the ‘greater male variability hypothesis’. Here, we test these competing hypotheses in 218 traits measured in >26,900 mice, using meta-analysis methods. Neither hypothesis could universally explain patterns in trait variability. Sex bias in variability was trait-dependent. While greater male variability was found in morphological traits, females were much more variable in immunological traits. Sex-specific variability has eco-evolutionary ramifications, including sex-dependent responses to climate change, as well as statistical implications including power analysis considering sex difference in variance. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

However, life-history theory predicts that reproductive fitness - another key determinant of invasion dynamics - may be lower for more dispersive strains. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that unexpected invasion dynamics emerge from the combination of heritable dispersal polymorphism, dispersal-fitness trade-offs, and mutation between strains. We show that the invasion dynamics are determined by the trade-off relationship between dispersal and population growth rates of the constituent strains. We find that invasion dynamics can be 'anomalous' (i.e. faster than any of the strains in isolation), but that the ultimate invasion speed is determined by the traits of, at most, two strains. The model is simple but generic, so we expect the predictions to apply to a wide range of ecological, evolutionary, or epidemiological invasions.  © 2021 The Authors.},

Yet, few studies have considered the interaction between pharmaceuticals and other chronic stressors contemporaneously, even though the environmental challenges confronting animals in the wild seldom, if ever, occur in isolation. Thermal stress is one such environmental challenge that may modify the threat of pharmaceutical pollutants. Accordingly, we investigated how fluoxetine (Prozac), a common psychotherapeutic and widespread pollutant, interacts with temperature to affect life-history traits in the water flea, Daphnia magna. We chronically exposed two genotypes of Daphnia to two ecological relevant concentrations of fluoxetine (30 ng l -1 and 300 ng l -1) and a concentration representing levels used in acute toxicity tests (3000 ng l -1) and quantified the change in phenotypic trajectories at two temperatures (20°C and 25°C). Across multiple life-history traits, we found that fluoxetine exposure impacted the fecundity, body size and intrinsic growth rate of Daphnia in a non-monotonic manner at 20°C, and often in genotypic-specific ways. At 25°C, however, the life-history phenotypes of individuals converged under the widely varying levels of fluoxetine, irrespective of genotype. Our study underscores the importance of considering the complexity of interactions that can occur in the wild when assessing the effects of chemical pollutants on life-history traits.  © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {While the fundamental biophysics of C 3 photosynthesis is highly conserved across plants, substantial leaf structural and enzymatic variation translates into variability in rates of carbon assimilation. Although this variation is well documented, it remains poorly understood how photosynthetic rates evolve, and whether macroevolutionary changes are related to the evolution of leaf morphology and biochemistry. A substantial challenge in large-scale comparative studies is disentangling evolutionary adaptation from environmental acclimation. We overcome this by using a 'macroevolutionary common garden' approach in which we measured metabolic traits (J max and V cmax) from 111 phylogenetically diverse species in a shared environment. We find substantial phylogenetic signal in these traits at moderate phylogenetic timescales, but this signal dissipates quickly at deeper scales. Morphological traits exhibit phylogenetic signal over much deeper timescales, suggesting that these are less evolutionarily constrained than metabolic traits. Furthermore, while morphological and biochemical traits (LMA, N area and C area) are weakly predictive of J max and V c max, evolutionary changes in these traits are mostly decoupled from changes in metabolic traits. This lack of tight evolutionary coupling implies that it may be incorrect to use changes in these functional traits in response to global change to infer that photosynthetic strategy is also evolving. © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {While the climate and human-induced forest degradation is increasing in the Amazon, fire impacts on forest dynamics remain understudied in the wetter regions of the basin, which are susceptible to large wildfires only during extreme droughts. To address this gap, we installed burned and unburned plots immediately after a wildfire in the northern Purus-Madeira (Central Amazon) during the 2015 El-Niño. We measured all individuals with diameter of 10 cm or more at breast height and conducted recensuses to track the demographic drivers of biomass change over 3 years. We also assessed how stem-level growth and mortality were influenced by fire intensity (proxied by char height) and tree morphological traits (size and wood density). Overall, the burned forest lost 27.3% of stem density and 12.8% of biomass, concentrated in small and medium trees. Mortality drove these losses in the first 2 years and recruitment decreased in the third year. The fire increased growth in lower wood density and larger sized trees, while char height had transitory strong effects increasing tree mortality. Our findings suggest that fire impacts are weaker in the wetter Amazon. Here, trees of greater sizes and higher wood densities may confer a margin of fire resistance; however, this may not extend to higher intensity fires arising from climate change.  © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Climate change is dramatically changing ecosystem composition and productivity, leading scientists to consider the best approaches to map natural resistance and foster ecosystem resilience in the face of these changes. Here we present results from a large-scale experimental assessment of coral bleaching resistance, a critical trait for coral population persistence as oceans warm, in 221 colonies of the coral Acropora hyacinthus across 37 reefs in Palau. We find that bleaching resistant individuals inhabit most reefs but are found more often in warmer microhabitats. Our survey also found wide variation in symbiont concentration among colonies, and that colonies with lower symbiont load tended to be more bleaching resistant. By contrast, our data show that low symbiont load comes at the cost of lower growth rate, a tradeoff that may operate widely among corals across environments. Corals with high bleaching resistance have been suggested as a source for habitat restoration or selective breeding in order to increase coral reef resilience to climate change. Our maps show where these resilience corals can be found, but the existence of tradeoffs with heat resistance may suggest caution in unilateral use of this one trait in restoration. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Simple Summary: Water scarcity is one of the main threats for the future of agriculture and the worldwide population. Improving the ability of crop species to grow and survive with less water is therefore essential. A fundamental goal of most scientists working in this area is to understand the mechanisms plants must potentiate to better survive under reduced water availability. Here we provide evidence that accumulation of anthocyanins, a major player in red leaf color, may fulfil two important functions. First, they serve as a filter for protecting plants against excessive sunlight; second, they control plant water loss by reducing stomatal transpiration and density. Since excessive sunlight and temperature, associated with climate change, come along with water shortage, these pigments may protect and help plants to survive throughout hot and dry seasons. Our results have important social implications for people living in areas where rising temperatures and water shortages are already critical. Breeding programs to obtain crops with these stress tolerance traits can be specifically designed for these environments. Abiotic stresses will be one of the major challenges for worldwide food supply in the near future. Therefore, it is important to understand the physiological mechanisms that mediate plant responses to abiotic stresses. When subjected to UV, salinity or drought stress, plants accumulate specialized metabolites that are often correlated with their ability to cope with the stress. Among them, anthocyanins are the most studied intermediates of the phenylpropanoid pathway. However, their role in plant response to abiotic stresses is still under discussion. To better understand the effects of anthocyanins on plant physiology and morphogenesis, and their implications on drought stress tolerance, we used transgenic tobacco plants (AN1), which over-accumulated anthocyanins in all tissues. AN1 plants showed an altered phenotype in terms of leaf gas exchanges, leaf morphology, anatomy and metabolic profile, which conferred them with a higher drought tolerance compared to the wild-type plants. These results provide important insights for understanding the functional reason for anthocyanin accumulation in plants under stress. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Drought stress has devastating impacts on faba bean production, particularly with the current abrupt climate changes in arid environments. Hence, it is essential to identify drought-tolerant genotypes. The present study aimed at assessing six faba bean genotypes under three irrigation levels during two winter successive growing seasons (2018/2019 and 2019/2020). The applied irrigation levels were well-watered (every 4 days (D1), moderate drought every 8 days (D2), and severe drought 12 days (D3)) regimes. The analysis of variance exhibited highly significant differences among genotypes, irrigation treatments, and their interactions for all studied traits, except the number of pods plant-1 in the first season. Yield traits of all assessed genotypes decreased significantly with increasing drought stress. Otherwise, proline content (Pro) increased significantly with increasing drought stress. The genotypes Giza.843, Nubaria.2, and Nubaria.3 recorded the highest values of plant height, number of branches/plant, pods/plant, pods weight/plant, 100 seed weight, seed yield/plant, and seed yield/kg under drought stress. Similarly, the highest Pro was displayed by Giza.843 and Nubaria.3 under drought stress in both seasons. Furthermore, Giza.843, Nubaria.2, and Nubaria.3 genotypes had the highest values for most tolerant indices. Accordingly, these genotypes could be exploited in developing drought-tolerant and high-yielding faba bean genotypes in arid environments through breeding programs.  © 2022 Manal S.

CT images were taken from the femurs of adult males (Initial/Early Jomon Period (n=10) and Late Jomon Period (n=5)). Cross-sectional images of the diaphysis from below the lesser trochanter to above the adductor tubercle were obtained using the method established by Imamura et al. (2019) and Imamura et al. (2021). Using Excel formulas and macros, the area of cortical bone, thickness, and degree of curvature were quantitatively analyzed. The results were compared with data on modern Japanese. The maximum thickness of cortical bone in the diaphysis and the degree of the anterior curvature were significantly greater in Late Jomon humans than in the other groups. In contrast to modern humans, the majority of Jomon femurs showed the S-shaped curvature with the medial side at the top position and the lateral side at the lower position. The present results demonstrate that Late Jomon humans had a wider range of activity than the other groups and also provide insights into diseases in the hip and knee joints of Jomon humans.  © 2022 Daisuke Endo et al.},

L) is a major staple millet consumed in India, particularly Karnataka and is a rich source of protein and nu-trients. A field study in half-acre was carried out with pranic energy treatment to seed, land and crop and along with control (without energy treatment). The traits of finger millet like plant height (26%), number of productive tillers (35%), no of panicle (54%), number of fingers (13%) and grain yield (44%) were statistically (p <. 05) higher over control. Protein content in finger millet straw (4.38 %) and grain (6.13%) was higher in pranic treatment than control (3.5 and 4.75%). Nitrogen and zinc content in millet grain was higher in pranic treatment (980 and 1.96 mg/100g) than control (760 and 1.63 mg/100g). The increase in protein, nitrogen and zinc content of the millet grain and straw will help to improve the quality of produce for consumption by cattle and humans. Increase in straw and grain yield will help to improve the economy of the farmer. Further studies are need-ed to know the actual mechanisms involved in the growth and yield improvement of finger millet. And, also in-depth studies are necessary to address the reasons behind the variation in nutrients accumulation in straw and grain. © Author (s).},

The current chapter will inculcate knowledge on the various traits such as phosphate solubilization, ammonia production by biological nitrogen fixation, siderophore production, HCN production, and ACC, that is, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase production for the enhancement of plant growth. Quorum sensing (QS) is one of the major signaling mechanisms which directly aids in biofilm formation and also helps in the production of synthesis of plant growth hormones. These compounds also act as an important element for the communication within and between the organisms. Many of the PGPR bacterial strains are found to increase the biosynthesis of essential oils in aromatic plants. PGPR is found to help modulate the growth of the plants as well as to induce systemic resistance against plant pathogens. Studies also determine the involvement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) producing PGPR, made helpful for agriculture purposes as it increases the plant biomass, plant productivity, disease resistance, and plant physiological parameters. Similarly, it could also persuade the tolerance toward the drought stress due to environmental issues and salinity which further initiates toward the improvement of iron and sulfur-like nutrients in plants. This chapter provides an insight into the VOCs produced by PGPR and its potential for plant growth promotion, through several mechanisms. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Changes in primary productivity have the potential to substantially alter food webs, with positive outcomes for some species and negative outcomes for others. Understanding the environmental context and species traits that give rise to these divergent outcomes is a major challenge to the generality of both theoretical and applied ecology. In aquatic systems, nutrient-mediated eutrophication has led to major declines in species diversity, motivating us to seek terrestrial analogues using a large-mammal system across 598 000 km 2 of the Canadian boreal forest. These forests are undergoing some of the most rapid rates of land-use change on Earth and are home to declining caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. Using satellite-derived estimates of primary productivity, coupled with estimates of moose (Alces alces) and wolf (Canis lupus) abundance, we used path analyses to discriminate among hypotheses explaining how habitat alteration can affect caribou population growth. Hypotheses included food limitation, resource dominance by moose over caribou, and apparent competition with predators shared between moose and caribou. Results support apparent competition and yield estimates of wolf densities (1.8 individuals 1000 km -2) above which caribou populations decline. Our multi-trophic analysis provides insight into the cascading effects of habitat alteration from forest cutting that destabilize terrestrial predator-prey dynamics. Finally, the path analysis highlights why conservation actions directed at the proximate cause of caribou decline have been more successful in the near term than those directed further along the trophic chain.  © 2021 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Brassica juncea, an allotetraploid species, is an important germplasm resource for canola improvement, due to its many beneficial agronomic traits, such as heat and drought tolerance and blackleg resistance. Receptor-like kinase (RLK) and receptor-like protein (RLP) genes are two types of resistance gene analogues (RGA) that play important roles in plant innate immunity, stress response and various development processes. In this study, genome wide analysis of RLKs and RLPs is performed in B. juncea. In total, 493 RLKs (LysM-RLKs and LRR-RLKs) and 228 RLPs (LysM-RLPs and LRR-RLPs) are identified in the genome of B. juncea, using RGAugury. Only 13.54% RLKs and 11.79% RLPs are observed to be grouped within gene clusters. The majority of RLKs (90.17%) and RLPs (52.83%) are identified as duplicates, indicating that gene duplications significantly contribute to the expansion of RLK and RLP families. Comparative analysis between B. juncea and its progenitor species, B. rapa and B. nigra, indicate that 83.62% RLKs and 41.98% RLPs are conserved in B. juncea, and RLPs are likely to have a faster evolution than RLKs. This study provides a valuable resource for the identification and characterisation of candidate RLK and RLP genes. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {A perilous increase in the number of bacterial infections has led to developing throngs of antibiotics for increasing the quality and expectancy of life. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is becoming resistant to all known conventional antimicrobial agents thereby posing a deadly threat to the human population. Nowadays, targeting virulence traits of infectious agents is an alternative approach to antimicrobials that is gaining much popularity to fight antimicrobial resistance. Quorum sensing (QS) involves interspecies communication via a chemical signaling pathway. Under this mechanism, cells work in a concerted manner, communicate with each other with the help of signaling molecules called autoinducers (AI). The virulence of these strains is driven by genes, whose expression is regulated by AI, which in turn acts as transcriptional activators. Moreover, the problem of antibiotic-resistance in case of infections caused by P. aeruginosa becomes more alarming among immune-compromised patients, where the infectious agents easily take over the cellular machinery of the host while hidden in the QS mediated biofilms. Inhibition of the QS circuit of P. aeruginosa by targeting various signaling pathways such as LasR, RhlR, Pqs, and QScR transcriptional proteins will help in blocking downstream signal transducers which could result in reducing the bacterial virulence. The anti-virulence agent does not pose an immediate selective pressure on growing bacterium and thus reduces the pathogenicity without harming the target species. Here, we review exclusively, the growing emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and the critical literature survey of QS inhibitors with their potential application of blocking P. aeruginosa infections. © 2021 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

Four SSR loci associated with resistance to PP were detected, two on chromosome 8, explaining 7.43% and 3.72% of the Phenotypic Variation (%PV), one on chromosome 2 explaining 2.71%PV and one on chromosome 3 explaining 1.93%PV. A functional domains-based annotation was carried out, in two Theobroma cacao (CRIOLLO and MATINA) reference genomes, of 20 QTL regions associated with cocoa resistance to the pathogen. It was identified 164 (genome CRIOLLO) and 160 (genome MATINA) candidate genes, hypothetically involved in the recognition and activation of responses in the interaction with the pathogen. Genomic regions rich in genes with Coiled-coils (CC), nucleotide binding sites (NBS) and Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains were identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 6, 8, and 10, likewise, regions rich in Receptor-like Kinase domain (RLK) and Ginkbilobin2 (GNK2) domains were identified in chromosomes 4 and 6. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Climate change mainly alters the plant phyllosphere and rhizosphere resource allocations. Compared with shoot parameters, there is less information about how roots, especially root system architecture (RSA) and their interactions with others, may re-spond to elevated temperature changes. These responses could greatly influence different species acquisition of resources and their competition with their neighbours. The main aim of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of ambient temperature (T1) and elevated temperature (+4o C) (T2) in Open-top chamber (OTC) on root traits and microbial interaction changes in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). A pot experiment was conducted at the Department of Crop Physiology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural Uni-versity, Coimbatore, during 2020-2021 to investigate the root traits and microbial interactions. Cotton varieties, namely KC3, SVPR6, TSH325, TSH357 and TSH375 were screened at the seedling level for cellular thermo tolerance and further, at the root level, these selected varieties were studied against the elevated temperature condition for 10 days in OTC during the stage of flowering to boll development period along with control temperature condition. Root interactions' intensity and direction may fluctuate as a result of variations in RSA responses between species. Negative root interactions could become more intense under high temperature circumstances and species with bigger roots and greater early root growth had stronger competitive advantages. The present findings showed that elevated temperatures promote various microbial growths in the geothermal regions, enhancing the root angle and root length of cotton species. Among the genotypes, KC3 and SVPR6 performed better under elevated temperatures. © 2022, Applied and Natural Science Foundation. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As is common in biological invasions, the rate at which cane toads (Rhinella marina) have spread across tropical Australia has accelerated through time. Individuals at the invasion front travel further than range-core conspecifics and exhibit distinctive morphologies that may facilitate rapid dispersal. However, the links between these morphological changes and locomotor performance have not been clearly documented. We used raceway trials and high-speed videography to document locomotor traits (e.g. hop distances, heights, velocities, and angles of take-off and landing) of toads from range-core and invasion-front populations. Locomotor performance varied geographically, and this variation in performance was linked to morphological features that have evolved during the toads' Australian invasion. Geographical variation in morphology and locomotor ability was evident not only in wild-caught animals, but also in individuals that had been raised under standardized conditions in captivity. Our data thus support the hypothesis that the cane toad's invasion across Australia has generated rapid evolutionary shifts in dispersal-relevant performance traits, and that these differences in performance are linked to concurrent shifts in morphological traits.  © 2020 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Predator-prey interactions influence prey traits through both consumptive and non-consumptive effects, and variation in these traits can shape vector-borne disease dynamics. Meta-analysis methods were employed to generate predation effect sizes by different categories of predators and mosquito prey. This analysis showed that multiple families of aquatic predators are effective in consumptively reducing mosquito survival, and that the survival of Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex mosquitoes is negatively impacted by consumptive effects of predators. Mosquito larval size was found to play a more important role in explaining the heterogeneity of consumptive effects from predators than mosquito genus. Mosquito survival and body size were reduced by non-consumptive effects of predators, but development time was not significantly impacted. In addition, Culex vectors demonstrated predator avoidance behavior during oviposition. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that predators limit disease transmission by reducing both vector survival and vector size, and that associations between drought and human West Nile virus cases could be driven by the vector behavior of predator avoidance during oviposition. These findings are likely to be useful to infectious disease modelers who rely on vector traits as predictors of transmission. © Russell et al.},

Among these complex carcinogenesis processes, cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), and angiogenesis are the major causes for the occurrence of metastasis and chemoresistance which account for cancer malignancy. MicroRNAs packaged and secreted in exosomes are termed “exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs)". Nowadays, more researches have uncovered the roles of exosomal miRNAs played in BC metastasis. In this review, we recapitulated the dual actions of exosomal miRNAs exerted in the aggressiveness of BC by influencing migration, invasion, and distant metastasis. Next, we presented how exosomal miRNAs modify angiogenesis and stemness maintenance. Clinically, several exosomal miRNAs can govern the transformation between drug sensitivity and chemoresistance. Since the balance of the number and type of exosomal miRNAs is disturbed in pathological conditions, they are able to serve as instructive biomarkers for BC diagnosis and prognosis. More efforts are needed to connect the theoretical studies and clinical traits together. This review provides an outline of the pleiotropic impacts of exosomal miRNAs on BC metastasis and their clinical implications, paving the way for future personalized drugs. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Predicting the effects of seasonality and climate change on the emergence and spread of infectious disease remains difficult, in part because of poorly understood connections between warming and the mechanisms driving disease. Trait-based mechanistic models combined with thermal performance curves arising from the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) have been highlighted as a promising approach going forward; however, this framework has not been tested under controlled experimental conditions that isolate the role of gradual temporal warming on disease dynamics and emergence. Here, we provide experimental evidence that a slowly warming host-parasite system can be pushed through a critical transition into an epidemic state. We then show that a trait-based mechanistic model with MTE functional forms can predict the critical temperature for disease emergence, subsequent disease dynamics through time and final infection prevalence in an experimentally warmed system of Daphnia and a microsporidian parasite. Our results serve as a proof of principle that trait-based mechanistic models using MTE subfunctions can predict warming-induced disease emergence in data-rich systems - a critical step towards generalizing the approach to other systems.  © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Developing a thorough understanding of how ectotherm physiology adapts to different thermal environments is of crucial importance, especially in the face of global climate change. A key aspect of an organism’s thermal performance curve (TPC)—the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature—is its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase with temperature within its typically experienced thermal range. For a given trait, the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, often quantified as “activation energy” values, is typically right-skewed. Currently, the mechanisms that generate this distribution are unclear, with considerable debate about the role of thermodynamic constraints versus adaptive evolution. Here, using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we study the evolution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), 2 microbial groups that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. We find that thermal sensitivity across these groups is moderately phylogenetically heritable, and that its distribution is shaped by repeated evolutionary convergence throughout its parameter space. More precisely, we detect bursts of adaptive evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing the amount of overlap among its distributions in different clades. We obtain qualitatively similar results from evolutionary analyses of the thermal sensitivities of 2 physiological rates underlying growth rate: net photosynthesis and respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that these episodes of evolutionary convergence are consistent with 2 opposing forces: decrease in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations and increase due to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results indicate that adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in thermal sensitivity, especially in microbes for which rapid evolution can occur at short timescales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal sensitivity for ecosystem functioning. © 2020 Kontopoulos et al.

	abstract = {In an era of coral reef degradation, our knowledge of ecological patterns in reefs is biased towards large conspicuous organisms. The majority of biodiversity, however, inhabits small cryptic spaces within the framework of the reef. To assess this biodiverse community, which we term the 'reef cryptobiome', we deployed 87 autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS), on 22 reefs across 16 degrees latitude of the Red Sea. Combining ARMS with metabarcoding of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene, we reveal a rich community, including the identification of 14 metazoan phyla within 10 416 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). While mobile and sessile subsets were similarly structured along the basin, the main environmental driver was different (particulate organic matter and sea surface temperature, respectively). Distribution patterns of OTUs showed that only 1.5% were present in all reefs, while over half were present in a single reef. On both local and regional scales, the majority of OTUs were rare. The high heterogeneity in community patterns of the reef cryptobiome has implications for reef conservation. Understanding the biodiversity patterns of this critical component of reef functioning will enable a sound knowledge of how coral reefs will respond to future anthropogenic impacts. © 2019 The Author(s)},

Segregated endophytes were screened for their PGP traits, abiotic stresses (heavy metals, salinity, drought, and temperature), and antibiotic sensitivity. A total of 16 endophytic fungi were isolated using the culture-dependent approach from different tissue parts of wheat plants. Based upon their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA gene sequencing, 15 out of 16 isolates were selected for further analysis. In the contemporary investigation, a number of the tested endophytes exhibited fairly good 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (ACCD) (0.03±0.011 to 1.43±0.01 μmol α-KB mg                             -1                              protein hr                             -1                             ), indole acetic acid (IAA) (1.125±0.04 to36.12±0.004μgml                             -1                             ), and phosphate solubilizing index (PSI) (2.08±0.03to5.16±0.36) activities. More than 30% isolates gave positive result for siderophore and ammonia tests, whereas all exhibited catalase activity but only 2 (582PDA1 and 582PDA11) produced hydrogen cyanide. Trichoderma strains showed salt, heavy metals, and drought tolerance at high levels and also exhibited resistance to all the tested antibiotics. Strain 582PDA4 was found to be the most temperature (55°C) tolerant isolate. The findings of this study indicated that the microbial endophytes isolated from wheat plants possessing a crucial function to improve plant growth could be utilized as biofertilizers or bioagents to establish a sustainable crop production system.                          © 2019 Farhana Alam Ripa et al.},

However, worldwide, fire and grazing shape tropical grasslands over ecological and evolutionary timescales, and it is curious Madagascar should be a global anomaly. We examined the functional and community ecology of Madagascar's grasslands across 71 communities in the Central Highlands. Combining multivariate abundance models of community composition and clustering of grass functional traits, we identified distinct grass assemblages each shaped by fire or grazing. The fire-maintained assemblage is primarily composed of tall caespitose species with narrow leaves and low bulk density. By contrast, the grazer-maintained assemblage is characterized by mat-forming, high bulk density grasses with wide leaves. Within each assemblage, levels of endemism, diversity and grass ages support these as ancient assemblages. Grazer-dependent grasses can only have co-evolved with a now-extinct megafauna. Ironically, the human introduction of cattle probably introduced a megafaunal substitute facilitating modern day persistence of a grazer-maintained grass assemblage in an otherwise defaunated landscape, where these landscapes now support the livelihoods of millions of people. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Several invasion hypotheses predict a positive association between phylogenetic and functional distinctiveness of aliens and their performance, leading to the idea that distinct aliens compete less with their resident communities. However, synthetic pattern relationships between distinctiveness and alien performance and direct tests of competition as the driving mechanism have not been forthcoming. This is likely because different patterns are observed at different spatial grains, because functional trait and phylogenetic information are often incomplete, and because of the need for competition experiments that measure demographic responses across a variety of alien species that vary in their distinctiveness. We conduct a competitor removal experiment and parameterize matrix population and integral projection models for 14 alien plant species. More novel aliens compete less strongly with co-occurring species in their community, but these results dissipate at a larger spatial grain of investigation. Further, we find that functional traits used in conjunction with phylogeny improve our ability to explain competitive responses. Our investigation shows that competition is an important mechanism underlying the differential success of alien species. © 2020 The Authors.},

	abstract = {When confronted with a parasite or pathogen, hosts can defend themselves by resisting or tolerating the attack. While resistance can be diminished when resources are limited, it is unclear how robust tolerance is to changes in environmental conditions. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of tolerance in a single host population living in a highly variable environment. We manipulated the abundance of an invasive parasitic fly, Philornis downsi, in nests of Galápagos mockingbirds (Mimus parvulus) over four field seasons and measured host fitness in response to parasitism. Mockingbird tolerance to P. downsi varied significantly among years and decreased when rainfall was limited. Video observations indicate that parental provisioning of nestlings appears key to tolerance: in drought years, mockingbirds likely do not have sufficient resources to compensate for the effects of P. downsi. These results indicate that host tolerance is a labile trait and suggest that environmental variation plays a major role in mediating the consequences of host–parasite interactions. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Traditional lengthy procedures for crop improvement including classical breeding and random mutagenesis will not be able to fulfill growing crop demand in near future. Gene targeting technology is a powerful transformative procedure that permits accurate genetic modification in any genome which relies on a variety of molecular editors. Formation of directed DNA cleavage by ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9, followed by restoration via the DNA repair system either by NHEJ (non-homologous end joining) or by HDR (homology directed recombination), provides a useful insight of gene function and trait modification. In this chapter, we have described the four available types of genome editing tools; meganucleases, ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR systems, and discussed their revolutionary applications in precision molecular breeding and functional genomics research of crops. Furthermore, specific challenges in the plant genome editing and prospects were also reviewed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

	abstract = {Organisms have evolved a spectrum of strategies that facilitate survival in the face of adverse environmental conditions. In order to make full use of the unfavorable resources of nature, human beings usually impose selective pressures to breed phenotypic traits that can survive in adverse environments. Animals are frequently under attack by biotic stress, such as bacterial and viral infections, while plants are more often subjected to abiotic stress, including high salinity, drought, and cold. In response to these diverse stresses, animals and plants initiate wide-ranging changes in gene expression by altering regulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional activities. Recent studies have identified a number of key responsive components that promote survival of animals and plants in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Importantly, with recent developments in genome-editing technology based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, manipulation of genetic elements to generate stress-resistant animals and plants has become both feasible and cost-effective. Herein, we review important mechanisms that govern the response of organisms to biotic and abiotic stresses with the aim of applying our understanding to the agriculture and animal husbandry industries. © 2018 Songbo Xie, Min Liu, published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis is a key biological process. However, we know little about whether plants change their photosynthetic strategy when introduced to a new range. We located the most likely source population for the South African beach daisy Arctotheca populifolia introduced to Australia in the 1930s, and ran a common-garden experiment measuring 10 physiological and morphological leaf traits associated with photosynthesis. Based on predictions from theory, and higher rainfall in the introduced range, we hypothesized that introduced plants would have a (i) higher photosynthetic rate, (ii) lower water-use efficiency (WUE) and (iii) higher nitrogen-use efficiency. However, we found that introduced A. populifolia had a lower photosynthetic rate, higher WUE and lower nitrogen-use efficiency than did plants from Arniston, South Africa. Subsequent site visits suggested that plants in Arniston may be able to access moisture on a rocky shelf, while introduced plants grow on sandy beaches where water can quickly dissipate. Our unexpected findings highlight that: (1) it is important to compare introduced species to their source population for an accurate assessment of evolutionary change; (2) rainfall is not always a suitable proxy for water availability and (3) introduced species often undergo evolutionary changes, but without detailed ecological information we may not be able to accurately predict the direction of these changes. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Changing environmental conditions cause changes in the distributions of phenotypic traits in natural populations. However, determining the mechanisms responsible for these changes - and, in particular, the relative contributions of phenotypic plasticity versus evolutionary responses - is difficult. To our knowledge, no study has yet reported evidence that evolutionary change underlies the most widely reported phenotypic response to climate change: the advancement of breeding times. In a wild population of red deer, average parturition date has advanced by nearly 2 weeks in 4 decades. Here, we quantify the contribution of plastic, demographic, and genetic components to this change. In particular, we quantify the role of direct phenotypic plasticity in response to increasing temperatures and the role of changes in the population structure. Importantly, we show that adaptive evolution likely played a role in the shift towards earlier parturition dates. The observed rate of evolution was consistent with a response to selection and was less likely to be due to genetic drift. Our study provides a rare example of observed rates of genetic change being consistent with theoretical predictions, although the consistency would not have been detected with a solely phenotypic analysis. It also provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence of both evolution and phenotypic plasticity contributing to advances in phenology in a changing climate. © 2019 Bonnet et al.

	abstract = {Plant trait diversity is known to influence population yield, but the scale at which this happens remains unknown: divergent individuals might change yields of immediate neighbors (neighbor scale) or of plants across a population (population scale). We use Nicotiana attenuata plants silenced in mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (irMPK4) - with low water-use efficiency (WUE) - to study the scale at which water-use traits alter intraspecific population yields. In the field and glasshouse, we observed overyielding in populations with low percentages of irMPK4 plants, unrelated to water-use phenotypes. Paired-plant experiments excluded the occurrence of overyielding effects at the neighbor scale. Experimentally altering field arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associations by silencing the Sym-pathway gene NaCCaMK did not affect reproductive overyielding, implicating an effect independent of belowground AMF interactions. Additionally, micro-grafting experiments revealed dependence on shoot-expressed MPK4 for N. attenuata to vary its yield per neighbor presence. We find that variation in a single-gene, MPK4, is responsible for population overyielding through a mechanism, independent of irMPK4‘s WUE phenotype, at the aboveground, population scale. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

A diverse community of soil organisms that together comprise a complex food web mediates such ecosystem functions and services. Recent advances have shed light on the key drivers of soil food web structure, but a conceptual integration is lacking. Here, we explore how human-induced changes in plant community composition influence soil food webs. We present a framework describing the mechanistic underpinnings of how shifts in plant litter and root traits and microclimatic variables impact on the diversity, structure, and function of the soil food web. We then illustrate our framework by discussing how shifts in plant communities resulting from land-use change, climatic change, and species invasions affect soil food web structure and functioning. We argue that unravelling the mechanistic links between plant community trait composition and soil food webs is essential to understanding the cascading effects of anthropogenic shifts in plant communities on ecosystem functions and services. © 2018 Kardol P and De Long JR.},

	abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are obligate genetic parasites that propagate in host genomes by replicating in germline nuclei, thereby ensuring transmission to offspring. This selfish replication not only produces deleterious mutations—in extreme cases, TE mobilization induces genotoxic stress that prohibits the production of viable gametes. Host genomes could reduce these fitness effects in two ways: resistance and tolerance. Resistance to TE propagation is enacted by germline-specific small-RNA-mediated silencing pathways, such as the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, and is studied extensively. However, it remains entirely unknown whether host genomes may also evolve tolerance by desensitizing gametogenesis to the harmful effects of TEs. In part, the absence of research on tolerance reflects a lack of opportunity, as small-RNA-mediated silencing evolves rapidly after a new TE invades, thereby masking existing variation in tolerance. We have exploited the recent historical invasion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome by P-element DNA transposons in order to study tolerance of TE activity. In the absence of piRNA-mediated silencing, the genotoxic stress imposed by P-elements disrupts oogenesis and, in extreme cases, leads to atrophied ovaries that completely lack germline cells. By performing quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping on a panel of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that lack piRNA-mediated silencing of P-elements, we uncovered multiple QTL that are associated with differences in tolerance of oogenesis to P-element transposition. We localized the most significant QTL to a small 230-kb euchromatic region, with the logarithm of the odds (LOD) peak occurring in the bruno locus, which codes for a critical and well-studied developmental regulator of oogenesis. Genetic, cytological, and expression analyses suggest that bruno dosage modulates germline stem cell (GSC) loss in the presence of P-element activity. Our observations reveal segregating variation in TE tolerance for the first time, and implicate gametogenic regulators as a source of tolerant variants in natural populations. © 2018 Kelleher et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.},

A global environmental driving mechanism of biodiversity dynamics is thus implied by the strong correlation between temperature proxies and diversity patterns in a wide variety of fauna and flora. Yet climate consists of many interacting variables. Species probably respond to the entire climate system as opposed to its individual facets. Here, we examine ecological and morphological traits of 12 633 individuals of two species of planktonic foraminifera with similar ecologies but contrasting evolutionary outcomes. Our results show that morphological and ecological changes are correlated to the interactions between multiple environmental factors. Models including interactions between climate variables explain at least twice as much variation in size, shape and abundance changes as models assuming that climate parameters operate independently. No dominant climatic driver can be identified: temperature alone explains remarkably little variation through our highly resolved temporal sequences, implying that a multivariate approach is required to understand evolutionary response to abiotic forcing. Our results caution against the use of a 'silver bullet' environmental parameter to represent global climate while studying evolutionary responses to abiotic change, and show that more comprehensive reconstruction of palaeobiological dynamics requires multiple biotic and abiotic dimensions. © 2018 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is a global phenomenon with profound effects on the ecology and evolution of organisms. We examined the relative roles of natural selection, genetic drift and gene flow in influencing the evolution of white clover (Trifolium repens), which thrives in urban and rural areas. Trifolium repens exhibits a Mendelian polymorphism for the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a potent antiherbivore defence. We quantified the relative frequency of HCN in 490 populations sampled along urban-rural transects in 20 cities. We also characterized genetic variation within 120 populations in eight cities using 16 microsatellite loci. HCN frequency increased by 0.6% for every kilometre from an urban centre, and the strength of this relationship did not significantly vary between cities. Populations did not exhibit changes in genetic diversity with increasing urbanization, indicating that genetic drift is unlikely to explain urban-rural clines in HCN frequency. Populations frequently exhibited isolation-by-distance and extensive gene flow along most urban-rural transects, with the exception of a single city that exhibited genetic differentiation between urban and rural populations. Our results show that urbanization repeatedly drives parallel evolution of an ecologically important trait across many cities that vary in size, and this evolution is best explained by urban-rural gradients in natural selection. © 2018 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Plant species diversity affects carbon and nutrient cycling during litter decomposition, yet the generality of the direction of this effect and its magnitude remain uncertain. With a meta-analysis including 65 field studies across the Earth’s major forest ecosystems, we show here that decomposition was faster when litter was composed of more than one species. These positive biodiversity effects were mostly driven by temperate forests, but were more variable in other forests. Litter mixture effects emerged most strongly in early decomposition stages and were related to divergence in litter quality. Litter diversity also accelerated nitrogen, but not phosphorus release, potentially indicating a decoupling of nitrogen and phosphorus cycling and perhaps a shift in ecosystem nutrient limitation with changing biodiversity. Our findings demonstrate the importance of litter diversity effects for carbon and nutrient dynamics during decomposition, and show how these effects vary with litter traits, decomposer complexity and forest characteristics. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

We tested the functional redundancy of novel tree communities by verifying if six pairs of congeneric European and North American tree species bearing similar leaf litter traits resulted in similar ecological filters influencing the assembly of springtail (Collembola) communities at two sites. Litter biogeographic origin (native versus non-native) did not influence springtail community structure, but litter genus, which generally reflected trait differences, did.

	abstract = {Increasing knowledge on the genetic basis of seed germination and seedling heterotrophic growth under abiotic stresses is of major importance for improving crop establishment in the context of climate changes. Among stresses, sub‐ and supra‐optimal temperatures and water deficit, highly compromise these early stages of development and limit crop distribution. The present chapter synthesizes genetic analyses carried out in Medicago truncatula on seed germination and seedling heterotrophic growth under stress conditions, with a focus on low temperatures. A specific attention was paid to hypocotyl growth, as varieties with high potential for upward shoot elongation were required in stressful environments. Traits were characterized at seed, organ, or cellular levels on nested core collections and recombinant inbred line populations (RIL4 and RIL5) considered for the contrasted behaviors of the parental accessions based on an ecophysiological model framework for crop emergence predictions. A first Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis was carried out at sub‐ (5 °C, 10 °C) and supra‐optimal (20 °C) temperatures. At 20 °C, imbibition and germination rates as well as early embryonic axis growth were measured in RIL4 using an automated image capture and analysis device. At low temperatures, seed germination and hypocotyl heterotrophic growth were characterized on RIL5. The phenotypic framework defined for measuring traits allowed distinguishing stages and thus identifying distinct QTLs for seed mass, imbibition, germination, and heterotrophic growth. A common QTL was found for hypocotyl elongation under both low temperature and water deficit. Finally, those QTLs controlling hypocotyl elongation at low temperature due to epidermal cell number pre‐established in the seeds and those due to elongation of these cells, two key determinants of hypocotyl elongation under stress at cellular level, were identified in RIL5. Together with working on a model plant, the QTL approach developed will facilitate the identification of genes specific to each stage. With this aim in view, an initial set of putative candidate genes was highlighted within the support intervals of some QTLs based on the role of hormone balance regulating germination at high temperature, the molecular cascade in response to cold‐stress and hypotheses on changes in cell elongation with changes in temperature based on studies at the whole plant scale. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Although many genomic databases for cereals are available, there is currently no cohesive web resource of manually curated nutrient use efficiency (NtUE)-related genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs). In this study, we present a web-resource containing information on NtUE-related genes/QTLs and the corresponding available microRNAs for some of these genes in four major cereal crops (wheat ( Triticum aestivum), rice ( Oryza sativa), maize ( Zea mays), barley ( Hordeum vulgare)), two alien species related to wheat ( Triticum urartu and Aegilops tauschii), and two model species ( Brachypodium distachyon and Arabidopsis thaliana). Gene annotations integrated in the current web resource were manually curated from the existing databases and the available literature. The primary goal of developing this web resource is to provide descriptions of the NtUE-related genes and their functional annotation. MicroRNAs targeting some of the NtUE related genes and the QTLs for NtUE-related traits are also included.

	abstract = {Selection of the fittest can promote individual competitiveness but often results in the erosion of group performance. Recently, several authors revisited this idea in crop production and proposed new practices based on selection for cooperative phenotypes, i.e. phenotypes that increase crop yield through decreased competitiveness. These recommendations, however, remain difficult to evaluate without a formal description of crop evolutionary dynamics under different selection strategies. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to investigate the evolution of cooperation-related traits in crops, using plant height as a case study. Our model is tailored to realistic agricultural practices and shows that combining high plant density, high relatedness and selection among groups favours the evolution of shorter plants that maximize grain yield. Our model allows us to revisit past and current breeding practices in light of kin selection theory, and yields practical recommendations to increase cooperation among crops and promote sustainable agriculture. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {The Species–Area Relation (SAR), which describes the increase in the number of species S with increasing area A, is under intense scrutiny in contemporary ecology, in particular to probe its reliability in predicting the number of species going extinct as a direct result of habitat loss. Here, we focus on the island SAR, which is measured across a set of disjoint habitat patches, and we argue that the SAR portrays an average trend around which fluctuations are to be expected due to the stochasticity of community dynamics within the patches, external perturbations, and habitat heterogeneity across different patches. This probabilistic interpretation of the SAR, though already implicit in the theory of island biogeography and manifest in the scatter of data points in plots of empirical SAR curves, has not been investigated systematically from the theoretical point of view. Here, we show that the two main contributions to SAR fluctuations, which are due to community dynamics within the patches and to habitat heterogeneity between different patches, can be decoupled and analyzed independently. To investigate the community dynamics contribution to SAR fluctuations, we explore a suite of theoretical models of community dynamics where the number of species S inhabiting a patch emerges from diverse ecological and evolutionary processes, and we compare stationary predictions for the coefficient of variation of S, i.e. the fluctuations of S with respect to the mean. We find that different community dynamics models diverge radically in their predictions. In island biogeography and in neutral frameworks, where fluctuations are only driven by the stochasticity of diversification and extinction events, relative fluctuations decay when the mean increases. Computational evidence suggests that this result is robust in the presence of competition for space or resources. When species compete for finite resources, and mass is introduced as a trait determining species’ birth, death and resource consumption rates based on empirical allometric scalings, relative fluctuations do not decay with increasing mean S due to the occasional introduction of new species with large resource demands causing mass extinctions in the community. Given this observation, we also investigate the contribution of external disturbance events to fluctuations of S in neutral community dynamics models and compare this scenario with the community dynamics in undisturbed non-neutral models. Habitat heterogeneity within a single patch, in the context of metapopulation models, causes variability in the number of coexisting species which proves negligible with respect to that caused by the stochasticity of the community dynamics. The second contribution to SAR fluctuations, which is due to habitat heterogeneity among different patches, introduces corrections to the coefficient of variation of S. Most importantly, inter-patches heterogeneity introduces a constant, lower bound on the relative fluctuations of S equal to the coefficient of variation of a habitat variable describing the heterogeneity among patches. Because heterogeneity across patches is inevitably present in natural ecosystems, we expect that the relative fluctuations of S always tend to a constant in the limit of large mean S or large patch area A, with contributions from community dynamics, inter-patches heterogeneity or both. We provide a theoretical framework for modelling these two contributions and we show that both can affect significantly the fluctuations of the SAR. © 2018 The Authors},

Migration is relative to the size of the individuals. This is an evolutionary outcome according to the status-dependent strategy model, which assumes that the juveniles exhibit the optimal tactic based on their status. In this paper, we consider the case in which the density of adult residents suppresses juvenile growth, and explore the dynamics of alternative tactics and the evolution of threshold size. We show that a fraction of the migratory tactic that might converge into a stable state or continue to fluctuate wildly, and that the evolutionary outcome might be evolutionarily bistable, resulting in a clearly different threshold size. In the case of evolutionary bistability, two threshold sizes differ in ecological dynamics either by stable fraction of migratory tactic or showing two-year periodic fluctuation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Rather than pre-assigning zero-or-one interaction rate, we diversify the rate of interaction by associating it with phenotypes. Individuals each carry a set of potentially expressible traits and expresses a number of such traits at a cost proportional to the number. The set of traits expressed constitutes phenotype. Phenotypes and thus the rate of interaction are evolvable over time. Our results show that nonnegligible cost of expressing traits restrains phenotype diversity, and the evolutionary race mainly proceeds on between cooperative strains and defective strains who express a very few traits. It pays for cooperative strains to express a very few traits. Though such a low level of expression weakens reciprocity between cooperative strains, it decelerates the rate of interaction between cooperative strains and defective strains to a larger degree, leading to the predominance of cooperative strains over defective strains. We also find that evolved diversity of phenotype can occasionally destabilize due to the invasion of defective mutants, implying that cooperation and diversity of phenotype can mutually reinforce each other.

In the African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae quantitative and qualitative variance in CHC composition have been associated with speciation, ecological habitat and insecticide resistance. Understanding how these modifications arise will inform us of how mosquitoes are responding to climate change and vector control interventions. CHCs are synthesised in sub-epidermal cells called oenocytes that are very difficult to isolate from surrounding tissues. Here we utilise a transgenic line with fluorescent oenocytes to purify these cells for the first time.

	abstract = {Ecological and evolutionary dynamics observed in mutualistic communities can be shaped by several mechanisms, including ecological interactions and their co-evolutionary consequences. Here we explore how intra and interspecific competition, together with mutualistic interactions, can affect community assembly through their effects on adaptive diversification and the emergence of biodiversity. To capture both ecological and evolutionary processes simultaneously, we used the adaptive dynamics approach based on a Lotka-Volterra framework and simulated the ecological dynamics of populations as well as the evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic traits. Depending on the initial trait values, two possible alternative evolutionary regimes emerged: traits evolve towards either optimal utilization of environmental resources or maximizing the benefits from mutualistic interactions. Diversification and overall biodiversity are mostly driven by frequency-dependent competition, while mutualism plays an important role in enhancing ecosystem productivity and evolutionary stability. Because different initial trait values in a community can lead to alternative evolutionary regimes, species loss and biological invasions could not only alter ecological dynamics but also push the system onto an alternative successional climax or evolutionary end point. It thus becomes essential to clarify the past evolutionary dynamics so as to draw conclusions on key community assembly processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Merrill) is emerging as one of the fastest-growing oilseed crops in the world containing about 40% protein and 20% oil and is also being used as potential feed for animals. Drought stress being a major abiotic stress factor affects the soybean productivity adversely. Thus, to enhance the productivity of soybean, besides managing the nutrients, stress management is of utmost importance. There is enormous potential for opportunity of application of microbes especially bradyrhizobia either applied alone or co-inoculated with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), and AM fungi can help in nutrient mobilization and confer tolerance to plants by alleviating adverse effects of stresses. Bradyrhizobia are mainly slow-growing, ubiquitous group of soil bacteria known as root symbiont; this is symbiotically associated with roots of soybean plants. In this chapter, we provided on how drought affects the soybean production worldwide and utilized specific bradyrhizobial strains to confer tolerance to soybean plants under drought stress and to understand the mechanisms imparting in the reduction of abiotic stress, e.g., GOGGAT MAPK, different polysaccharides, and other precursors involved in drought stress recovering mechanism. The enhancement of the soybean bradyrhizobial symbiosis participating in the drought tolerance particularly with climate smart bradyrhizobia having high osmotolerant traits, persisting longer in the field, and availability of such inoculants have also been discussed. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

	abstract = {Background. The acquisition of invasive tumor cell behavior is considered to be the cornerstone of the metastasis cascade. Thus, genetic markers associated with invasiveness can be stratified according to patient prognosis. In this study, we aimed to identify an invasive genetic trait and study its biological relevance in lung adenocarcinoma. Methods. 250 TCGA patients with lung adenocarcinoma were used as the training set, and the remaining 250 TCGA patients, 500 ALL TCGA patients, 226 patients with GSE31210, 83 patients with GSE30219, and 127 patients with GSE50081 were used as the verification data sets. Subtype classification of all TCGA lung adenocarcinoma samples was based on invasion-associated genes using the R package ConsensusClusterPlus. Kaplan-Meier curves, LASSO (least absolute contraction and selection operator) method, and univariate and multivariate Cox analysis were used to develop a molecular model for predicting survival. Results. As a consequence, two molecular subtypes for LUAD were first identified from all TCGA all data sets which were significant on survival time. C1 subtype with poor prognosis has higher clinical characteristics of malignancy, higher mutation frequency of KRAS and TP53, and a lower expression of immune regulatory molecules. 2463 differentially expressed invasion genes between C1 and C2 subtypes were obtained, including 580 upregulation genes and 1883 downregulation genes. Functional enrichment analysis found that upregulated genes were associated with the development of tumor pathways, while downregulated genes were more associated with immunity. Furthermore, 5-invasion gene signature was constructed based on 2463 genes, which was validated in four data sets. This signature divided patients into high-risk and low-risk groups, and the LUDA survival rate of the high-risk group is significantly lower than that of the low-risk group. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that this gene signature was an independent prognostic factor for LUDA. Compared with other existing models, our model has a higher AUC. Conclusion. In this study, two subtypes were identified. In addition, we developed a 5-gene signature prognostic risk model, which has a good AUC in the training set and independent validation set and is a model with independent clinical characteristics. Therefore, we recommend using this classifier as a molecular diagnostic test to assess the prognostic risk of patients with LUDA.  © 2020 Zhimin Zheng et al.},

	abstract = {Within the twilight of the oceanic mesopelagic realm, 200–1000 m below sea level, are potentially vast resources of fish. Collectively, these mesopelagic fishes are the most abundant vertebrates on Earth, and this global fish community plays a vital role in the function of oceanic ecosystems. The biomass of these fishes has recently been estimated using acoustic survey methods, which rely on echosounder-generated signals being reflected from gas-filled swimbladders and detected by transducers on vessels. Here, we use X-ray computed tomography scans to demonstrate that several of the most abundant species of mesopelagic fish in the Southern Ocean lack gas-filled swimbladders. We also show using catch data from survey trawls that the fish community switches from fish possessing gas-filled swimbladders to those lacking swimbladders as latitude increases towards the Antarctic continent. Thus, the acoustic surveys that repeatedly show a decrease in mesopelagic fish biomass towards polar environments systematically overlook a large proportion of fish species that dominate polar seas. Importantly, this includes lanternfish species that are key prey items for top predators in the region, including king penguins and elephant seals. This latitudinal community switch, from gas to non-gas dominance, has considerable implications for acoustic biomass estimation, ecosystem modelling and long-term monitoring of species at risk from climate change and potential exploitation. ©2019 The Authors.},

This research is motivated by theories that assume that the suite of traits that characterize a species’ form determines its function, that these traits have become fixed over evolutionary time, and that ensuing ecosystem process are not resilient to environmental change. Here, I explore new research that re-evaluates this theory. Recent results suggest that functional traits are malleable, enabling species to rapidly respond and adapt to each other as environmental conditions change with predictable effects on ecosystem processes. These basic research findings suggest that species adaptations may impart in ecosystems an inherent capacity to weather environmental changes, thereby offering deeper understanding about which biological attributes protect ecological functions and which are needed to restore damaged ecosystems. © 2018 Oswald J.

	abstract = {Among legume crops, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., 2n = 4x = 32) is considered the most widely grown forage legume for feeding ruminant animals because of its productivity and high nutritional value. Barrel medic (Medicago truncatula Gaertn., 2n = 2x = 16), a close relative of alfalfa, represents a valuable model system for legume genomic and genetics studies in view of its relatively small diploid genome, autogamous reproduction and relatively short generation time. During the last two to three decades, genetic engineering methods have been successfully established to transform both forage legume species. Use of transformation of M. truncatula offers the opportunity for defining gene function and comparative assessment to other legume species, while alfalfa transformation approaches mainly focused on tolerance to herbicide, tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, forage quality and yield, and molecular farming. However, the application of biotechnological techniques has been limited to a few highly regenerable genotypes with a modest agronomic and commercial value. Furthermore, the development of genetically modified (GM) crops and their commercialization exploitation are associated with several biosafety and regulatory issues and public concerns, which have limited the development of transgenic traits. New molecular approaches have been designed to address and overcome these issues. This chapter summarizes the current promising genetic engineering techniques (marker‐free, cisgenesis/intragenesis, and genome editing) focusing on M. sativa and M. truncatula recent achievements. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {Animals can have both positive (e.g. via seed dispersal) and negative (e.g. via herbivory) impacts on plants. The net effects of these interactions remain difficult to predict and may be affected by overhunting and habitat disturbance, two widespread threats to tropical forests. Recent studies have documented their separate effects on plant recruitment but our understanding of how defaunation and logging interact to influence tropical tree communities is limited. From 2013 to 2016, we followed the fate of marked tree seedlings (n = 1489) from 81 genera in and outside experimental plots. Our plots differentially excluded small, medium and large-bodied mammal herbivores in logged and unlogged forest in Malaysian Borneo. We assessed the effects of experimental defaunation and logging on taxonomic diversity and plant trait (wood density, specific leaf area, fruit size) composition of seedling communities. Although seedling mortality was highest in the presence of all mammal herbivores (44%), defaunation alone did not alter taxonomic diversity nor plant trait composition. However, herbivores (across all body sizes) significantly reduced mean fruit size across the seedling community over time (95% confidence interval (CI): 20.09 to 20.01), particularly in logged forest (95% CI: 20.12 to 20.003). Our findings suggest that impacts of mammal herbivores on plant communities may be greater in forests with a history of disturbance and could subsequently affect plant functional traits and ecological processes associated with forest regeneration. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Humans commonly harvest animals based on their expression of secondary sexual traits such as horns or antlers. This selective harvest is thought to have little effect on harvested populations because offtake rates are low and usually only the males are targeted. These arguments do not, however, take the relationship between secondary sexual trait expression and animal condition into account: there is increasing evidence that in many cases the degree of expression of such traits is correlated with an animal’s overall well-being, which is partly determined by their genetic match to the environment. Using an individual-based model,we find that when there is directional environmental change, selective harvest of males with the largest secondary sexual traits can lead to extinction in otherwise resilient populations. When harvest is not selective, the males best suited to a new environment gain the majority of matings and beneficial alleles spread rapidly. When these bestadapted males are removed, however, their beneficial alleles are lost, leading to extinction. Given the current changes happening globally, these results suggest that trophy hunting and other cases of selective harvest (such as certain types of insect collection) should be managed with extreme care whenever populations are faced with changing conditions. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {An understanding of the balance of interspecific competition and the physical environment in structuring organismal communities is crucial because those communities structured primarily by their physical environment typically exhibit greater sensitivity to environmental change than those structured predominantly by competitive interactions. Here, using detailed phylogenetic and functional information, we investigate this question in macrofaunal assemblages from Northwest Atlantic Ocean continental slopes, a high seas region projected to experience substantial environmental change through the current century. We demonstrate assemblages to be both phylogenetically and functionally under-dispersed, and thus conclude that the physical environment, not competition, may dominate in structuring deep-ocean communities. Further, we find temperature and bottom trawling intensity to be among the environmental factors significantly related to assemblage diversity. These results hint that deep-ocean communities are highly sensitive to their physical environment and vulnerable to environmental perturbation, including by direct disturbance through fishing, and indirectly through the changes brought about by climate change. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Comparative analyses of ectotherm susceptibility to climate change often focus on thermal extremes, yet responses to aridity may be equally important. Here we focus on plasticity in desiccation resistance, a key trait shaping distributions of Drosophila species and other small ectotherms. We examined the extent to which 32 Drosophila species, varying in their distribution, could increase their desiccation resistance via phenotypic plasticity involving hardening, linking these responses to environment, phylogeny and basal resistance. We found no evidence to support the seasonality hypothesis; species with higher hardening plasticity did not occupy environments with higher and more seasonal precipitation. As basal resistance increased, the capacity of species to respond via phenotypic plasticity decreased, suggesting plastic responses involving hardening may be constrained by basal resistance. Trade-offs between basal desiccation resistance and plasticity were not universal across the phylogeny and tended to occur within specific clades. Phylogeny, environment and trade-offs all helped to explain variation in plasticity for desiccation resistance but in complex ways. These findings suggest some species have the ability to counter dry periods through plastic responses, whereas others do not; and this ability will depend to some extent on a species placement within a phylogeny, along with its basal level of resistance. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

In particular, few studies have focused on the dynamics resulting from the co-occurrence of mutualistic and competitive interactions within a group of species. Here we build a mathematical model to study the dynamics of a guild of competitors who are also engaged in mutualistic interactions with a common partner. We show that coexistence as well as competitive exclusion can occur depending on the competition strength and on strength of the mutualistic interactions, and we formulate concrete criteria for predicting invasion success of an alien mutualist based on propagule pressure, alien traits (such as its resource exchange ability) and composition of the recipient community. We find that intra guild diversity promotes the coexistence of species that would otherwise competitively exclude each other, and makes a guild less vulnerable to invasion. Our results can serve as a useful framework to predict the consequences of species manipulation in mutualistic communities. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

Using experimental data from Daphnia magna and a microsporidian parasite, we fitted a mechanistic model of the within-host parasite population dynamics. Model parameters comprising host aging and mortality, as well as parasite growth, virulence, and equilibrium abundance, were specified by relationships arising from the metabolic theory of ecology. The model effectively predicts host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature while using less than half the parameters compared to modeling temperatures discretely. Our results serve as a proof of concept that linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host–parasite framework can be used to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. © 2018 Kirk et al.},

	abstract = {The spread of an invasive species often results in a decline and subsequent disappearance of native competitors. Several models, primarily based on spatially explicit Lotka–Volterra competition dynamics, have been developed to understand this phenomenon. In general, the goal of these models is to relate fundamental life history traits, for example dispersal ability and competition strength, to the rate of spread of the invasive species, which is also the rate at which the invasive species displaces its native competitor. Stage-structure is often an important determinant of population dynamics, but it has received little attention within the context of Lotka–Volterra invasion models. For many species, behaviors like dispersal and competition depend on life-stage. To describe the processes of invasion in these species, it is important to understand how behaviors that vary as a function of life-stage can impact spread rate. In this paper, we develop a spatially explicit, stage-structured Lotka–Volterra competition model. By comparing spread speed predictions from this model to spread speed predictions from an analogous single-stage model, we are able to determine when stage-structure is important and how stage-dependent behavior can alter the characteristics of an invasion. © 2017},

	abstract = {As climate changes endlessly, it becomes more important to understand possible reactions from soils to the climate system. It is a known fact that microorganisms, which are associated with plant, may stimulate plant growth and enhance resistance to disease and abiotic stresses. The effects of climate change factors, such as elevated CO2, drought, and temperature on beneficial plant-microorganism interactions are increasingly being explored. Organisms live in concert with thousands of other species, such as some beneficial and pathogenic species which have little to no effect on complex communities. Since natural communities are composed of organisms with very different life history traits and dispersal ability, it is unlikely that all of the microbial community will respond to climatic change factors in a similar way. Among the different factors related to climate change, elevated CO2 had a positive influence on the abundance of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas the effects on plant-growth-promoting bacteria and endophytic fungi were more variable. The rise in temperature effects on beneficial plant-associated microorganisms were more variable, positive, neutral, and negative, which were equally common and varied considerably with the temperature range. Likewise, plant-growth-promoting microorganisms (i.e., bacteria and fungi) positively affected plants subjected to drought stress. In this chapter, we explore how climatic change affects soil microbes and plant-associated microorganisms. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Recent studies in theoretical evolutionary ecology have emphasised two approaches to modelling evolution. On the one hand, models based on a separation of time scales rely on the concept of invasion fitness. On the other hand, models based on the Price equation track the dynamics of a trait average, coupled with a description of ecological dynamics. The aim of this article is to show that, in class-structured populations, both approaches yield the same expression for the selection gradient under weak selection. Although the result is not new, I propose an alternative route to its derivation using the dynamics of scaled measures of between-class phenotypic differentiation. Under weak selection, these measures of phenotypic differentiation can be treated as fast variables compared to the trait mean, which allows for a quasi-equilibrium approximation. This suggests a different approach to calculating weak selection approximations of evolutionary dynamics, and clarifies the links between short- and long-term perspectives on evolution in structured populations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Characterizing functional trait variation and covariation, and its drivers, is critical to understand the response of species to changing environmental conditions. Evolutionary and environmental factors determine how traits vary among and within species at multiple scales. However, disentangling their relative contribution is challenging and a comprehensive trait-environment framework addressing such questions is missing in lichens. We investigated the variation in nine traits related to photosynthetic performance, water use and nutrient acquisition applying phylogenetic comparative analyses in lichen epiphytic communities on beech across Europe. These poikilohydric organisms offer a valuable model owing to their inherent limitations to buffer contrasting environmental conditions. Photobiont type and growth form captured differences in certain physiological traits whose variation was largely determined by evolutionary processes (i.e. phylogenetic history), although the intraspecific component was non-negligible. Seasonal temperature fluctuations also had an impact on trait variation, while nitrogen content depended on photobiont type rather than nitrogen deposition. The inconsistency of trait covariation among and within species prevented establishing major resource use strategies in lichens. However, we did identify a general pattern related to the water-use strategy. Thus, to robustly unveil lichen responses under different climatic scenarios, it is necessary to incorporate both among and within-species trait variation and covariation. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Overall, the sensitivity of the species to toxic compounds is in the range with, or higher than, that of other model species. This work describes protocols for acute, chronic, and multigenerational bioassays of single and combined stressor effects on N. furzeri. Due to its short maturation time and life-cycle, this vertebrate model allows the study of endpoints such as maturation time and fecundity within four months. Transgenerational full life-cycle exposure trials can be performed in as little as 8 months. Since this species produces eggs that are drought-resistant and remain viable for years, the on-site culture of the species is not needed but individuals can be recruited when required. The protocols are designed to measure life-history traits (mortality, growth, fecundity, weight) and critical thermal maximum. © 2018 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

	abstract = {Chemical contaminants (e.g. metals, pesticides, pharmaceuticals) are changing ecosystems via effects on wildlife. Indeed, recent work explicitly performed under environmentally realistic conditions reveals that chemical contaminants can have both direct and indirect effects at multiple levels of organization by influencing animal behaviour. Altered behaviour reflects multiple physiological changes and links individual- to population-level processes, thereby representing a sensitive tool for holistically assessing impacts of environmentally relevant contaminant concentrations. Here, we show that even if direct effects of contaminants on behavioural responses are reasonably well documented, there are significant knowledge gaps in understanding both the plasticity (i.e. individual variation) and evolution of contaminant-induced behavioural changes. We explore implications of multi-level processes by developing a conceptual framework that integrates direct and indirect effects on behaviour under environmentally realistic contexts. Our framework illustrates how sublethal behavioural effects of contaminants can be both negative and positive, varying dynamically within the same individuals and populations. This is because linkages within communities will act indirectly to alter and even magnify contaminant-induced effects. Given the increasing pressure on wildlife and ecosystems from chemical pollution, we argue there is a need to incorporate existing knowledge in ecology and evolution to improve ecological hazard and risk assessments. © 2019 The Authors.},

Species find themselves in novel environments, within communities assembled from never before encountered mixtures of invasives and natives. The speed with which the biotic and abiotic environment of species has changed has already altered the evolutionary trajectory of species, a trend that promises to escalate. In this article, I reflect upon this altered course of evolution. Human activities have reshaped selection pressures, favouring individuals that better survive in our built landscapes, that avoid our hunting and fishing, and that best tolerate the species that we have introduced. Human-altered selection pressures have also modified how organisms live and move through the landscape, and even the nature of reproduction and genome structure. Humans are also shaping selection pressures at the species level, and I discuss how species traits are affecting both extinction and speciation rates in the Anthropocene. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This study uses fossils from the major Southern Hemisphere family Proteaceae to test whether stomatal cell size responded to Cenozoic climate change. We measured the length and abundance of guard cells (the cells forming stomata), the area of epidermal pavement cells, stomatal index and maximum stomatal conductance from a comprehensive sample of fossil cuticles of Proteaceae, and extracted published estimates of past temperature and atmospheric CO2. We developed a novel test based on stochastic modelling of trait evolution to test correlations among traits. Guard cell length increased, and stomatal density decreased significantly with decreasing palaeotemperature. However, contrary to expectations, stomata tended to be smaller and more densely packed at higher atmospheric CO2. Thus, associations between stomatal traits and palaeoclimate over the last 70 million years in Proteaceae suggest that stomatal size is significantly affected by environmental factors other than atmospheric CO2. Guard cell length, pavement cell area, stomatal density and stomatal index covaried in ways consistent with coordinated development of leaf tissues. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Heat stress as a yield limiting issue has become a major threat for food security as global warming progresses. Being sessile, plants cannot avoid heat stress. They respond to heat stress by activating complex molecular networks, such as signal transduction, metabolite production and expressions of heat stress-associated genes. Some plants have developed an intricate signalling network to respond and adapt it. Heat stress tolerance is a polygenic trait, which is regulated by various genes, transcriptional factors, proteins and hormones. Therefore, to improve heat stress tolerance, a sound knowledge of various mechanisms involved in the response to heat stress is required. The classical breeding methods employed to enhance heat stress tolerance has had limited success. In this era of genomics, next generation sequencing techniques, availability of genome sequences and advanced biotechnological tools open several windows of opportunities to improve heat stress tolerance in crop plants. This review discusses the potential of various functional genomic approaches, such as genome wide association studies, microarray, and suppression subtractive hybridization, in the process of discovering novel genes related to heat stress, and their functional validation using both reverse and forward genetic approaches. This review also discusses how these functionally validated genes can be used to improve heat stress tolerance through plant breeding, transgenics and genome editing approaches. © 2019 Singh B et al.},

	abstract = {Increased ocean temperatures are causing mass bleaching of anemones and corals in the tropics worldwide. While such heat-induced loss of algal symbionts (zooxanthellae) directly affects anemones and corals physiologically, this damage may also cascade on to other animal symbionts. Metabolic rate is an integrative physiological trait shown to relate to various aspects of organismal performance, behaviour and locomotor capacity, and also shows plasticity during exposure to acute and chronic stressors. As climate warming is expected to affect the physiology, behaviour and life history of animals, including ectotherms such as fish, we measured if residing in bleached versus unbleached sea anemones (Heteractis magnifica) affected the standard (i.e. baseline) metabolic rate and behaviour (activity) of juvenile orange-fin anemonefish (Amphiprion chrysopterus). Metabolic rate was estimated from rates of oxygen uptake (ṀO2), and the standard metabolic rate (ṀO2min) of anemonefish from bleached anemones was significantly higher by 8.2% compared with that of fish residing in unbleached anemones, possibly due to increased stress levels. Activity levels did not differ between fish from bleached and unbleached anemones. As ṀO2min reflects the minimum cost of living, the increased metabolic demands may contribute to the negative impacts of bleaching on important anemonefish life history and fitness traits observed previously (e.g. reduced spawning frequency and lower fecundity). © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Concomitant to the decline of tropical corals caused by increasing global sea temperatures is the potential removal of barriers to species range expansions into subtropical and temperate habitats. In these habitats, species must tolerate lower annual mean temperature, wider annual temperature ranges and lower minimum temperatures. To understand ecophysiological traits that will impact geographical range boundaries, we monitored populations of five coral species within a marginal habitat and used a year of in situ measures to model thermal performance of vital host, symbiont and holobiont physiology. Metabolic responses to temperature revealed two acclimatization strategies: peak productivity occurring at annual midpoint temperatures (4 - 68C lower than tropical counterparts), or at annual maxima. Modelled relationships between temperature and P:R were compared to a year of daily subtropical sea temperatures and revealed that the relatively short time spent at any one temperature, limited optimal performance of all strategies to approximately half the days of the year. Thus, while subtropical corals can adjust their physiology to persist through seasonal lows, seasonal variation seems to be the key factor limiting coral productivity. This constraint on rapid reef accretion within subtropical environments provides insight into the global distribution of future coral reefs and their ecosystem services. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In this scenario we adapted a strategic approach for screening of elite chilli genotypes, by exploring role of seed antioxidants in stress tolerance during vegetative phase. A total of 20 chilli genotypes' seed antioxidant potential and its effect on water stress tolerance were studied at three water regimes, namely, control (100% Field Capacity), moderate (80% Field Capacity), and severe (60% Field Capacity) stress conditions. Drought tolerance traits relative water content, chlorophyll content, and activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes were measured. A strong correlation was observed between seed antioxidants and water stress tolerant traits in seedlings. Genotypes KCa-5, KCa-6, and KCa-10 showed low quantity of H2O2 and Malondialdehyde in seeds and maintained high membrane integrity and chlorophyll content in seedlings. High content of proline in KCa-5, KCa-7, and KCa-10 seeds retained high relative water content at seedling stage under severe water stress. Present work reveals genotypic differences of hot pepper to different water regimes. Based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of seed antioxidant variables and drought tolerance indices twenty genotypes segregated into three clusters, namely, drought tolerant and susceptible and moderately tolerant. © 2018 U.

	abstract = {Generalist predators with broadly overlapping niches commonly coexist on seemingly identical sets of prey. Here, we provide empirical demonstration that predators can differentially exploit fine-grained niches generated by variable, heritable and selective defences within a single prey species. Some, but not all, clones of the aphid Aphis craccivora are toxic towards the dominant invasive predatory ladybeetle, Harmonia axyridis. However, other less competitive ladybeetle species are not affected by the aphid’s toxic trait. In laboratory and open field experiments, we show: (i) that subdominant ladybeetle species were able to exploit the toxic aphids, benefitting from the suppression of the dominant predator; and (ii) that this narrow-spectrum toxicity can function as an anti-predator defence for the aphid, but depends on enemy community context. Our results demonstrate that niche differentiation among generalist predators may hinge upon previously underappreciated heritable variation in prey defence, which, in turn, may promote diversity and stability of enemy communities invaded by a dominant predator. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {We analyzed variations in 90 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene sequences from four populations of domesticated helmeted Guinea fowls (70 individuals) and 1 population of wild helmeted Guinea fowls (20 individuals) in Kenya in order to get information about their origin, genetic diversity, and traits associated with heat stress. 90 sequences were assigned to 25 distinct mtDNA and 4 HSP70 haplotypes. Most mtDNA haplotypes of the domesticated helmeted Guinea fowls were grouped into two main haplogroups, HgA and HgB. The wild population grouped into distinct mtDNA haplogroups. Two mtDNA haplotypes dominated across all populations of domesticated helmeted Guinea fowls: Hap2 and Hap4, while the dominant HSP70 haplotype found in all populations was CGC. Higher haplotype diversities were generally observed. The HSP70 haplotype diversities were low across all populations. The nucleotide diversity values for both mtDNA and HSP70 were generally low. Most mtDNA genetic variations occurred among populations for the three hierarchical categories considered while most variations in the HSP70 gene occurred among individuals within population. The lack of population structure among the domestic populations could suggest intensive genetic intermixing. The differentiation of the wild population may be due to a clearly distinct demographic history that shaped its genetic profile. Analysis of the Kenyan Guinea fowl population structure and history based on mtDNA D-loop variations and HSP70 gene functional polymorphisms complimented by archaeological and linguistic insight supports the hypothesis that most domesticated helmeted Guinea fowls in Kenya are related to the West African domesticated helmeted Guinea fowls. We recommend more molecular studies on this emerging poultry species with potential for poverty alleviation and food security against a backdrop of climate change in Africa. © 2018 Philip Murunga et al.},

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that spatial structure in a population has some, and occasionally great, impacts on ecological and evolutionary dynamics. However, it has been observed that in the homogeneous Wright's island model with a certain standard demographic assumption, spatial structure does not affect the fitness gradient of a fecundity-affecting trait. The location and convergence stability of singular strategies thus remain unchanged. Furthermore, evolutionary branching is impossible for small dispersal rates, and for a wide class of fecundity functions, evolutionary branching is impossible for any dispersal rate if branching does not occur in the corresponding well-mixed model. Spatially homogeneous structure thus often inhibits evolutionary branching. Here we study the impact of spatial heterogeneity on evolutionary dynamics. We consider an infinite Wright's island model, where different islands have different capacity and fecundity consequences, and therefore the population is spatially heterogeneous. Through the analysis of metapopulation fitness, we derive its first-order and second-order derivatives with respect to mutant's trait, which are explicitly represented in terms of fecundity derivatives. The selection gradient turns out to be a biased average of local selection pressures in different patch types. We find that evolutionary branching is generally favored in the presence of spatial heterogeneity. We also find a simple condition under which evolutionary branching is particularly favored. Applications to public-goods cooperation and emergent evolutionary branching to cooperators and defectors are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Body size is a key functional trait that is predicted to decline under warming. Warming is known to cause size declines via phenotypic plasticity, but evolutionary responses of body size to warming are poorly understood. To test for warming-induced evolutionary responses of body size and growth rates, we used populations of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) recently established (less than 100 years) from a common source across a strong thermal gradient (19-33°C) created by geothermal springs. Each spring is remarkably stable in temperature and is virtually closed to gene flow from other thermal environments. Field surveys show that with increasing site temperature, body size distributions become smaller and the reproductive advantage of larger body size decreases. After common rearing to reveal recently evolved trait differences, warmer-source populations expressed slowed juvenile growth rates and increased reproductive effort at small sizes. These results are consistent with an adaptive basis of the plastic temperature-size rule, and they suggest that temperature itself can drive the evolution of countergradient variation in growth rates. The rapid evolution of reduced juvenile growth rates and greater reproduction at a small size should contribute to substantial body downsizing in populations, with implications for population dynamics and for ecosystems in a warming world. © 2020 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Objective(s): The primary cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs like idarubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent, are not limited to neoplastic cells; they also produce similar effects in normal cells. In this study, we hypothesized that the combination of idarubicin-bromelain could make cancer cells more susceptible to cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Materials and Methods: To test our hypothesis, the optimal concentrations of idarubicin and bromelain were combined and incubated in the HL-60 cancer cell line and normal human mononuclear leukocytes (PBMC) for 24, 48, and 72 hr. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated by measurement of ATP cell viability test, DNA damage, Caspase-3, Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB), and DAPI fluorescent dyes in both cell types. Results: The combination of idarubicin-bromelain significantly reduced cell proliferation in the more potent HL-60 compared to PBMC in all incubation times (P<0.05). DNA damage and Caspase-3 levels (except for 24 hr) were also higher in the HL-60 cell line in comparison with PBMC and were statistically significant (P<0.05). The percentages of apoptotic images obtained by DAPI and AO / EB morphological examination were increased in both cells, depending on the combination dose. Conclusion: Based on these results, it can be concluded that idarubicin combined with bromelain produces more cytotoxic effects in low concentrations in comparison with when it was used per se in the HL-60 cells. Conversely, it was found that this combination in PBMC caused less cytotoxicity and less genotoxicity. Taken together, it can be said that this new combination makes cancer cells more sensitive to conventional therapy. © 2019 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {                             Feralisation is a complex process that occurs when a domestic population is returned to the wild. It impacts species invasion biology, speciation, conservation and hybridisation and can be thought of as the reverse of domestication. Domestication has been an area of intense interest and study ever since Darwin, and useful as a model for evolution and the effects of strong directional selection. Despite domestication being used to identify genes affecting a large number of traits that change with selection, little is known about the genomic changes associated with feralisation. Much of the current work on the genetics of feralisation has focused on the detection of early hybrids (F                             1                              or F                             2                             ) between wild and domestic populations. Feralisation can lead to large changes in morphology, behaviour and many other traits, with the process of feralisation involving the sudden return of both natural and sexual selection. Such evolutionary forces influence predatory, foraging and mate choice decisions and exert strong effects on once domesticated, now feral, individuals. As such, feralisation provides a unique opportunity to observe the genomic and phenotypic responses to selection from a known (domesticated) standpoint and identify the genes underlying these selective targets. In this review, we summarise what is known in particular regarding the genomics of feralisation, and also the changes that feralisation has induced on brain size and behaviour.                          © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

Nevertheless, the heritability of thermal traits, which sets a limit on evolutionary potential, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we captured brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) from two populations that occur in contrasting thermal environments. We raised offspring from these populations in a laboratory common garden and compared the shape of their thermal performance curves to test for genetic divergence in thermal physiology. Thermal performance curves differed between populations in a common garden in ways partially consistent with divergent patterns of natural selection experienced by the source populations, implying that they had evolved in response to selection. Next, we estimated the heritability of thermal performance curves and of several traits related to thermoregulatory behaviour. We did not detect significant heritability in most components of the thermal performance curve or in several aspects of thermoregulatory behaviour, suggesting that contemporary selection is unlikely to result in rapid evolution. Our results indicate that the response to selection may be slow in the brown anole and that evolutionary change is unlikely to keep pace with current rates of environmental change. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Species interactions are central in predicting the impairment of biodiversity with climate change. Trophic interactions may be altered through climatedependent changes in either predator food preferences or prey communities. Yet, climate change impacts on predator diet remain surprisingly poorly understood. We experimentally studied the consequences of 2°C warmer climatic conditions on the trophic niche of a generalist lizard predator. We used a system of semi-natural mesocosms housing a variety of invertebrate species and in which climatic conditions were manipulated. Lizards in warmer climatic conditions ate at a greater predatory to phytophagous invertebrate ratio and had smaller individual dietary breadths. These shifts mainly arose from direct impacts of climate on lizard diets rather than from changes in prey communities. Dietary changes were associated with negative changes in fitness-related traits (body condition, gut microbiota) and survival. We demonstrate that climate change alters trophic interactions through top-predator dietary shifts, which might disrupt eco-evolutionary dynamics. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Coping with temporal variation in fire requires plants to have plasticity in traits that promote persistence, but how plastic responses to current conditions are affected by past fire exposure remains unknown. We investigate phenotypic divergence between populations of four resprouting grasses exposed to differing experimental fire regimes (annually burnt or unburnt for greater than 35 years) and test whether divergence persists after plants are grown in a common environment for 1 year. Traits relating to flowering and biomass allocation were measured before plants were experimentally burnt, and their regrowth was tracked. Genetic differentiation between populations was investigated for a subset of individuals. Historic fire frequency influenced traits relating to flowering and below-ground investment. Previously burnt plants produced more inflorescences and invested proportionally more biomass below ground, suggesting a greater capacity for recruitment and resprouting than unburnt individuals. Tiller-scale regrowth rate did not differ between treatments, but prior fire exposure enhanced total regrown biomass in two species. We found no consistent genetic differences between populations suggesting trait differences arose from developmental plasticity. Grass development is influenced by prior fire exposure, independent of current environmental conditions. This priming response to fire, resulting in adaptive trait changes, may produce communities more resistant to future fire regime changes. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Phenotypic variability is increasingly assessed through functional response and effect traits, which provide a mechanistic framework for investigating how an organism responds to varying ecological factors and how these responses affect ecosystem functioning. Covariation between response and effect traits has been poorly examined at the intraspecific level, thus hampering progress in understanding how phenotypic variability alters the role of organisms in ecosystems. Using a multi-trait approach and a nine-month longitudinal monitoring of individual red-swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), we demonstrated that most of the measured response and effect traits were partially stable during the ontogeny of individuals. Suites of response and effect traits were associated with a response syndrome and an effect syndrome, respectively, which were correlated to form a functional syndrome. Using a bioenergetic model, we predicted that differences in the response syndrome composition of hypothetical populations had important ecological effects on a key ecosystem process (i.e. whole-lake litter decomposition) to a level similar to those induced by doubling population size. Demonstrating the existence of a functional syndrome is likely to improve our understanding of the ecological impacts of phenotypic variation among individuals in wild populations across levels of biological organization, and the linkage between ecosystem and evolutionary ecology. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {While many in-laboratory ecotoxicological studies have shown the adverse impact of pollutants to the fitness of an individual, direct evidence from the field on the population dynamics of wildlife animals has been lacking. Here, we provide empirical support for a negative effect of pollution on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) population dynamics in coastal waters of Norway by combining unique time series of juvenile cod abundance, body size, environmental concentration of toxic contaminants and a spatially structured population dynamics model. The study shows that mercury concentration might have decreased the reproductive potential of cod in the region despite the general decline in the environmental concentration of mercury, cadmium and hexachlorobenzene since the implementation of national environmental laws. However, some cod populations appeared to be more resistant to mercury pollution than others, and the strength and shape of mercury effect on cod reproductive potential was fjord-specific. Additionally, cod growth rate changed at scales smaller than fjords with a gradient related to the exposure to the open ocean and offshore cod. These spatial differences in life-history traits emphasize the importance of local adaptation in shaping the dynamics of local wildlife populations. Finally, this study highlights the possibility to mitigate pollution effects on natural populations by reducing the overall pollution level, but also reveals that pollution reduction alone is not enough to rebuild local cod populations. Cod population recovery probably requires complementary efforts on fishing regulation and habitat restoration. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is a primary occupation and has been more intensified to feed the growing population, which has resulted in adverse effects on different production components, especially soil health. Soil is the substratum required to support the plants grow and ultimately human life; for sustainable agriculture it is necessary to have a holistic soil management system in order to maintain soil health and fertility. Activity of agriculturally important microbes in the soil is a parameter of soil quality, fertility and productivity. The distribution and diversity of microbes in the soil are of great significance. It is a well-established fact that beneficial microorganisms mineralize plant nutrients, fix atmospheric nitrogen, stimulate plant growth and also protect plants from various diseases and abiotic stresses. Soil microbial communities are an integral part of soil the ecosystem which is essential to sustain soil fertility and health. Changing climatic conditions by and large affected the soil microbial communities and their interaction with crop plants. Since soil communities have a high diversity, the responses to climate change will be variable; some may adapt rapidly while others may be slow in adaptation, and some may adversity affected. Thus climate change will affect the function of microbial communities as a whole. The situation is further complicated by indiscriminate use of agri-pesticides and plant nutrients that have a high salt index. An organic agricultural production system has a constructive effect on soil microbial biomass, and in the recent past organic farming has gained recognition worldwide. The main aim of organic farming is to avoid the use of chemicals, i.e. synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. This type of farming is characterized by a well-designed cropping system with inclusion of legumes as one of the major crops, dependence on organic inputs like manure and composts with special emphasis on crop rotation, use of bio-fertilizers, deep summer ploughing for pest and weed control, etc. Production in organic farming relies on available nutrients to the plants by mineralization processes through soil microbes. Despite the well-established role of agriculturally important soil microbes, only limited attention is paid towards diversity of the microbial population. Naturally occurring soil microbial communities are multifarious and are associated with organisms having different life history traits, thermal tolerance and dissemination ability. Practicing agriculture in such a way so as to cause minimum damage to the environment is being advocated on a large scale world-wide, i.e. conservation agriculture. Conservation tillage, the most important aspect of conservation agriculture, is a deliberate effort to take care of the soil health and the environment. Climate change indicators like elevated CO2, flood, drought, temperature fluctuations, etc. agitate the distribution and interactions among microorganisms. In the changing climate and resource fatigue scenario, organic farming and conservation agriculture approaches endorse the potential for creating a healthy soil environment by conserving natural flora and maintaining microbial ecosystems, thus paving the way for sustainable agricultural production systems. Research efforts aim at improving a sustainable and healthy agricultural production through the appropriate management of soil microorganisms. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.},

The goal of the current work was to analyze the drought response of Medicago truncatula by characterizing its root nodule proteome. A split‐root system (SRS) was employed, which allows the specific discrimination between local and systemic regulatory mechanisms. Partial drought conditions applied to a SRS resulted in local downregulation of the entire proteome of drought‐stressed nodules. Downregulation of diverse protein functional groups identified mainly proteins related to the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. We suggest lipoxygenases (LOX) and protein regulation as newly recognized players in SNF regulation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2020 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Temperature is a strong driver of vector-borne disease transmission. Yet, for emerging arboviruses we lack fundamental knowledge on the relationship between transmission and temperature. Current models rely on the untested assumption that Zika virus responds similarly to dengue virus, potentially limiting our ability to accurately predict the spread of Zika. We conducted experiments to estimate the thermal performance of Zika virus (ZIKV) in field-derived Aedes aegypti across eight constant temperatures. We observed strong, unimodal effects of temperature on vector competence, extrinsic incubation period and mosquito survival. We used thermal responses of these traits to update an existing temperature-dependent model to infer temperature effects on ZIKV transmission. ZIKV transmission was optimized at 298C, and had a thermal range of 22.78C-34.78C. Thus, as temperatures move towards the predicted thermal optimum (298C) owing to climate change, urbanization or seasonality, Zika could expand north and into longer seasons. By contrast, areas that are near the thermal optimum were predicted to experience a decrease in overall environmental suitability. We also demonstrate that the predicted thermal minimum for Zika transmission is 58C warmer than that of dengue, and current global estimates on the environmental suitability for Zika are greatly over-predicting its possible range. © 2018 The Authors.

	abstract = {Environmental limitations influence food production and distribution, adding up to global problems like world hunger. Conditions caused by climate change require global efforts to be improved, but others like soil degradation demand local management. For many years, saline soils were not a problem; indeed, natural salinity shaped different biomes around the world. However, overall saline soils present adverse conditions for plant growth, which then translate into limitations for agriculture. Shortage on the surface of productive land, either due to depletion of arable land or to soil degradation, represents a threat to the growing worldwide population. Hence, the need to use degraded land leads scientists to think of recovery alternatives. In the case of salt-affected soils (naturally occurring or human-made), which are traditionally washed or amended with calcium salts, bio-reclamation via microbiome presents itself as an innovative and environmentally friendly option. Due to their low pathogenicity, endurance to adverse environmental conditions, and production of a wide variety of secondary metabolic compounds, members of the genus Streptomyces are good candidates for bio-reclamation of salt-affected soils. Thus, plant growth promotion and soil bioremediation strategies combine to overcome biotic and abiotic stressors, providing green management options for agriculture in the near future. © 2020 by the authors.

While there is a pressing need to remediate polluted ecosystems, human intervention might unwittingly oppose selection for natural detoxification, which is primarily carried out by microbes. We test this possibility in the context of a ubiquitous chemical remediation strategy aimed at targeting metal pollution: the addition of lime-containing materials. Here, we show that raising pH by liming decreased the availability of toxic metals in acidic mine-degraded soils, but as a consequence selected against microbial taxa that naturally remediate soil through the production of metal-binding siderophores. Our results therefore highlight the crucial need to consider the eco-evolutionary consequences of human environmental strategies on microbial ecosystem services and other traits. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Biological invasions are on the rise globally. To reduce future invasions, it is imperative to determine the naturalization potential of species. Until now, screening approaches have relied largely on species-specific functional feature data. Such information is, however, time-consuming and expensive to collect, thwarting the screening of large numbers of potential invaders. We propose to resolve such data limitations by developing indicators of establishment success of alien species that can be readily derived from open-access databases. These indicators describe key features of successfully established aliens, including estimates of potential range size, niche overlap with human-disturbed environments, and proxies of species traits related to their palaeoinvasions and local dominance capacities. We demonstrate the utility of this new approach by applying it to two large and highly invasive plant groups: Australian acacias and eucalypts. Our results show that these indicators robustly predict establishment successes and failures in each clade independently, and that they can cross-predict establishment in these two clades. Interestingly, the indicator identified as most important was species potential range size on Earth, a variable too rarely considered as a predictor. By successfully identifying key features that predispose Australian plants to naturalize, we provide an objective and cost-effective protocol for flagging high-risk introductions. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Species' traits influence how populations respond to land-use change. However, even in well-characterized groups such as birds, widely studied traits explain only a modest proportion of the variance in response across species. Here, we show that associations with particular forest types strongly predict the sensitivity of forest-dwelling Amazonian birds to agriculture. Incorporating these fine-scale habitat associations into models of population response dramatically improves predictive performance and markedly outperforms the functional traits that commonly appear in similar analyses. Moreover, by identifying habitat features that support assemblages of unusually sensitive habitat-specialist species, our model furnishes straightforward conservation recommendations. In Amazonia, species that specialize on forests along a soil-nutrient gradient (i.e. both rich-soil specialists and poor-soil specialists) are exceptionally sensitive to agriculture, whereas species that specialize on floodplain forests are unusually insensitive. Thus, habitat specialization per se does not predict disturbance sensitivity, but particular habitat associations do. A focus on conserving specific habitats that harbour highly sensitive avifaunas (e.g. poor-soil forest) would protect a critically threatened component of regional biodiversity. We present a conceptual model to explain the divergent responses of habitat specialists in the different habitats, and we suggest that similar patterns and conservation opportunities probably exist for other taxa and regions. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Thousands of species have been introduced to new ranges worldwide. These introductions provide opportunities for researchers to study evolutionary changes in form and function in response to new environmental conditions. However, almost all previous studies of morphological change in introduced species have compared introduced populations to populations from across the species' native range, so variation within native ranges probably confounds estimates of evolutionary change. In this study, we used micro-satellites to locate the source population for the beach daisy Arctotheca populifolia that had been introduced to eastern Australia. We then compared four introduced populations from Australia with their original South African source population in a common-environment experiment. Despite being separated for less than 100 years, source and introduced populations of A. populifolia display substantial heritable morphological differences. Contrary to the evolution of increased competitive ability hypothesis, introduced plants were shorter than source plants, and introduced and source plants did not differ in total biomass. Contrary to predictions based on higher rainfall in the introduced range, introduced plants had smaller, thicker leaves than source plants. Finally, while source plants develop lobed adult leaves, introduced plants retain their spathulate juvenile leaf shape into adulthood. These changes indicate that rapid evolution in introduced species happens, but not always in the direction predicted by theory. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {An environment-friendly technique for synthesizing biomass-based mesoporous activated carbon with high nitrogen-/oxygen-chelating adsorption for Cu(II) is proposed. Bagasse impregnated with phosphoric acid is utilized as the precursor. To pyrolyze the precursor, two separate heating modes are used: microwave pyrolysis and conventional electric-heating pyrolysis. The resulting bagasse-derived carbon samples are modified with nitrification and reduction modification. Nitrogen (N)/oxygen (O) functional groups are simultaneously introduced to the surface of activated carbon, enhancing its adsorption of Cu(II) by complexing and ion-exchange. Characterization and copper adsorption experiments are performed to investigate the physicochemical properties of four prepared carbon samples and determine which heating method favors the subsequent modification for doping of N/O functional groups. In this technique, based on analyzing data of nitrogen adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and batch adsorption experiments, it is proven that microwave-pyrolyzed carbon has more defect sites and, therefore, time-saving effective microwave pyrolysis contributes more N/O species to the carbon, although it leads to a lower specific surface area. This technique offers a promising route to synthesis adsorbents with higher nitrogen and oxygen content and a higher adsorption capacity of heavy-metal ions in wastewater remediation applications. © 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

	abstract = {The surface of Staphylococcus aureus is decorated with over 20 proteins that are covalently anchored to peptidoglycan by the action of sortase A. These cell wallanchored (CWA) proteins can be classified into several structural and functional groups. The largest is the MSCRAMM family, which is characterized by tandemly repeated IgG-like folded domains that bind peptide ligands by the dock lock latch mechanism or the collagen triple helix by the collagen hug. Several CWA proteins comprise modules that have different functions, and some individual domains can bind different ligands, sometimes by different mechanisms. For example, the N-terminus of the fibronectin binding proteins comprises an MSCRAMM domain which binds several ligands, while the C-terminus is composed of tandem fibronectin binding repeats. Surface proteins promote adhesion to host cells and tissue, including components of the extracellular matrix, contribute to biofilm formation by stimulating attachment to the host or indwelling medical devices followed by cell-cell accumulation via homophilic interactions between proteins on neighboring cells, help bacteria evade host innate immune responses, participate in iron acquisition from host hemoglobin, and trigger invasion of bacteria into cells that are not normally phagocytic. The study of genetically manipulated strains using animal infection models has shown that many CWA proteins contribute to pathogenesis. Fragments of CWA proteins have the potential to be used in multicomponent vaccines to prevent S. aureus infections. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {The study subjected to estimate gene effects and inheritance of quantitative traits of rice with Generation Mean Analysis (GMA). Segregation analysis and estimation of genetic parameters under epistatic model indicated partial dominance and importance of additive effects in the inheritance of drought tolerance, respectively. In present study, absence of epistasis by scaling tests was recorded only for plant height in cross NDR-359 x P0 1564, grains per panicle in cross DSL-63-8 x NDR-359, test weight in cross Sarjoo-52 x P0 359, harvest-index in cross NDR-359 x P0 1564 and spikelets per panicle in cross Sarjoo-52 x P0 359 and NDR-359 x P0 1564 in irrigated condition and days to 50 per cent flowering in cross P0 359 x Sonam and harvest-index in cross NDR-359 x P0 1564 in drought condition. In remaining cases, existence of epistasis was observed in either one or both conditions by one or both types of scaling tests. The presence of complementary epistasis in cross P0 359 x Sonam and P0 1564 x Sarjoo-52 would make progress through selection procedures exploiting additive gene actions faster while existence of duplicate epistasis in cross NDR-359 x P0 1564 would have reverse impact. The non-additive gene effects in NDR-359 x P0 1564 for grain yield plant-1 may also be utilized for facilitating development of pureline cultivars by involving population improvement methods.

Harvest index contributed to the GY under the three water regimes. For high GY under drought transpiration rate at the beginning of drought and mid-grain filling was important at W                             75                             , whereas it was important at mid-grain filling and late-grain filling at W                             50                             . Stay-green trait can be scored simply with the relative number of green leaves/plants under both irrigated and stress environments. QTL pyramiding might not always be necessary to stabilize or increase the GY under post-flowering drought.

	abstract = {The physiological characteristics of Andean natives living at high altitudes have been investigated extensively, with many studies reporting that Andean highlanders have a higher hemoglobin (Hb) concentration than other highlander populations. It has previously been reported that positive natural selection has acted independently on the egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 1 (EGLN1) gene in Tibetan and Andean highlanders and is related to Hb concentration in Tibetans. However, no study has yet revealed the genetic determinants of Hb concentration in Andeans even though several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EGLN1 have previously been examined. Therefore, we explored the relationship between hematological measurements and tag SNPs designed to cover the whole EGLN1 genomic region in Andean highlanders living in Bolivia. Our findings indicated that haplotype frequencies estimated from the EGLN1 SNPs were significantly correlated with Hb concentration in the Bolivian highlanders. Moreover, we found that an Andean-dominant haplotype related to high Hb level may have expanded rapidly in ancestral Andean highlander populations. Analysis of genotype data in an 436.3 kb genomic region containing EGLN1 using public databases indicated that the population structure based on EGLN1 genetic markers in Andean highlanders was largely different from that in other human populations. This finding may be related to an intrinsic or adaptive physiological characteristic of Andean highlanders. In conclusion, the high Hb concentrations in Andean highlanders can be partly characterized by EGLN1 genetic variants.  © 2020 Yoshiki Yasukochi et al.},

	abstract = {A major challenge in ecology is to understand determinants of ecosystem functioning and stability in the face of disturbance. Some important species can strongly shape community structure and ecosystem functioning, but their impacts and interactions on ecosystem-level responses to disturbance are less well known. Shallow ponds provide a model system in which to study the effects of such species because some taxa mitigate transitions between alternative ecosystem states caused by eutrophication. We performed pond experiments to test how two foundation species (a macrophyte and a mussel) affected the biomass of planktonic primary producers and its stability in response to nutrient additions. Individually, each species reduced phytoplankton biomass and tended to increase rates of recovery from disturbance, but together the species reversed these effects, particularly with larger nutrient additions. This reversal was mediated by high cyanobacterial dominance of the community and a resulting loss of trait evenness. Effects of the foundation species on primary producer biomass were associated with effects on other ecosystem properties, including turbidity and dissolved oxygen. Our work highlights the important role of foundation species and their interactive effects in determining responses of ecosystem functioning to disturbance. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Extreme climatic events (ECEs) are increasing in frequency and intensity and this necessitates understanding their influence on organisms. Animal behaviour may mitigate the effects of ECEs, but field studies are rare because ECEs are infrequent and unpredictable. Hurricane Irma made landfall in southwestern Florida where we were monitoring white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus seminolus) with GPS collars. We report on an opportunistic case study of behavioural responses exhibited by a large mammal during an ECE, mitigation strategies for reducing the severity of the ECE effects, and the demographic effect of the ECE based on known-fate of individual animals. Deer altered resource selection by selecting higher elevation pine and hardwood forests and avoiding marshes. Most deer left their home ranges during Hurricane Irma, and the probability of leaving was inversely related to home range area. Movement rates increased the day of the storm, and no mortality was attributed to Hurricane Irma. We suggest deer mobility and refuge habitat allowed deer to behaviourally mitigate the negative effects of the storm, and ultimately, aid in survival. Our work contributes to the small but growing body of literature linking behavioural responses exhibited during ECEs to survival, which cumulatively will provide insight for predictions of a species resilience to ECEs and improve our understanding of how behavioural traits offset the negative impacts of global climate change. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

	abstract = {A striking pattern, seen in both fossil and extant taxa, is that tropical ectotherms are better at invading temperate habitats than vice versa. This is puzzling because tropical ectotherms, being thermal specialists, face a harsher abiotic environment and competition from temperate residents that are thermal generalists. We develop a mathematical framework to address this puzzle. We find that (i) tropical ectotherms can invade temperate habitats if they have higher consumption rates and lower mortality during warmer summers, (ii) stronger seasonal fluctuations at higher latitudes create more temporal niches, allowing coexistence of tropical invaders and temperate residents, and (iii) temperate ectotherms' failure to invade tropical habitats is due to greater mortality rather than lower competitive ability. Our framework yields predictions about population-level outcomes of invasion success based solely on species' trait responses to temperature. It provides a potential ecological explanation for why the tropics constitute both a cradle and a museum of biodiversity. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The invasion of land required amphibious fishes to evolve new strategies to avoid toxic ammonia accumulation in the absence of water flow over the gills. We investigated amphibious behaviour and nitrogen excretion strategies in six phylogenetically diverse Aplocheiloid killifishes (Anablepsoides hartii, Cynodonichthys hildebrandi, Rivulus cylindraceus, Kryptolebias marmoratus, Fundulopanchax gardneri, and Aplocheilus lineatus) in order to determine if a common strategy evolved. All species voluntarily emersed (left water) over several days, and also in response to environmental stressors (low O2, high temperature). All species were ammoniotelic in water and released gaseous ammonia (NH3 volatilization) during air exposure as the primary route for nitrogen excretion. Metabolic depression, urea synthesis, and/or ammonia accumulation during air exposure were not common strategies used by these species. Immunostaining revealed the presence of ammonia-transporting Rhesus proteins (Rhcg1 and Rhcg2) in the skin of all six species, indicating a shared mechanism for ammonia volatilization. We also found Rhcg in the skin of several other fully aquatic fishes, implying that cutaneous ammonia excretion is not exclusive to amphibious fishes. Overall, our results demonstrate that similar nitrogen excretion strategies while out of water were used by all killifish species tested; possibly the result of shared ancestral amphibious traits, phenotypic convergence, or a combination of both. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Coral reefs are the most diverse habitats in the marine realm. Their productivity, structural complexity, and biodiversity critically depend on ecosystem services provided by corals that are threatened because of climate change effects—in particular, ocean warming and acidification. The coral holobiont is composed of the coral animal host, endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, associated viruses, bacteria, and other microeukaryotes. In particular, the mandatory photosymbiosis with microalgae of the family Symbiodiniaceae and its consequences on the evolution, physiology, and stress resilience of the coral holobiont have yet to be fully elucidated. The functioning of the holobiont as a whole is largely unknown, although bacteria and viruses are presumed to play roles in metabolic interactions, immunity, and stress tolerance. In the context of climate change and anthropogenic threats on coral reef ecosystems, the Tara Pacific project aims to provide a baseline of the “-omics” complexity of the coral holobiont and its ecosystem across the Pacific Ocean and for various oceanographically distinct defined areas. Inspired by the previous Tara Oceans expeditions, the Tara Pacific expedition (2016–2018) has applied a pan-ecosystemic approach on coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean, drawing an east–west transect from Panama to Papua New Guinea and a south–north transect from Australia to Japan, sampling corals throughout 32 island systems with local replicates. Tara Pacific has developed and applied state-of-the-art technologies in very-high-throughput genetic sequencing and molecular analysis to reveal the entire microbial and chemical diversity as well as functional traits associated with coral holobionts, together with various measures on environmental forcing. This ambitious project aims at revealing a massive amount of novel biodiversity, shedding light on the complex links between genomes, transcriptomes, metabolomes, organisms, and ecosystem functions in coral reefs and providing a reference of the biological state of modern coral reefs in the Anthropocene.

	abstract = {Understanding diversity in flower-visitor assemblages helps us improve pollination of crops and support better biodiversity conservation outcomes. Much recent research has focused on drivers of crop-visitor diversity operating over spatial scales from fields to landscapes, such as pesticide and habitat management, while drivers operating over larger scales of continents and biogeographic realms are virtually unknown. Flower and visitor traits influence attraction of pollinators to flowers, and evolve in the context of associations that can be ancient or recent. Plants that have been adopted into agriculture have been moved widely around the world and thereby exposed to new flower visitors. Remarkably little is known of the consequence of these historical patterns for present-day crop-visiting bee diversity. We analyse data from 317 studies of 27 crops worldwide and find that crops are visited by fewer bee genera outside their region of origin and outside their family's region of origin. Thus, recent human history and the deeper evolutionary history of crops and bees appear to be important determinants of flower-visitor diversity at large scales that constrain the levels of visitor diversity that can be influenced by field-and landscape-scale interventions. © 2019 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Frogs and toads (Anura) exhibit some of the most diverse parental strategies in vertebrates. Identifying the evolutionary origins of parenting is fundamental to understanding the relationships between sexual selection, social evolution and parental care systems of contemporary Anura. Moreover, parenting has been hypothesized to allow the invasion of terrestrial habitats by the ancestors of terrestrial vertebrates. Using comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of frogs and toads based on data from over 1000 species that represent 46 out of 55 Anura families, we test whether parental care is associated with terrestrial reproduction and several life-history traits. Here, we show that both the duration of care and offspring protection by males and females have coevolved with terrestrial reproduction. Sexual size dimorphism is also related to care, because the large male size relative to female size is associated with increased paternal care. Furthermore, increased egg size and reduced clutch volume are associated with increased care in bivariate but not in multivariate analyses, suggesting that the relationships between care, egg size and clutch volume are mediated by terrestrial reproduction. Taken together, our results suggest that parenting by males and females has coevolved, and complex parenting traits have evolved several times independently in Anura in response to breeding in terrestrial environments. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Cycles, such as seasons or tides, characterize many systems in nature. Overwhelming evidence shows that climate change-driven alterations to environmental cycles-such as longer seasons-are associated with phenological shifts around the world, suggesting a deep link between environmental cycles and life cycles. However, general mechanisms of lifehistory evolution in cyclical environments are still not well understood. Here, I build a demographic framework and ask how life-history strategies optimize fitness when the environment perturbs a structured population cyclically and how strategies should change as cyclicality changes. I show that cycle periodicity alters optimality predictions of classic life-history theory because repeated cycles have rippling selective consequences over time and generations. Notably, fitness landscapes that relate environmental cyclicality and life-history optimality vary dramatically depending on which trade-offs govern a given species. The model tuned with known life-history trade-offs in a marine intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus successfully predicted the shape of life-history variation across natural populations spanning a gradient of tidal periodicities. This framework shows how environmental cycles can drive life-history variation-without complex assumptions of individual responses to cues such as temperature-thus expanding the range of life-history diversity explained by theory and providing a basis for adaptive phenology. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Metabolic scaling theory (MST) is one of ecology's most high-profile general models and can be used to link size distributions and productivity in forest systems. Much of MST's foundation is based on size distributions following a power law function with a scaling exponent of-2, a property assumed to be consistent in steady-state ecosystems. We tested the theory's generality by comparing actual size distributions with those predicted using MST parameters assumed to be general. We then used environmental variables and functional traits to explain deviation from theoretical expectations. Finally, we compared values of relative productivity predicted using MST with a remote-sensed measure of productivity. We found that fire-prone heath communities deviated from MST-predicted size distributions, whereas firesensitive rainforests largely agreed with the theory. Scaling exponents ranged from-1.4 to-5.3. Deviation from the power law assumption was best explained by specific leaf area, which varies along fire frequency and moisture gradients. While MST may hold in low-disturbance systems, we show that it cannot be applied under many environmental contexts. The theory should remain general, but understanding the factors driving deviation from MSTand subsequent refinements is required if it is to be applied robustly across larger scales. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Drought tolerance is an important quantitative trait with multipart phenotypes that are often further complicated by plant phenology. Different types of environmental stresses, such as high irradiance, high temperatures, nutrient deficiencies, and toxicities, may challenge crops simultaneously; therefore, breeding for drought tolerance is very complicated. Interdisciplinary researchers have been attempting to dissect and comprehend the mechanisms of plant tolerance to drought stress using various methods; however, the limited success of molecular breeding and physiological approaches suggests that we rethink our strategies. Recent genetic techniques and genomics tools coupled with advances in breeding methodologies and precise phenotyping will likely reveal candidate genes and metabolic pathways underlying drought tolerance in crops. The WRKY transcription factors are involved in different biological processes in plant development. This zinc (Zn) finger protein family, particularly members that respond to and mediate stress responses, is exclusively found in plants. A total of 89 WRKY genes in japonica and 97 WRKY genes in O. nivara (OnWRKY) have been identified and mapped onto individual chromosomes. To increase the drought tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa L.), research programs should address the problem using a multidisciplinary strategy, including the interaction of plant phenology and multiple stresses, and the combination of drought tolerance traits with different genetic and genomics approaches, such as microarrays, quantitative trait loci (QTLs), WRKY gene family members with roles in drought tolerance, and transgenic crops. This review discusses the newest advances in plant physiology for the exact phenotyping of plant responses to drought to update methods of analysing drought tolerance in rice. Finally, based on the physiological/morphological and molecular mechanisms found in resistant parent lines, a strategy is suggested to select a particular environment and adapt suitable germplasm to that environment. © 2018 Mahbod Sahebi et al.},

	abstract = {The speed and dynamics of range expansions shape species distributions and community composition. Despite the critical impact of population growth rates for range expansion, they are neglected in existing empirical studies, which focus on the investigation of selected life-history traits. Here, we present an approach based on non-invasive genetic capture-mark-recapture data for the estimation of adult survival, fecundity and juvenile survival, which determine population growth. We demonstrate the reliability of our method with simulated data, and use it to investigate life-history changes associated with range expansion in 35 colonies of the bat species Rhinolophus hipposideros. Comparing the demographic parameters inferred for 19 of those colonies which belong to an expanding population with those inferred for the remaining 16 colonies from a non-expanding population reveals that range expansion is associated with higher net reproduction. Juvenile survival was the main driver of the observed reproduction increase in this long-lived bat species with low per capita annual reproductive output. The higher average growth rate in the expanding population was not associated with a trade-off between increased reproduction and survival, suggesting that the observed increase in reproduction stems from a higher resource acquisition in the expanding population. Environmental conditions in the novel habitat hence seem to have an important influence on range expansion dynamics, and warrant further investigation for the management of range expansion in both native and invasive species. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Life-history traits such as spawning migrations and timing of reproduction are adaptations to specific environmental constraints and seasonal cycles in many organisms’ annual routines. In this study we analyse how offspring fitness constrains spawning phenology in a large migratory apex predator, the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The reproductive schedule of Atlantic bluefin tuna varies between spawning sites, suggesting plasticity to local environmental conditions. Generally, temperature is considered to be the main constraint on tuna spawning phenology. We combine evidence from longterm field data, temperature-controlled rearing experiments on eggs and larvae, and a model of egg fitness, and show that Atlantic bluefin tuna do not spawn to optimize egg and larval temperature exposure. The timing of spawning leads to temperature exposure considerably lower than optimal at all spawning grounds across the Atlantic Ocean. The early spawning is constrained by thermal inhibition of egg hatching and larval growth rates, but some other factors must prevent later spawning. Matching offspring with ocean productivity and the prey peak might be an important driver for bluefin tuna spawning phenology. This finding is important for predictions of reproductive timing in future climate warming scenarios for bluefin tuna. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is evidence that human activities are reducing the population genetic diversity of species worldwide. Given the prediction that parasites better exploit genetically homogeneous host populations, many species could be vulnerable to disease outbreaks. While agricultural studies have shown the devastating effects of infectious disease in crop monocultures, the widespread nature of this diversity-disease relationship remains unclear in natural systems. Here, we provide broad support that high population genetic diversity can protect against infectious disease by conducting a meta-analysis of 23 studies, with a total of 67 effect sizes. We found that parasite functional group (micro- or macroparasite) affects the presence of the effect and study setting (field or laboratory-based environment) influences the magnitude. Our study also suggests that host genetic diversity is overall a robust defence against infection regardless of host reproduction, parasite host range, parasite diversity, virulence and the method by which parasite success was recorded. Combined, these results highlight the importance of monitoring declines of host population genetic diversity as shifts in parasite distributions could have devastating effects on at-risk populations in nature. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {An individual's body size is central to its behaviour and physiology, and tightly linked to its movement ability. The spatial arrangement of resources and a consumer's capacity to locate them are therefore expected to exert strong selection on consumer body size. We investigated the evolutionary impact of both the fragmentation and loss of habitat on consumer body size and its feedback effects on resource distribution, under varying levels of information used during habitat choice. We developed a mechanistic, individual-based, spatially explicit model, including several allometric rules for key consumer traits. Our model reveals that as resources become more fragmented and scarce, informed habitat choice selects for larger body sizes while random habitat choice promotes small sizes. Information use may thus be an overlooked explanation for the observed variation in body size responses to habitat fragmentation. Moreover, we find that resources can accumulate and aggregate if information about resource abundance is incomplete. Informed movement results in stable resource - consumer dynamics and controlled resources across space. However, habitat loss and fragmentation destabilize local dynamics and disturb resource suppression by the consumer. Considering information use during movement is thus critical to understand the eco-evolutionary dynamics underlying the functioning and structuring of consumer communities. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Plants do not live in isolation but constantly interact with an array of microorganisms in the soil and in the atmosphere. This interaction is again affected by various environmental factors, and when the environmental conditions become unfavorable, they impose different stresses on the plant. With increasing urbanization and population leading to adverse conditions such as extremes of temperatures, water deficit, salinity, and an increase of heavy metal pollutants in the soil, ways and means are now being sought to make plants more resilient. Use of beneficial microorganisms with multiple traits not only for plant growth promotion and disease reduction, but also for alleviation of abiotic stresses is now being considered. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), endophytic bacteria, symbiotic fungi such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) or endophytes as well as some plant growth promoting fungi such as Trichoderma are being evaluated for such multiple uses in sustainable agriculture. All of these mainly act by mechanisms which reduce effects such as oxidative stress or cellular metabolic disruptions brought about by different stresses. In the present review we have attempted to bring together available literature on this subject and discuss the various beneficial plant microbial interactions which lead to amelioration of abiotic stresses, as well as promotion of growth in plants and to analyze the various mechanisms involved in the observed beneficial effect. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscopy, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and Sprague-Dawley rat model were used to characterize the microstructure, in vitro cytotoxicity, and in vivo bone-healing properties of the investigated biocomposite material. Analytical results found that the hydrothermal reaction-synthesized local HA had a hexagonal close-packed structure. The addition of extracted S. hermanni collagen did not influence the microstructure and functional groups of the local HA. Moreover, the MTT assay indicated that the investigated biocomposite material possessed a good in vitro biocompatibility. The in vivo animal study also revealed that the investigated biocomposite material exhibited the highest number of osteoblasts after 14 days of healing.

	abstract = {A growing body of research demonstrates the impacts of invasive alien plants on native animals, but few studies consider thermal effects as a driver of the responses of native organisms. As invasive alien plants establish and alter the composition and arrangement of plant communities, the thermal landscapes available to ectotherms also change. Our study reviews the research undertaken to date on the thermal effects of alien plant invasions on native reptiles, amphibians, insects and arachnids. The 37 studies published between 1970 and early 2019 portray an overall detrimental effect of invasive plants on thermal landscapes, ectothermic individuals' performance and species abundance, diversity and composition. With a case study of a lizard species, we illustrate the use of thermal ecology tools in plant invasion research and test the generality of alien plant effects: changes in thermoregulation behaviour in invaded landscapes varied depending on the level of invasion and lizard traits. Together, the literature review and case study show that thermal effects of alien plants on ectotherms can be substantial albeit context-dependent. Further research should cover multiple combinations of native/invasive plant growth forms, invasion stages and ectotherm traits. More attention is also needed to test causality along the chain of effects from thermal landscapes to individuals, populations and communities. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Broad evidence has shown that host diversity can impede disease invasion and reduce the eventual prevalence, but little is known on how species interactions play in shaping this host diversity-disease relationship. Previous work has illustrated that intraguild predation (IGP), combined with parasite-mediated indirect effects, can have strong influences on parasitic infection. Following this line of thinking, we here examine the role of predatory interactions in the disease transmission within a multihost community. Through varying fractions of IGP in a competitive community, we show that, dependent on the fraction of predatory interactions, species richness can switch from enhancing to inhibiting disease establishment/prevalence. Without IGP interactions, high host species richness can likely weaken the ‘dilution effect’ and in some cases even enhance the disease establishment (and/or prevalence) due to the existence of alternative sources for infection, whereas IGP can generally heighten the negative diversity-disease relationship due to the reduction of encounter rate between prospective hosts and parasites. Although trait-mediated interactions (captured as the infection-induced changes in predation rate) only weakly affect disease prevalence, density-mediated interactions (captured as the additional infection-induced mortality) can pose a relatively strong influence on disease transmission. Our results thus underline the importance of considering species interactions when investigating the host diversity-disease relationship. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Darwin's Camarhynchus finches are threatened by the introduced fly Philornis downsi that is thought to have accidentally arrived on the Galapagos Islands during the 1960s. The P. downsi larvae feed on the blood and tissue of developing finches, causing on average approximately 55% in-nest mortality and enlarged naris size in survivors. Here we test if enlarged naris size is associated with song characteristics and vocal deviation in the small tree finch (Camarhynchus parvulus), the critically endangered medium tree finch (C. pauper) and the recently observed hybrid tree finch group (Camarhynchus hybrids). Male C. parvulus and C. pauper with enlarged naris size produced song with lower maximum frequency and greater vocal deviation, but there was no significant association in hybrids. Less vocal deviation predicted faster pairing success in both parental species. Finally, C. pauper males with normal naris size produced species-specific song, but male C. pauper with enlarged naris size had song that was indistinguishable from other tree finches. When parasites disrupt host mating signal, they may also facilitate hybridization. Here we show how parasite-induced naris enlargement affects vocal quality, resulting in blurred species mating signals. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Current climate change is characterized by an increase in weather variability, which includes altered means, variance and predictability of weather parameters, and which may affect an organism's ecology and evolution. Few studies have experimentally manipulated the variability of weather parameters, and very little is known about the effects of changes in the intrinsic predictability of weather parameters on living organisms. Here, we experimentally tested the effects of differences in intrinsic precipitation-predictability on two herbaceous plants (Onobrychis viciifolia and Papaver rhoeas). Lower precipitation-predictability led to phenological advance and to an increase in reproductive success, and population growth. Both species exhibited rapid transgenerational responses in phenology and fitness-related traits across four generations that mitigated most effects of precipitation-predictability on fitness proxies of ancestors. Transgenerational responses appeared to be the result of changes in phenotypic plasticity rather than local adaptation. They mainly existed with respect to conditions prevailing during early, but not during late growth, suggesting that responses to differences in predictability during late growth might be more difficult. The results show that lower short-term predictability of precipitation positively affected fitness, rapid transgenerational responses existed and different time scales of predictability (short-term, seasonal and transgenerational predictability) may affect organisms differently. This shows that the time scale of predictability should be considered in evolutionary and ecological theories, and in assessments of the consequences of climate change. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Bigger seeds represent an agronomic and economic benefit but the breeding and ecological balance between seed size and number is difficult to find. Large seeds associated with other practices can improve crop competitiveness as they are more vigorous and result in healthier crops with higher yields, even under stressful conditions. Applying genomic research and genome‐wide association studies to breeding is generating new strategies to improve seed traits and novel insights into the biology of seed development and metabolism that are discussed in this chapter. The DNA amount differs among the seed tissues and amplifying genomic DNA by endocycle induction and endoreduplication can play a role in the phenotypic plasticity of seed development and size. Such phenomena are probably controlled by cell expansion and thereby also determine final cell size. Changes in plant growth are associated with changes in seed mass, which in turn limit seed protein content and weight. The reasons why a seed has a definite development regardless of resources available remain unexplained but regulating seed size may be a solution to stabilize yield in many crops. A major question is to identify those genes that make seed setting and final seed size less susceptible to stress, given that both genetic and epigenetic regulations are modulated by the environment. Endopolyploidy is a factor controlling organ size, which raises new questions on its implication in cell expansion and opens up a new perspective to control final seed size. This could lead to finding solutions for an agroecological adaptation to adverse climatic changes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published 2020 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity is challenged worldwide by exploitation, global warming, changes in land use and increasing urbanization. It is hypothesized that communities in urban areas should consist primarily of generalist species with broad niches that are able to cope with novel, variable, fragmented, warmer and unpredictable environments shaped by human pressures. We surveyed moth communities in three cities in northern Europe and compared them with neighbouring moth assemblages constituting species pools of potential colonizers. We found that urban moth communities consisted of multi-dimensional generalist species that had larger distribution ranges, more variable colour patterns, longer reproductive seasons, broader diets, were more likely to overwinter as an egg, more thermophilic, and occupied more habitat types compared with moth communities in surrounding areas. When body size was analysed separately, results indicated that city occupancy was associated with larger size, but this effect disappeared when body size was analysed together with the other traits. Our findings indicate that urbanization imposes a spatial filtering process in favour of thermophilic species characterized by high intraspecific diversity and multi-dimensional generalist lifestyles over specialized species with narrow niches. © 2020 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A single cheating mutant can lead to the invasion and eventual eradication of cooperation from a population. Consequently, cheat invasion is often considered equal to extinction in empirical and theoretical studies of cooperator-cheat dynamics. But does cheat invasion necessarily equate extinction in nature? By following the social dynamics of iron metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis lung infection, we observed that individuals evolved to replace cooperation with a ‘private’ behaviour. Phenotypic assays showed that cooperative iron acquisition frequently was upregulated early in infection, which, however, increased the risk of cheat invasion. With whole-genome sequencing we showed that if, and only if, cooperative iron acquisition is lost from the population, a private system was upregulated. The benefit of upregulation depended on iron availability. These findings highlight the importance of social dynamics of natural populations and emphasizes the potential impact of past social interaction on the evolution of private traits. © Andersen et al.},

	abstract = {Evaluating intrinsic and extrinsic traits that predispose species to local extinction is important for targeting conservation efforts. Among the species of special concern in Europe are bees, which, along with butterflies, are the best monitored insects. Bees are most species-rich in Mediterranean-Type climates with short winters, warm springs, and dry summers. In Central Europe, climate warming per se is, therefore, expected to benefit most bee species, while pesticides and the loss of habitats and plant diversity should constitute threats. Here, we use the bee fauna of Germany, which has been monitored for Red Lists for over 40 years, to analyse the effects of habitat breadth, pollen specialization, body size, nesting sites, sociality, duration of flight activity, and time of emergence during the season. We tested each factor's predictive power against changes in commonness and Red List status, using phylogenetically informed hierarchical Bayesian (HB) models. Extinction vulnerability is strongly increased in bees flying in late summer, with a statistical model that included flight time, habitat preference, and duration of activity correctly predicting the vulnerability status of 85% of the species. Conversely, spring emergence and occurrence in urban areas each reduce vulnerability, pointing to intensive land use especially harming summer-Active bees, with the combination of these factors currently shifting Germany's bee diversity towards warm-Adapted, spring-flying, city-dwelling species. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Horizontal transfer (HT) of heritable information or ’traits’ (carried by genetic elements, plasmids, endosymbionts, or culture) is widespread among living organisms. Yet current ecological and evolutionary theory addressing HT is scant. We present a modeling framework for the dynamics of two populations that compete for resources and horizontally exchange (transfer) an otherwise vertically inherited trait. Competition influences individual demographics, thereby affecting population size, which feeds back on the dynamics of transfer. This feedback is captured in a stochastic individual-based model, from which we derive a general model for the contact rate, with frequency-dependent (FD) and density-dependent (DD) rates as special cases. Taking a large-population limit on the stochastic individual-level model yields a deterministic Lotka-Volterra competition system with additional terms accounting for HT. The stability analysis of this system shows that HT can revert the direction of selection: HT can drive invasion of a deleterious trait, or prevent invasion of an advantageous trait. Due to HT, invasion does not necessarily imply fixation. Two trait values may coexist in a stable polymorphism even if their invasion fitnesses have opposite signs, or both are negative. Addressing the question of how the stochasticity of individual processes influences population fluctuations, we identify conditions on competition and mode of transfer (FD versus DD) under which the stochasticity of transfer events overwhelms demographic stochasticity. Assuming that one trait is initially rare, we derive invasion and fixation probabilities and time. In the case of costly plasmids, which are transfered unilaterally, invasion is always possible if the transfer rate is large enough; under DD and for intermediate values of the transfer rate, maintenance of the plasmid in a polymorphic population is possible. In conclusion, HT interacts with ecology (competition) in non-trivial ways. Our model provides a basis to model the influence of HT on evolutionary adaptation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {For many years, the breeding in plant and animal genomes has been per- formed using phenotypic selection, but although this strategy is still being used, many traits that could not be modified by classical breeding techniques have been introduced by genetic engineering, allowing to break the species barriers. These genetically modified organisms (GMOs) caused a revolution in the agriculture and enzyme production, since new plant and microorganism genotypes could be obtained, generating new process and strategies to produce food and enzyme. Although, plants expressing herbicide (glyphosate) and insect (Bt plants) resistance are the most used GMO, many other traits have been introduced in plants and micro- organisms. The use of GM microorganisms (GMMs) in contention (e.g., in bioreac- tors) for the production of enzymes, drugs, biofuels, and chemical modification is common and widespread, but the releasing of this GMM is still been studied. In this chapter, we describe how this technology has been applied in tropical countries, including the possibilities that could be applied in these countries.

	abstract = {Forest dynamics encompass changes in stand structure, species composition, and species interactions with disturbance and environment over a range of spatial and temporal scales. For convenience, spatial scale is defined as individual tree, neighborhood, stand, and landscape. Whether a given canopy-leveling disturbance will initiate a sequence of development in structure with little change in composition or initiate an episode of succession depends on a match or mismatch, respectively, with traits of the dominant tree species that allow the species to survive disturbance. When these match, certain species-disturbance type combinations lock in a pattern of stand and landscape dynamics that can persist for several generations of trees; thus, dominant tree species regulate, as well as respond to, disturbance. A complex interaction among tree species, neighborhood effects, disturbance type and severity, landform, and soils determines how stands of differing composition form and the mosaic of stands that compose the landscape. Neighborhood effects (e.g., serotinous seed rain, sprouting, shading, leaf-litter chemistry, and leaf-litter physical properties) operate at small spatial extents of the individual tree and its neighbors but play a central role in forest dynamics by contributing to patch formation at stand scales and dynamics of the entire landscape. Dominance by tree species with neutral to negative neighborhood effects leads to unstable landscape dynamics in disturbance-prone regions, wherein most stands are undergoing succession; stability can only occur under very low-severity disturbance regimes. Dominance by species with positive effects leads to stable landscape dynamics wherein only a small proportion of stands undergo succession at any one time. Positive neighborhood effects are common in temperate and boreal zones, whereas negative effects are more common in tropical climates. Landscapes with positive dynamics have alternate categories of dynamics stabilized by high-severity and low-severity disturbance regimes. Contrary to prevailing ecological theory, systems with positive neighborhood effects can have similar levels of compositional stability across tree, stand, and landscape scales. Neighborhood effect theory can help explain responses of landscapes to large-scale land clearing and novel effects brought on by factors such as invasive species and deer overabundance. © 2016 Frelich L.},

	abstract = {Maintaining human cooperation in the context of common-pool resource management is extremely important because otherwise we risk overuse and corruption. To analyse the interplay between economic and ecological factors leading to corruption, we couple the resource dynamics and the evolutionary dynamics of strategic decision making into a powerful analytical framework. The traits of this framework are: (i) an arbitrary number of harvesters share the responsibility to sustainably exploit a specific part of an ecosystem, (ii) harvesters face three strategic choices for exploiting the resource, (iii) a delegated enforcement system is available if called upon, (iv) enforcers are either honest or corrupt, and (v) the resource abundance reflects the choice of harvesting strategies. The resulting dynamical system is bistable; depending on the initial conditions, it evolves either to cooperative (sustainable exploitation) or defecting (overexploitation) equilibria. Using the domain of attraction to cooperative equilibria as an indicator of successful management, we find that the more resilient the resource (as implied by a high growth rate), the more likely the dominance of corruption which, in turn, suppresses the cooperative outcome. A qualitatively similar result arises when slow resource dynamics relative to the dynamics of decision making mask the benefit of cooperation. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of managing common-pool resources. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Bacterial virulence is a multifaceted trait where the interactions between pathogen and host factors affect the severity and outcome of the infection. Toxin secretion is central to the biology of many bacterial pathogens and is widely accepted as playing a crucial role in disease pathology. To understand the relationship between toxicity and bacterial virulence in greater depth, we studied two sequenced collections of the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and found an unexpected inverse correlation between bacterial toxicity and disease severity. By applying a functional genomics approach, we identified several novel toxicity-affecting loci responsible for the wide range in toxic phenotypes observed within these collections. To understand the apparent higher propensity of low toxicity isolates to cause bacteraemia, we performed several functional assays, and our findings suggest that within-host fitness differences between high- and low-toxicity isolates in human serum is a contributing factor. As invasive infections, such as bacteraemia, limit the opportunities for onward transmission, highly toxic strains could gain an additional between-host fitness advantage, potentially contributing to the maintenance of toxicity at the population level. Our results clearly demonstrate how evolutionary trade-offs between toxicity, relative fitness, and transmissibility are critical for understanding the multifaceted nature of bacterial virulence. © 2015 Laabei et al.},

	abstract = {The science of complex systems is increasingly asked to forecast the consequences of climate change. As a result, scientists are now engaged in making predictions about an uncertain future, which entails the efficient communication of this uncertainty. Here we show the benefits of hierarchically decomposing the uncertainty in predicted changes in animal population size into its components due to structural uncertainty in climate scenarios (green-house gas emissions and global circulation models), structural uncertainty in the demographic model, climatic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity unexplained by climate-demographic trait relationships, and sampling variance in demographic parameter estimates. We quantify components of uncertainty surrounding the future abundance of a migratory bird, the greater snow goose (Chen caeruslescens atlantica), using a process-based demographic model covering their full annual cycle. Our model predicts a slow population increase but with a large prediction uncertainty. As expected from theoretical variance decomposition rules, the contribution of sampling variance to prediction uncertainty rapidly overcomes that of process variance and dominates. Among the sources of process variance, uncertainty in the climate scenarios contributed less than 3% of the total prediction variance over a 40-year period, much less than environmental stochasticity. Our study exemplifies opportunities to improve the forecasting of complex systems using long-term studies and the challenges inherent to predicting the future of stochastic systems. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Organelle-nuclear retrograde signaling regulates gene expression, but its roles in specialized cells and integration with hormonal signaling remain enigmatic. Here we show that the SAL1-PAP (30 -phosphoadenosine 50 - phosphate) retrograde pathway interacts with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling to regulate stomatal closure and seed germination in Arabidopsis. Genetically or exogenously manipulating PAP bypasses the canonical signaling components ABA Insensitive 1 (ABI1) and Open Stomata 1 (OST1); priming an alternative pathway that restores ABA-responsive gene expression, ROS bursts, ion channel function, stomatal closure and drought tolerance in ost12. PAP also inhibits wild type and abi1-1 seed germination by enhancing ABA sensitivity. PAP-XRN signaling interacts with ABA, ROS and Ca2+; up-regulating multiple ABA signaling components, including lowly-expressed Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPKs) capable of activating the anion channel SLAC1. Thus, PAP exhibits many secondary messenger attributes and exemplifies how retrograde signals can have broader roles in hormone signaling, allowing chloroplasts to finetune physiological responses. © Pornsiriwong et al.},

	abstract = {In this time of massive global change, species are now frequently interacting with novel players. Greater insight into the impact of these novel interactions on traits linked to fitness is essential, because effects on these traits can hinder population existence or promote rapid adaptation. Sexually selected weapons and ornaments frequently influence fitness and often have heightened condition-dependence in response to nutrition. Condition-dependence in response to different ecological conditions, a form of developmental plasticity, may be responsible for much of the intraspecific variation in sexually selected ornaments and weapons in wild populations. Here we examined the consequences of developing on a novel plant for the expression of size and shape in the leaf-footed cactus bug Narnia femorata (Hemiptera: Coreidae). The males of this species possess enlarged, sexually dimorphic femurs on their hind legs. These legs are used as weapons in male–male contests. Females are typically larger in overall body size. Our study revealed that developing upon a novel host can lead to pronounced phenotypically plastic change in sexually dimorphic traits. Male hind femurs were greatly impacted by the novel diet to the extent that the sexual dimorphism in hind femurs was lost. Further, dimorphism in body size increased, as males became tiny adults while females better maintained their body size. These patterns underscore the complex effects that novel species interactions may have on sexual phenotypes. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Plant-herbivore interactions shape community dynamics across marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. From amphipods to elephants and from algae to trees, plant-herbivore relationships are the crucial link generating animal biomass (and human societies) from mere sunlight. These interactions are, thus, pivotal to understanding the ecology and evolution of virtually any ecosystem. Here, we briefly highlight recent advances in four areas of plant-herbivore interactions: (1) plant defense theory, (2) herbivore diversity and ecosystem function, (3) predation risk aversion and herbivory, and (4) how a changing climate impacts plant-herbivore interactions. Recent advances in plant defense theory, for example, highlight how plant life history and defense traits affect and are affected by multiple drivers, including enemy pressure, resource availability, and the local plant neighborhood, resulting in trait-mediated feedback loops linking trophic interactions with ecosystem nutrient dynamics. Similarly, although the positive effect of consumer diversity on ecosystem function has long been recognized, recent advances using DNA barcoding to elucidate diet, and Global Positioning System/remote sensing to determine habitat selection and impact, have shown that herbivore communities are probably even more functionally diverse than currently realized. Moreover, although most diversity-function studies continue to emphasize plant diversity, herbivore diversity may have even stronger impacts on ecosystem multifunctionality. Recent studies also highlight the role of risk in plant-herbivore interactions, and risk-driven trophic cascades have emerged as landscape-scale patterns in a variety of ecosystems. Perhaps not surprisingly, many plant-herbivore interactions are currently being altered by climate change, which affects plant growth rates and resource allocation, expression of chemical defenses, plant phenology, and herbivore metabolism and behavior. Finally, we conclude by noting that although the field is advancing rapidly, the world is changing even more rapidly, challenging our ability to manage these pivotal links in the food chain. © 2017 Burkepile DE and Parker JD.},

Through their functional traits, interactions with both abiotic and biotic environment, and their own successional dynamics, they significantly affect woody vegetation succession coupled with soil and ecosystem development. In this chapter, we review the role of ECM fungi in the processes of early primary and secondary succession, including non-anthropogenic natural systems, like glacier forefronts, volcanic deserts, and sand dunes, as well as major sites disturbed by intensive human activity, such as mine spoils, fire-affected sites, clear-cuts and timber harvesting areas, and post-agricultural lands. Successional traits of ECM fungal community reflecting their life histories and species composition, dispersal, spatial and temporal structure, host preferences, and sensitivity to environmental filters underpin key ecosystem services provided by ECM fungi in the processes of forest development, management, and restoration. While the rapidly increasing influence of climate change, environmental damage, species invasions, and biodiversity reduction become obvious, ECM fungi and their successional traits must be considered in afforestation and carbon sequestration polices, in sustainable forest management, as well as in biodiversity conservation and rehabilitation practices. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

We ask whether growth is isometric or allometric among corals, and whether most variation in coral growth rates occurs at the level of the species or morphological group. We estimate growth as change in planar area for 11 species, across five morphological groups and over 5 years. We show that coral growth rates are best predicted from colony size and morphology rather than species. Coral size follows a power scaling law with a constant exponent of 0.91. Despite being colonial organisms, corals have consistent allometric scaling in growth.

Fungi belonging to Aspergillus section Flavi were isolated in the ratio of 26.9% and 42.3% from soil and maize samples in 2013, and these ratios decreased to 16.1% and 34.7% in 2014. Based on morphological characteristics and the sequence analysis of the partial calmodulin gene, all isolates proved to be Aspergillus flavus, except four strains, which were identified as Aspergillus parasiticus. About half of the A. flavus strains and all the A. parasiticus strains were able to synthesize aflatoxins. Aflatoxigenic Aspergillus strains were isolated from all the seven regions of Hungary. A. parasiticus strains were found in the soil of the regions Southern Great Plain and Southern Transdanubia and in a maize sample of the region Western Transdanubia. In spite of the fact that aflatoxins have rarely been detected in feeds and foods in Hungary, aflatoxigenic A. flavus and A. parasiticus strains are present in the maize culture throughout Hungary posing a potential threat to food safety. © 2016 Akadémiai Kiado, Budapest.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton are key components of aquatic ecosystems, fixing CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and supporting secondary production, yet relatively little is known about how future global warming might alter their biodiversity and associated ecosystem functioning. Here, we explore how the structure, function, and biodiversity of a planktonic metacommunity was altered after five years of experimental warming. Our outdoor mesocosm experiment was open to natural dispersal from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Warming of 4°C led to a 67% increase in the species richness of the phytoplankton, more evenly-distributed abundance, and higher rates of gross primary productivity. Warming elevated productivity indirectly, by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the local phytoplankton communities. Warming also systematically shifted the taxonomic and functional trait composition of the phytoplankton, favoring large, colonial, inedible phytoplankton taxa, suggesting stronger top-down control, mediated by zooplankton grazing played an important role. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can modulate species coexistence, and through such mechanisms, global warming could, in some cases, increase the species richness and productivity of phytoplankton communities. © 2015 Yvon-Durocher et al.},

	abstract = {Pollution caused by heavy metals is one of the most serious environmental problems for society. Industrial activities increase the concentration of heavy metals such as Cu(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Pb(II) and Ni(II) in aquatic systems and mainly in the fields of mechanics, electrics, electronics, tanning, galvanization, oil industries and mining. Biomagnification of these metals occurs through the toxicity of the trophic for humans. As a remedial measure, it is for scientists to find new biosorbents which are able to ameliorate the possible toxic effects of heavy metals in water bodies. Studies of bioadsorption have identified this as a real alternative to wastewater treatment, especially for the removal of heavy metals. This chapter explores (1) the characterization of new biosorbents via surface acid-base titration, where the type of functional groups can be tentatively computed, (2) kinetics of bioadsorption (pseudo-first and second order), (3) bioadsorption as a function of pH and (4) bioadsorption as a function of metal concentration in solution (Langmuir, Freundlich, Sips, Redlich-Peterson, Tóth, Frumkin and Temkin isotherms), where the maximum adsorption capacity can be determined under different experimental conditions. The majority of bioadsorption studies have been carried out at laboratory scale; however, future studies will be conducted at industrial scale as a way to remediate heavy metal pollution in water bodies. Different commercial biosorbents and their characteristics are presented in this chapter. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Two main mechanisms may buffer ecosystem functions despite biodiversity loss. First, multiple species could share similar ecological roles, thus providing functional redundancy. Second, species may respond differently to environmental change (response diversity). However, ecosystem function would be best protected when functionally redundant species also show response diversity. This linkage has not been studied directly, so we investigated whether native and exotic pollinator species with similar traits (functional redundancy) differed in abundance (response diversity) across an agricultural intensification gradient. Exotic pollinator species contributed most positive responses, which partially stabilized overall abundance of the pollinator community. However, although some functionally redundant species exhibited response diversity, this was not consistent across functional groups and aggregate abundances within each functional group were rarely stabilized. This shows functional redundancy and response diversity do not always operate in concert. Hence, despite exotic species becoming increasingly dominant in human-modified systems, they cannot replace the functional composition of native species. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Understanding how range-edge populations will respond to climate change is an urgent research priority. Here, we used a phylogenetic community ecology approach to examine how ecological and evolutionary processes shape biodiversity patterns of scleractinian corals at their high-latitude range limits in eastern Australia. We estimated phylogenetic signal in seven ecologically important functional traits and conducted tests of phylogenetic structure at local and regional scales using the net relatedness (NRI) and nearest taxon indices (NTI) for the presence/absence and abundance data. Regional tests showed light phylogenetic clustering, indicating that coral species found in this subtropical-to-temperate transition zone are more closely related to each other than are species on the nearby, more northerly Great Barrier Reef. Local tests revealed variable patterns of phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion and higher than expected phylogenetic turnover among sites. In combination, these results are broadly consistent with the hierarchical filtering model, whereby species pass through a regional climatic filter based on their tolerances for marginal conditions and subsequently segregate into local assemblages according to the relative strength of habitat filtering and species interactions. Conservatism of tested traits suggests that corals will likely track their niches with climate change. Nevertheless, high turnover of lineages among sites indicates that range shifts will probably vary among species and highlights the vulnerability and conservation significance of high-latitude reefs. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Climate change affects ecological communities through its impact on the physiological performance of individuals. However, the population dynamic of species well inside their thermal niche is also determined by competitors, prey and predators, in addition to being influenced by temperature changes. We use a trait-based food-web model to examine how the interplay between the direct physiological effects from temperature and the indirect effects due to changing interactions between populations shapes the ecological consequences of climate change for populations and for entire communities. Our simulations illustrate how isolated communities deteriorate as populations go extinct when the environment moves outside the species’ thermal niches. High-trophic-level species are most vulnerable, while the ecosystem function of lower trophic levels is less impacted. Open communities can compensate for the loss of ecosystem function by invasions of new species. Individual populations show complex responses largely uncorrelated with the direct impact of temperature change on physiology. Such complex responses are particularly evident during extinction and invasion events of other species, where climaticallywell-adapted species may be brought to extinction by the changed food-web topology. Our results highlight that the impact of climate change on specific populations is largely unpredictable, and apparently well-adapted species may be severely impacted. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

To identify transcriptomic changes that occur in the crop Brassica rapa during initial perception of drought, we applied a co-expression network approach to associate rhythmic gene expression changes with physiological responses. Coupled analysis of transcriptome and physiological parameters over a two-day time course in control and drought-stressed plants provided temporal resolution necessary for correlation of network modules with dynamic changes in stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate, and photosystem II efficiency. This approach enabled the identification of drought-responsive genes based on their differential rhythmic expression profiles in well-watered versus droughted networks and provided new insights into the dynamic physiological changes that occur during drought. © Greenham et al.},

	abstract = {The success of early life-history stages is an environmentally sensitive bottleneck for many marine invertebrates. Responses of larvae to environmental stress may vary due to differences in maternal investment of energy stores and acclimatization/adaptation of a population to local environmental conditions. In this study, we compared two populations from sites with different environmental regimes (Moorea and Taiwan). We assessed the responses of Pocillopora damicornis larvae to two future co-occurring environmental stressors: Elevated temperature and ocean acidification. Larvae from Taiwan were more sensitive to temperature, producing fewer energy-storage lipids under high temperature. In general, planulae in Moorea and Taiwan responded similarly to pCO2. Additionally, corals in the study sites with different environments produced larvae with different initial traits, which may have shaped the different physiological responses observed. Notably, under ambient conditions, planulae in Taiwan increased their stores of wax ester and triacylglycerol in general over the first 24 h of their dispersal, whereas planulae from Moorea consumed energy-storage lipids in all cases. Comparisons of physiological responses of P. damicornis larvae to conditions of ocean acidification and warming between sites across the species’ biogeographic range illuminates the variety of physiological responses maintained within P. damicornis, which may enhance the overall persistence of this species in the light of global climate change. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Hybridization between native and non-native species has serious biological consequences, but our understanding of how dispersal and selection interact to influence invasive hybridization is limited. Here, we document the spread of genetic introgression between a native (Oncorhynchus clarkii) and invasive (Oncorhynchus mykiss) trout, and identify the mechanisms influencing genetic admixture. In two populations inhabiting contrasting environments, non-native admixture increased rapidly from 1984 to 2007 and was driven by surprisingly consistent processes. Individual admixture was related to two phenotypic traits associated with fitness: size at spawning and age of juvenile emigration. Fish with higher non-native admixture were larger and tended to emigrate at a younger age—relationships that are expected to confer fitness advantages to hybrid individuals. However, strong selection against non-native admixture was evident across streams and cohorts (mean selection coefficient against genotypes with non-native alleles (s) ¼ 0.60; s.e. ¼ 0.10). Nevertheless, hybridization was promoted in both streams by the continuous immigration of individuals with high levels of non-native admixture from other hybrid source populations. Thus, antagonistic relationships between dispersal and selection are mediating invasive hybridization between these fish, emphasizing that data on dispersal and natural selection are needed to fully understand the dynamics of introgression between native and non-native species. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Early pig farmers in Europe importedAsian pigs to cross with their local breeds in order to improve traits of commercial interest. Current genomics techniques enabled genome-wide identification of these Asian introgressed haplotypes in modern European pig breeds.We propose that the Asian variants are still present because they affect phenotypes thatwere important for ancient traditional, as well as recent, commercial pig breeding. Genome-wide introgression levels were only weakly correlated with gene content and recombination frequency. However, regions with an excess or absence of Asian haplotypes (AS) contained genes that were previously identified as phenotypically important such as FASN, ME1, and KIT. Therefore, the Asian alleles are thought to have an effect on phenotypes thatwere historically under selection.We aimed to estimate the effect of AS in introgressed regions in Large White pigs on the traits of backfat (BF) and litter size. The majority of regions we tested that retained Asian deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) showed significantly increased BF from the Asian alleles. Our results suggest that the introgression in Large White pigs has been strongly determined by the selective pressure acting upon the introgressed AS. We therefore conclude that human-driven hybridization and selection contributed to the genomic architecture of these commercial pigs. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is generally considered to be sensitive to drought stress. Even short periods of water shortage can result in reduced tuber production and quality. We previously reported that transgenic potato plants expressing the sweet potato orange gene (IbOr) under the control of the stress-inducible SWPA2 promoter (referred to as SOR plants) showed increased tolerance to methyl viologen-mediated oxidative stress and high salinity, along with increased carotenoid contents. In this study, in an effort to improve the productivity and environmental stress tolerance of potato, we subjected transgenic potato plants expressing IbOr to water-deficient conditions in the greenhouse. The SOR plants exhibited increased tolerance to drought stress under greenhouse conditions. IbOr expression was associated with slightly negative phenotypes, including reduced tuber production. Controlling IbOr expression imparted the same degree of drought tolerance while ameliorating these negative phenotypic effects, leading to levels of tuber production similar to or better than those of wild-type plants under drought stress conditions. In particular, under drought stress, drought tolerance and the production of marketable tubers (over 80 g) were improved in transgenic plants compared with non-transgenic plants. These results suggest that expressing the IbOr transgene can lead to significant gains in drought tolerance and tuber production in potato, thereby improving these agronomically important traits. © 2016 Académie des sciences},

	abstract = {The expected link between competitive exclusion and community trait overdispersion has been used to infer competition in local communities, and trait clustering has been interpreted as habitat filtering. Such community assembly process inference has received criticism for ignoring trophic interactions, as competition and trophic interactions might create similar trait patterns. While other theoretical studies have generally demonstrated the importance of predation for coexistence, ours provides the first quantitative demonstration of such effects on assembly process inference, using a trait-based ecological model to simulate the assembly of a competitive primary consumer community with and without the influence of trophic interactions. We quantified and contrasted trait dispersion/clustering of the competitive communities with the absence and presence of secondary consumers. Trophic interactions most often decreased trait clustering (i.e. increased dispersion) in the competitive communities due to evenly distributed invasions of secondary consumers and subsequent competitor extinctions over trait space. Furthermore, effects of trophic interactions were somewhat dependent on model parameters and clustering metric. These effects create considerable problems for process inference from trait distributions; one potential solution is to use more process-based and inclusive models in inference. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Lineages tend to retain ecological characteristics of their ancestors through time. However, for some traits, selection during evolutionary history may have also played a role in determining trait values. To address the relative importance of these processes requires large-scale quantification of traits and evolutionary relationships among species. The Amazonian tree flora comprises a high diversity of angiosperm lineages and species with widely differing life-history characteristics, providing an excellent system to investigate the combined influences of evolutionary heritage and selection in determining trait variation. We used trait data related to the major axes of life-history variation among tropical trees (e.g. growth and mortality rates) from 577 inventory plots in closed-canopy forest, mapped onto a phylogenetic hypothesis spanning more than 300 genera including all major angiosperm clades to test for evolutionary constraints on traits. We found significant phylogenetic signal (PS) for all traits, consistent with evolutionarily related genera having more similar characteristics than expected by chance. Although there is also evidence for repeated evolution of pioneer and shade tolerant life-history strategies within independent lineages, the existence of significant PS allows clearer predictions of the links between evolutionary diversity, ecosystem function and the response of tropical forests to global change. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Predicting the impacts of non-native species remains a challenge. As populations of a species are genetically and phenotypically variable, the impact of non-native species on local taxa could crucially depend on populations-pecific traits and adaptations of both native and non-native species. Bitterling fishes are brood parasites of unionid mussels and unionid mussels produce larvae that parasitize fishes. We used common garden experiments to measure three key elements in the bitterling–mussel association among two populations of an invasive mussel (Anodonta woodiana) and four populations of European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus). The impact of the invasive mussel varied between geographically distinct R. amarus lineages and between local populations within lineages. The capacity of parasitic larvae of the invasive mussel to exploit R. amarus was higher in a Danubian than in a Baltic R. amarus lineage and in allopatric than in sympatric R. amarus populations. Maladaptive oviposition by R. amarus into A. woodiana varied among populations, with significant population-specific consequences for R. amarus recruitment. We suggest that variation in coevolutionary states may predispose different populations to divergent responses. Given that coevolutionary relationships are ubiquitous, population-specific attributes of invasive and native populations may play a critical role in the outcome of invasion. We argue for a shift from a species-centred to population-centred perspective of the impacts of invasions. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Ecological research often assumes that species are adapted to their current climatic environments. However, climate fluctuations over geologic timescales have influenced species dispersal and extinction, which in turn may affect community structure. Modern community structure is likely to be the product of both palaeoclimate and modern climate, with the relative degrees of influence of past and present climates unknown. Here, we assessed the influence of climate at different time periods on the phylogenetic and functional trait structure of 203 African mammal communities. We found that the climate of the mid-Holocene (approx. 6000 years ago) and Last Glacial Maximum (approx. 22 000 years ago) were frequently better predictors of community structure than modern climate for mammals overall, carnivorans and ungulates. Primate communities were more strongly influenced by modern climate than palaeoclimate. Overall, community structure of African mammals appears to be related to the ecological flexibility of the groups considered here and the regions of continental Africa that they occupy. Our results indicate that the future redistribution, expansion and contraction of particular biomes due to human activity, such as climate and land-use change, will differentially affect mammal groups that vary in their sensitivity to environmental change. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Identification of genomic regions associated with drought-related traits is essential for improving drought tolerance in barley. Association mapping was implemented to investigate the associations between 76 SSR markers and six drought-related traits on a set of 107 barley accessions evaluated under well-watered and drought-stressed conditions. Highly significant differences between well-watered and drought-stressed conditions were observed in all measured traits. A high level of polymorphism with SSR markers was observed. A total of 36 significant marker-trait associations for drought-related traits were detected. A high extent of significant LD (>61%) was observed between markers on different chromosomes, suggesting epistatic interaction. Several molecular markers are significantly associated with more than one phenotypic trait, suggesting the possible presence of pleiotropic or indirect effects.

	abstract = {Species around the world have suffered collapses, and a key question is why some populations are more vulnerable than others. Traditional conservation biology and evidence from terrestrial species suggest that slow-growing populations are most at risk, but interactions between climate variability and harvest dynamics may alter or even reverse this pattern. Here, we test this hypothesis globally.We use boosted regression trees to analyse the influences of harvesting, species traits and climate variability on the risk of collapse (decline below a fixed threshold) across 154 marine fish populations around the world. The most important factor explaining collapses was the magnitude of overfishing, while the duration of overfishing best explained long-term depletion. However, fast growth was the next most important risk factor. Fast-growing populations and those in variable environments were especially sensitive to overfishing, and the risk of collapse was more than tripled for fast-growing when compared with slow-growing species that experienced overfishing. We found little evidence that, in the absence of overfishing, climate variability or fast growth rates alone drove population collapse over the last six decades. Expanding efforts to rapidly adjust harvest pressure to account for climate-driven lows in productivity could help to avoid future collapses, particularly among fast-growing species. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Advances in genomics research have led to the development of high-quality reference genome data, genome-wide molecular markers, quantitative trait loci (QTL), and high-throughput genotyping platforms for cereal crops. The availability of these genomic resources has facilitated the development of breeding technologies such as genomics-assisted breeding (GAB). GAB is an advanced form of marker-assisted breeding where genome-wide genetic selection and high-density genotyping are performed to generate elite varieties with better agronomic traits. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) is a genotypic variation based indirect selection method that reduces the time and cost of breeding. The different approaches of MAS include marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) or introgression of agronomically important alleles or QTLs with relatively large effect, marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS) for introduction of complex traits and genomic selection (GS) based on overall molecular markers distributed throughout the genome. In view of these, the present chapter discusses the application of genetic and genomic resources in identification and mapping of stress-tolerant genes/QTLs and their application in molecular breeding. In addition, the chapter also summarizes the current status of marker-assisted selection approach for improving tolerance to drought and virus infection in major graminaceous crops. The challenges and future prospects of GAB in enhancing crop productivity under stress conditions have also been summarized. © Springer (India) Pvt. Ltd. 2017. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is a general decline of grasslands across Europe due to habitat loss and degradation. Ensuring plant dispersal thus becomes a key process for preserving grassland patches in all scales. We examined diaspore dispersal by sheep epizoochory in the pastures of the North Adriatic Karst (NW Slovenia) and determined the qualitative and quantitative features of diaspores in fur. We recorded 25,650 diaspores of 141 plant taxa (with 107 taxa and 23,350 diaspores determined to species level), using three different methods: (i) the "whole-coat method", (ii) the "part-of-thecoat method" and (iii) a "seedling emergence method". A comparison of these techniques revealed that the "wholecoat method" provided the highest number of diaspores and plant species. All diaspores were clustered into five emergent groups based on seven functional traits (diaspore weight, length, width, height, volume, specific weight and the diaspore surface structure). Our research revealed that sheep represent an important dispersal vector, since about half of the plant species recorded in the pastures were found as diaspores in fur. This study contributes to knowledge about the modes of seed dispersal in seminatural grasslands. Taking into account that livestock play a key role in vegetation dynamics, understanding their effects on seed dispersal is essential for conservation and restoration of these species-rich grassland communities. © 2016 Mitja Kaligarič et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2016.},

	abstract = {We investigate the competition between two groups of similar agents in the restricted, but classical context of unstructured populations varying in continuous time in an isolated, homogeneous, and constant abiotic environment. Individual behavioral and phenotypic traits are quantified by one-dimensional strategies and intra- as well as inter-specific interactions are described in the vicinity of a stationary regime. Some known results are revisited: invasion by a new strategy generically implies the substitution of the former resident; and resident-invader coexistence is possible close to singular strategies-the stationary points of the invasion fitness-and is generically protected-each of the two competing groups can invade the other. An (almost known) old conjecture is shown true: competition close to a singular strategy is "essentially Lotka-Volterra"-dominance of one strategy, protected coexistence at an intermediate equilibrium, and mutual exclusion are the generic outcomes. And the unfolding of the competition scenarios is completed with the analysis of three degenerate singular strategies-characterized by vanishing second-order fitness derivatives-near which resident-invader coexistence can be unprotected. Our approach is based on the series expansion of a generic demographic model, w.r.t. the small strategy difference between the two competing groups, and on known results on time-scale separation and bifurcation theories. The analysis is carried out up to third order and is extendable to any order. For each order, explicit genericity conditions under which higher orders can be neglected are derived and, interestingly, they are known prior to invasion. An important result is that degeneracies up to third-order are required to have more than one stable way of coexistence. Such degeneracies can be due to particular symmetries in the model formulation, and breaking the genericity conditions provides a direct way to draw biological interpretations. The developed body of theory is exemplified on a model for the evolution of cannibalism and on Lotka-Volterra competition models. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Shifts in the abundance and location of species are restructuring life on the Earth, presenting the need to build resilience into our natural systems. Here, we tested if protection from fishing promotes community resilience in temperate reef communities undergoing rapid warming in Tasmania. Regardless of protection status, we detected a signature of warming in the brown macroalgae, invertebrates and fishes, through increases in the local richness and abundance of warm-affinity species. Even so, responses in protected communities diverged from exploited communities. At the local scale, the number of cool-affinity fishes and canopy-forming algal species increased following protection, even though the observation window fell within a period of warming. At the same time, exploited communities gained turf algal and sessile invertebrate species. We further found that the recovery of predator populations following protection leads to marked declines in mobile invertebrates— this trend could be incorrectly attributed to warming without contextual data quantifying community change across trophic levels. By comparing long-term change in exploited and protected reefs, we empirically demonstrate the role of biological interactions in both facilitating and resisting climate-related biodiversity change. We further highlight the potential for trophic interactions to alter the progression of both range expansions and contractions. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Yet body mass, an important component of the physiological state of an organism, can affect key life-history traits and consequently population dynamics. Over the past decades, the wandering albatross-a pelagic seabird providing bi-parental care with marked sexual size dimorphism-has exhibited an increase in average body mass and breeding success in parallel with experiencing increasing wind speeds. To assess the impact of these changes, we examined how body mass affects five key life-history traits at the individual level: adult survival, breeding probability, breeding success, chick mass and juvenile survival. We found that male mass impacted all traits examined except breeding probability, whereas female mass affected none. Adult male survival increased with increasing mass. Increasing adult male mass increased breeding success and mass of sons but not of daughters. Juvenile male survival increased with their chick mass. These results suggest that a higher investment in sons by fathers can increase their inclusive fitness, which is not the case for daughters. Our study highlights sex-specific differences in the effect of body mass on the life history of a monogamous species with bi-parental care. © 2017 The Authors.},

Then the influence on the Fe(II) and Mn(II) removing efficiency by the factors, such as pH, adsorbent dosage, initial Fe(II) and Mn(II) concentration, and contact time, was investigated by the static batch test. The adsorption isotherm study results show that Langmuir equation can better fit the Fe(II) and Mn(II) adsorption process by the three adsorbents. The maximum adsorption amounts for Fe(II) were 6.211 mg/g, 4.464 mg/g, and 4.049 mg/g by RHA, ISP, and RH and for Mn(II) were 3.016 mg/g, 2.229 mg/g, and 1.889 mg/g, respectively. The adsorption kinetics results show that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model can better fit the Fe(II) and Mn(II) adsorption process. D-R model and thermodynamic parameters hint that the adsorption processes of Fe(II) and Mn(II) on the three adsorbents took place physically and the processes were feasible, spontaneous, and exothermic. © 2016 Zhao Jiang et al.},

	abstract = {Fluid-feeding insects, such as butterflies, moths and flies (20% of all animal species), are faced with the common selection pressure of having to remove and feed on trace amounts of fluids from porous surfaces. Insects able to acquire fluids that are confined to pores during drought conditions would have an adaptive advantage and increased fitness over other individuals. Here,we performed feeding trials using solutions with magnetic nanoparticles to showthat butterflies and flies have mouthparts adapted to pull liquids from porous surfaces using capillary action as the governing principle. In addition, the ability to feed on the liquids collected from pores depends on a relationship between the diameter of the mouthpart conduits and substrate pore size diameter; insects with mouthpart conduit diameters larger than the pores cannot successfully feed, thus there is a limiting substrate pore size from which each species can acquire liquids for fluid uptake. Given that natural selection independently favoured mouthpart architectures that support these methods of fluid uptake (Diptera and Lepidoptera share a common ancestor 280 Ma that had chewing mouthparts), we suggest that the convergence of this mechanism advocates this as an optimal strategy for pulling trace amounts of fluids from porous surfaces. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Plant’s life cycle involves interaction with various microorganisms in their environment. Studies are being focused to uncover the molecular components involved in plant–microbe interaction to understand the mechanism of pathogen infection or symbiosis. Recently, research studies in this area focus mainly on environmental issues to provide sustainable agriculture and to increase productivity. In this context, researchers use various high-throughput “omics” approaches which include genomics, to study the structural and functional aspects of genes and also compare the degree of gene expression in contrasting genotypes, transcriptomics that quantifies mRNA transcripts, proteomics that analyse the protein composition and metabolomics which identifies and quantifies cellular metabolites. In this chapter, we discuss the advancement of “omics” platforms, in exploring the complex metabolic networks and regulatory mechanisms during plant–microbe relationship. This has significantly improved our understanding about carbohydrate metabolism between legume plants and rhizobacteria. “Omics” platforms are being used largely in understanding and selecting efficient endophytic or beneficial strains with various improved traits like nutrient uptake, imparting abiotic and biotic stress tolerance during their interaction with host. Comparative studies by large-scale genome analysis of host and pathogen have helped in identification of various effector genes and the nature of pathogenicity induced by pathogen and also the difference in defence mechanisms amongst hosts. Climatic changes that affect the agriculture production and the ever increasing population worldwide are the two challenging factors that need to be balanced currently. In order to attain sustainable agriculture production and productivity, “omics” is a promising tool to understand the plant–microbe interaction that aid in sustainable agriculture. © Springer India 2016.},

	abstract = {Mitigation of anthropogenic climate change involves deployments of renewable energy worldwide, including wind farms, which can pose a significant collision risk to volant animals. Most studies into the collision risk between species and wind turbines, however, have taken place in industrialized countries. Potential effects for many locations and species therefore remain unclear. To redress this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of recorded collisions between birds and bats and wind turbines within developed countries. We related collision rate to species-level traits and turbine characteristics to quantify the potential vulnerability of 9538 bird and 888 bat species globally. Avian collision rate was affected by migratory strategy, dispersal distance and habitat associations, and bat collision rates were influenced by dispersal distance. For birds and bats, larger turbine capacity (megawatts) increased collision rates; however, deploying a smaller number of large turbines with greater energy output reduced total collision risk per unit energy output, although bat mortality increased again with the largest turbines. Areas with high concentrations of vulnerable species were also identified, including migration corridors. Our results can therefore guide wind farm design and location to reduce the risk of large-scale animal mortality. This is the first quantitative global assessment of the relative collision vulnerability of species groups with wind turbines, providing valuable guidance for minimizing potentially serious negative impacts on biodiversity. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Lineages tend to retain ecological characteristics of their ancestors through time. However, for some traits, selection during evolutionary history may have also played a role in determining trait values. To address the relative importance of these processes requires large-scale quantification of traits and evolutionary relationships among species. The Amazonian tree flora comprises a high diversity of angiosperm lineages and species with widely differing life-history characteristics, providing an excellent system to investigate the combined influences of evolutionary heritage and selection in determining trait variation. We used trait data related to the major axes of life-history variation among tropical trees (e.g. growth and mortality rates) from 577 inventory plots in closed-canopy forest, mapped onto a phylogenetic hypothesis spanning more than 300 genera including all major angiosperm clades to test for evolutionary constraints on traits. We found significant phylogenetic signal (PS) for all traits, consistent with evolutionarily related genera having more similar characteristics than expected by chance. Although there is also evidence for repeated evolution of pioneer and shade tolerant lifehistory strategies within independent lineages, the existence of significant PS allows clearer predictions of the links between evolutionary diversity, ecosystem function and the response of tropical forests to global change. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Communities of organisms, from mammals to microorganisms, have discontinuous distributions of body size. This pattern of size structuring is a conservative trait of community organization and is a product of processes that occur at multiple spatial and temporal scales. In this study, we assessed whether body size patterns serve as an indicator of a threshold between alternative regimes. Over the past 7000 years, the biological communities of Foy Lake (Montana, USA) have undergone a major regime shift owing to climate change. We used a palaeoecological record of diatom communities to estimate diatom sizes, and then analysed the discontinuous distribution of organism sizes over time. We used Bayesian classification and regression tree models to determine that all time intervals exhibited aggregations of sizes separated by gaps in the distribution and found a significant change in diatom body size distributions approximately 150 years before the identified ecosystem regime shift. We suggest that discontinuity analysis is a useful addition to the suite of tools for the detection of early warning signals of regime shifts. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Knowledge about transmission remains incomplete, especially concerning potential transmission in geographic areas in which it has not yet been introduced. To identify unknown vectors of Zika, we developed a data-driven model linking vector species and the Zika virus via vector-virus trait combinations that confer a propensity toward associations in an ecological network connecting flaviviruses and their mosquito vectors.

	abstract = {Background. The miracle plant, Synsepalum dulcificum (Schumach. & Thonn.) Daniell is a native African orphan crop species that has recently received increased attention due to its promise as a sweetener and source of antioxidants in both the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, a major obstacle to the species' widespread utilization is its relatively slow growth rate and prolonged juvenile period. Method. In this study, we tested twelve treatments made up of various watering regimes and exogenous nutrient application (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, at varying dosages) on the relative survival, growth, and reproductive development of 15-months-old S. dulcificum juveniles. Results. While the plants survived under most tested growing conditions, nitrogen application at doses higher than 1.5 g [seedling] -1 was found to be highly detrimental, reducing survival to 0%. The treatment was found to affect all growth traits, and juveniles that received a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (each at a rate of 1.5 g [seedling] -1), in addition to daily watering, exhibited the most vegetative growth. The simple daily provision of adequate water was found to greatly accelerate the transition to reproductive maturity in the species (from >36 months to an average of 23 months), whereas nutrient application affected the length of the reproductive phase within a season, as well as the fruiting intensity. Conclusions. This study highlights the beneficial effect of water supply and fertilization on both vegetative and reproductive growth in S. dulcificum. Water supply appeared to be the most important factor unlocking flowering in the species, while the combination of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium at the dose of 1.5 g (for all) consistently exhibited the highest performance for all growth and yield traits. These findings will help intensify S. dulcificum's breeding and horticultural development. © 2017 Tchokponhoué DA et al.},

	abstract = {Interactions among traits that build a complex structure may be represented as genetic covariation and correlation. Genetic correlations may act as constraints, deflecting the evolutionary response from the direction of natural selection. We investigated the relative importance of drift, selection, and constraints in driving skull divergence in a group of related toad species. The distributional range of these species encompasses very distinct habitats with important climatic differences and the species are primarily distinguished by differences in their skulls. Some parts of the toad skull, such as the snout, may have functional relevance in reproductive ecology, detecting water cues. Thus, we hypothesized that the species skull divergencewas driven by natural selection associated with climatic variation. However, given that all species present high correlations among skull traits, our second prediction was of high constraints deflecting the response to selection.We first extracted the main morphological direction that is expected to be subjected to selection by using within- and between-species covariance matrices. We then used evolutionary regressions to investigate whether divergence along this direction is explained by climatic variation between species. We also used quantitative genetics models to test for a role of random drift versus natural selection in skull divergence and to reconstruct selection gradients along species phylogeny. Climatic variables explained high proportions of between-species variation in the most selected axis. However, most evolutionary responses were not in the direction of selection, but aligned with the direction of allometric size, the dimension of highest phenotypic variance in the ancestral population.We conclude that toad species have responded to selection related to climate in their skulls, yet high evolutionary constraints dominated species divergence and may limit species responses to future climate change. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Vertebrates perform key roles in ecosystem processes via trophic interactions with plants and insects, but the response of these interactions to environmental change is difficult to quantify in complex systems, such as tropical forests. Here, we use the functional trait structure of Amazonian forest bird assemblages to explore the impacts of land-cover change on two ecosystem processes: seed dispersal and insect predation. We show that trait structure in assemblages of frugivorous and insectivorous birds remained stable after primary forests were subjected to logging and fire events, but that further intensification of human land use substantially reduced the functional diversity and dispersion of traits, and resulted in communities that occupied a different region of trait space. These effects were only partially reversed in regenerating secondary forests. Our findings suggest that local extinctions caused by the loss and degradation of tropical forest are non-random with respect to functional traits, thus disrupting the network of trophic interactions regulating seed dispersal by forest birds and herbivory by insects, with important implications for the structure and resilience of human-modified tropical forests. Furthermore, our results illustrate how quantitative functional traits for specific guilds can provide a range of metrics for estimating the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem processes, and the response of such processes to land-cover change. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {The energy cost of self-maintenance is a critical facet of life-history strategies. Clarifying the determinant of interspecific variation in metabolic rate (MR) at rest is important to understand and predict ecological patterns such as species distributions or responses to climatic changes. We examined variation of MR in snakes, a group characterized by a remarkable diversity of activity rates and a wide distribution. We collated previously published MR data (n = 491 observations) measured in 90 snake species at different trial temperatures. We tested for the effects of metabolic state (standard MR (SMR) versus restingMR(RMR)), foraging mode (active versus ambush foragers) and climate (temperature and precipitation) while accounting for non-independence owing to phylogeny, body mass and thermal dependence. We found that RMR was 40% higher than SMR, and that active foragers have higher MR than species that ambush their prey. We found that MR was higher in cold environments, supporting the metabolic cold adaptation hypothesis.We also found an additive and positive effect of precipitation on MR suggesting that lower MR in arid environments may decrease dehydration and energetic costs. Altogether, our findings underline the complex influences of climate and foraging mode on MR and emphasize the relevance of these facets to understand the physiological impact of climate change. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Association analysis of yield and yield-contributing traits was conducted for a barley germplasm collection consisting 107 wild (Hordeum spontaneum L.) genotypes, originating from 12 countries using 76 SSR markers. Phenotypic evaluations were performed for days to heading, plant height, number of tillers/plant, spike length, thousand kernel weight, single plant yield under well-watered and drought-stress conditions. Highly significant differences between well-watered and drought-stress conditions were observed in all measured traits. Association analysis revealed a total of 83 significant marker–trait associations for all six measured traits. The results revealed that several chromosomal regions significantly influence more than one trait, suggesting a possible existence of pleiotropic or indirect effects. The phenotypic variation explained by individual marker–trait associations ranged from 5.08 to 27.84%. The results demonstrated that wild barley is a valuable source for improving yield and yield-contributing traits for drought tolerance.

	abstract = {Interspecific competition can strongly influence the evolutionary response of a species to a changing environment, impacting the chance that the species survives or goes extinct. Previouswork has shown that when two species compete for a temporally shifting resource distribution, the species lagging behind the resource peak is the first to go extinct due to competitive exclusion. However, this work assumed symmetrically distributed resources and competition. Asymmetries can generate differences between species in population sizes, genetic variation and traitmeans. We show that asymmetric resource availability or competition can facilitate coexistence and even occasionally cause the leading species to go extinct first. Surprisingly, we also find cases where traits evolve in the opposite direction to the changing environment because of a ‘vacuum of competitive release’ created when the lagging species declines in number. Thus, the species exhibiting the slowest rate of trait evolution is not always the most likely to go extinct in a changing environment. Our results demonstrate that the extent to which species appear to be tracking environmental change and the extent to which they are preadapted to that change may not necessarily determine which species will be the winners and which will be the losers in a rapidly changing world. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Despite the anticancer capabilities of emodin observed in many cancers, including EOC, the underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. A crucial link has been discovered between the acquisition of metastatic traits and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The present study aimed to determine whether emodin could inhibit the EMT of EOC cells and explore the underlying mechanism. The CCK-8 assay and transwell assay showed that emodin effectively repressed the abilities of proliferation, invasion, and migration in A2780 and SK-OV-3 cells. The Western blot showed that emodin upregulated epithelial markers (E-cadherin and Claudin) while it downregulated mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and Vimentin) and transcription factor (Slug) in a dose-dependent fashion. After transfection of siRNA-Slug, both Slug and N-cadherin were downregulated in EOC cells while E-cadherin was upregulated, which was intensified by emodin. Besides, emodin decreased the expression of ILK, p-GSK-3β, β-catenin, and Slug. Transfection of siRNA-ILK also achieved the same effects, which was further strengthened by following emodin treatment. Nevertheless, SB216763, an inhibitor of GSK-3β, could reverse the effects of emodin except for ILK expression. These findings suggest that emodin inhibited the EMT of EOC cells via ILK/GSK-3β/Slug signaling pathway. © 2016 Jingjing Lu et al.},

	abstract = {Climate change is resulting in a radical transformation of the thermal quality of habitats across the globe. Whereas species have altered their distributions to cope with changing environments, the evidence for adaptation in response to rising temperatures is limited. However, to determine the potential of adaptation in response to thermal variation, we need estimates of the magnitude and direction of natural selection on traits that are assumed to increase persistence in warmer environments. Most inferences regarding physiological adaptation are based on interspecific analyses, and those of selection on thermal traits are scarce. Here, we estimate natural selection on major thermal traits used to assess the vulnerability of ectothermic organisms to altered thermal niches. We detected significant directional selection favouring lizards with higher thermal preferences and faster sprint performance at their optimal temperature. Our analyses also revealed correlational selection between thermal preference and critical thermal maxima, where individuals that preferred warmer body temperatures with cooler critical thermal maxima were favoured by selection. Recent published estimates of heritability for thermal traits suggest that, in concert with the strong selective pressures we demonstrate here, evolutionary adaptation may promote long-term persistence of ectotherms in altered thermal environments. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Most studies have relied on indirect evidence for its operation and have not quantified its strength relative to other macro evolutionary forces. We use an extension of the Price equation to quantify the mechanisms of body size macroevolution in mammals from the latest Palaeocene and earliest Eocene of the Bighorn and Clarks Fork Basins of Wyoming. Dwarfing of mammalian taxa across the Palaeocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), an intense, brief warming event that occurred at approximately 56 Ma, has been suggested to reflect anagenetic change and the immigration of small bodied-mammals, but might also be attributable to species selection. Using previously reconstructed ancestor– descendant relationships, we partitioned change in mean mammalian body size into three distinct mechanisms: species selection operating on resident mammals, anagenetic change within resident mammalian lineages and change due to immigrants. The remarkable decrease in mean body size across the warming event occurred through anagenetic change and immigration. Species selection also was strong across the PETM but, intriguingly, favoured larger-bodied species, implying some unknown mechanism(s) by which warming events affect macroevolution. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {The high evolutionary potential of phytoplankton species allows them to rapidly adapt to global warming. Adaptations may occur in temperaturedependent traits, such as growth rate, cell size and life cycle processes. Using resurrection experiments with resting stages from living sediment archives, it is possible to investigate whether adaptation occurred. For this study, we revived resting cysts of the spring bloom dinoflagellate Apocalathium malmogiense from recent and 100-year-old sediment layers from the Gulf of Finland, and compared temperature-dependent traits of recent and historic strains along a temperature gradient. We detected no changes in growth rates and cell sizes but a significant difference between recent and historic strains regarding resting cyst formation. The encystment rate of recent strains was significantly lower compared with historic strains which we interpret as an indication of adaptation to higher and more rapidly increasing spring temperatures. Low encystment rates may allow for bloom formation even if the threshold temperature inducing a loss of actively growing cells through resting cyst formation is exceeded. Our findings reveal that phenotypic responses of phytoplankton to changing temperature conditions may include hidden traits such as life cycle processes and their regulation mechanisms.

Tests on empirical data of theory-based predictions on the consequences of extreme climate events are thus necessary to understand the adaptive potential of species and the overarching risks associated with all aspects of climate change. We tested predictions on the genetic and life-history consequences of extreme climate events in two populations of marble trout Salmo marmoratus that have experienced severe demographic bottlenecks due to flash floods. We combined long-term field and genotyping data with pedigree reconstruction in a theory-based framework. Our results show that after flash floods, reproduction occurred at a younger age in one population. In both populations, we found the highest reproductive variance in the first cohort born after the floods due to a combination of fewer parents and higher early survival of offspring. A small number of parents allowed for demographic recovery after the floods, but the genetic bottleneck further reduced genetic diversity in both populations. Our results also elucidate some of the mechanisms responsible for a greater prevalence of faster life histories after the extreme event. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Restoration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon- (PAH-) polluted sites is presently a major challenge in agroforestry. Consequently, microorganisms with PAH-degradation ability and soil fertility improvement attributes are sought after in order to achieve sustainable remediation of polluted sites. This study isolated PAH-degrading bacteria from enriched cultures of spent automobile engine-oil polluted soil. Isolates' partial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced and taxonomically classified. Isolates were further screened for their soil fertility attributes such as phosphate solubilization, atmospheric nitrogen fixation, and indoleacetic acid (IAA) production. A total of 44 isolates were obtained and belong to the genera Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Flavobacterium, Microbacterium, Ochrobactrum, Pseudomonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, Rhodococcus, and Stenotrophomonas. Data analysed by principal component analysis showed the Bacillus and Ochrobactrum isolates displayed outstanding IAA production. Generalized linear modelling statistical approaches were applied to evaluate the contribution of the four most represented genera (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, and Rhodococcus) to soil fertility. The Pseudomonas isolates were the most promising in all three soil fertility enhancement traits evaluated and all isolates showed potential for one or more of the attributes evaluated. These findings demonstrate a clear potential of the isolates to participate in restorative bioremediation of polluted soil, which will enhance sustainable agricultural production and environmental protection. © 2016 Maryam Bello-Akinosho et al.},

	abstract = {Environmental change may cause phenotypic changes that are inherited across generations through transgenerational plasticity (TGP). If TGP is adaptive, offspring fitness increases with an increasing match between parent and offspring environment. Here we test for adaptive TGP in somatic growth and metabolic rate in response to temperature in the clonal zooplankton Daphnia pulex. Animals of the first focal generation experienced thermal transgenerational ‘mismatch’ (parental and offspring temperatures differed), whereas conditions of the next two generations matched the (grand)maternal thermal conditions. Adjustments of metabolic rate occurred during the lifetime of the first generation (i.e. within-generation plasticity). However, no further change was observed during the subsequent two generations, as would be expected under TGP. Furthermore, we observed no tendency for increased juvenile somatic growth (a trait highly correlated with fitness in Daphnia) over the three generations when reared at new temperatures. These results are inconsistent with existing studies of thermal TGP, and we describe how previous experimental designs may have confounded TGP with within-generation plasticity and selective mortality. We suggest that the current evidence for thermal TGP is weak. To increase our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary role of TGP, future studies should more carefully identify possible confounding factors. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Improved understanding is essential for assessing the value of biodiversity and predicting the effects of change (including in biodiversity) on these ecosystems and the services they maintain. Here we focus on the trophic interactions that underpin ecosystem structure, developing comparative analyses of how polar pelagic food webs vary in relation to the environment. We highlight that there is not a singular, generic Arctic or Antarctic pelagic food web, and, although there are characteristic pathways of energy flow dominated by a small number of species, alternative routes are important for maintaining energy transfer and resilience. These more complex routes cannot, however, provide the same rate of energy flow to highest trophiclevel species. Food-web structure may be similar in different regions, but the individual species that dominate mid-trophic levels vary across polar regions. The characteristics (traits) of these species are also different and these differences influence a range of food-web processes. Low functional redundancy at key trophic levels makes these ecosystems particularly sensitive to change. To develop models for projecting responses of polar ecosystems to future environmental change, we propose a conceptual frame-work that links the life histories of pelagic species and the structure of polar food webs. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolutionary responses of organisms to thermal regimes is of prime importance to better predict their ability to cope with ongoing climate change. Although this question has attracted interest in free-living organisms, whether or not infectious diseases have evolved heterogeneous responses to climate is still an open question. Here, we ran a common garden experiment using the fish ectoparasite Tracheliastes polycolpus, (i) to test whether parasites living in thermally heterogeneous rivers respond differently to an experimental thermal gradient and (ii) to determine the evolutionary processes (natural selection or genetic drift) underlying these responses. We demonstrated that the reaction norms involving the survival rate of the parasite larvae (i.e. the infective stage) across a temperature gradient significantly varied among six parasite populations. Using a Qst/Fst approach and phenotype–environment associations, we further showed that the evolution of survival rate partly depended upon temperature regimes experienced in situ, and was mostly underlined by diversifying selection, but also—to some extent—by stabilizing selection and genetic drift. This evolutionary response led to population divergences in thermal tolerance across the landscape, which has implications for predicting the effects of future climate change. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {A common practice in thermal biology is to take individuals directly from the field and estimate a range of thermal traits. These estimates are then used in studies aiming to understand broad scale distributional patterns, understanding and predicting the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, and generating predictions for climate change risk. However, the use of field-caught individuals in such studies ignores the fact that many traits are phenotypically plastic and will be influenced by the thermal history of the focal individuals. The current study aims to determine the extent to which estimates of upper thermal limits (CTmax), a frequently used measure for climate change risk, are sensitive to developmental and adult acclimation temperatures and whether these two forms of plasticity are reversible. Examining a temperate and tropical population of Drosophila melanogaster we show that developmental acclimation has a larger and more lasting effect on CTmax than adult acclimation. We also find evidence for an interaction between developmental and adult acclimation, particularly when flies are acclimated for a longer period, and that these effects can be population specific. These results suggest that thermal history can have lasting effects on estimates of CTmax. In addition, we provide evidence that developmental and/or adult acclimation are unlikely to contribute to substantial shifts in CTmax and that acclimation capacity may be constrained at higher temperatures. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Specifically, carbonyls cause an increase in viscosity (often referred to as 'aging') during storage of bio-oils. As such, carbonyl content has previously been used as a method of tracking bio-oil aging and condensation reactions with less variability than viscosity measurements. Additionally, carbonyls are also responsible for coke formation in bio-oil upgrading processes. Given the importance of carbonyls in bio-oils, accurate analytical methods for their quantification are very important for the bio-oil community. Potentiometric titration methods based on carbonyl oximation have long been used for the determination of carbonyl content in pyrolysis bio-oils. Here, we present a modification of the traditional carbonyl oximation procedures that results in less reaction time, smaller sample size, higher precision, and more accurate carbonyl determinations. While traditional carbonyl oximation methods occur at room temperature, the Faix method presented here occurs at an elevated temperature of 80 °C. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

These latitudinal differences could increase species richness at low latitudes, but that increase may be largely cryptic, because physiological and dispersal traits isolating populations might not correspond to morphological differences. Yet previous tests of the MPHT hypothesis have not addressed cryptic diversity. We use integrative taxonomy, combining morphology (6136 specimens) and DNA barcoding (1832 specimens) to compare the species richness, cryptic diversity and elevational ranges of mayflies (Ephemeroptera) in the Rocky Mountains (Colorado; approx. 408N) and the Andes (Ecuador; approx. 08). We find higher species richness and smaller elevational ranges in Ecuador than Colorado, but only after quantifying and accounting for cryptic diversity. The opposite pattern is found when comparing diversity based on morphology alone, underscoring the importance of uncovering cryptic species to understand global biodiversity patterns. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Mutation has a fundamental influence over evolutionary processes, but how evolutionary processes shape mutation rate remains less clear. In asexual unicellular organism, increased mutation rates have been observed in stressful environments and the reigning paradigm ascribes this increase to selection for evolvability. However, this explanation does not apply in sexually reproducing species, where little is known about how the environment affects mutation rate. Here we challenged experimental lines of seed beetle, evolved at ancestral temperature or under simulated climate warming, to repair induced mutations at ancestral and stressful temperature. Results show that temperature stress causes individuals to pass on a greater mutation load to their grand-offspring. This suggests that stress-induced mutation rates, in unicellular and multicellular organisms alike, can result from compromised germline DNA repair in low condition individuals. Moreover, lines adapted to simulated climate warming had evolved increased longevity at the cost of reproduction, and this allocation decision improved germline repair. These results suggest that mutation rates can be modulated by resource allocation trade-offs encompassing life-history traits and the germline and have important implications for rates of adaptation and extinction as well as our understanding of genetic diversity in multicellular organisms. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

	abstract = {The responses of lowland tropical communities to climate change will critically influence global biodiversity but remain poorly understood. If species in these systems are unable to toleratewarming, the communities—currently the most diverse on Earth—may become depauperate (‘biotic attrition’). In response to temperature changes, animals can adjust their distribution in space or their activity in time, but these two components of the niche are seldom considered together.We assessed the spatio-temporal niches of rainforestmammal species in Borneo across gradients in elevation and temperature. Most species are not predicted to experience changes in spatio-temporal niche availability, even under pessimistic warming scenarios. Responses to temperature are not predictable by phylogeny but do appear to be trait-based, being much more variable in smaller-bodied taxa. General circulation models and weather station data suggest unprecedentedly high midday temperatures later in the century; predicted responses to this warming among small-bodied species range from 9% losses to 6% gains in spatio-temporal niche availability, while larger species have close to 0% predicted change. Body mass may therefore be a key ecological trait influencing the identity of climate change winners and losers. Mammal species composition will probably change in some areas as temperatures rise, but full-scale biotic attrition this century appears unlikely. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {A fragmented habitat becomes increasingly fragmented for species at higher trophic levels, such as parasitoids. To persist, these species are expected to possess life-history traits, such as high dispersal, that facilitate their ability to use resources that become scarce in fragmented landscapes. If a specialized parasitoid disperses widely to take advantage of a sparse host, then the parasitoid population should have lower genetic structure than the host. We investigated the temporal and spatial genetic structure of a hyperparasitoid (fourth trophic level) in a fragmented landscape over 50 × 70 km, using microsatellite markers, and compared it with the known structures of its host parasitoid, and the butterfly host which lives as a classic metapopulation. We found that population genetic structure decreases with increasing trophic level. The hyperparasitoid has fewer genetic clusters (K = 4), than its host parasitoid (K = 15), which in turn is less structured than the host butterfly (K = 27). The genetic structure of the hyperparasitoid also shows temporal variation, with genetic differentiation increasing due to reduction of the population size, which reduces the effective population size. Overall, our study confirms the idea that specialized species must be dispersive to use a fragmented host resource, but that this adaptation has limits. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Given that these hidden contrasting signals may confer additional survival benefits to the prey by startling/intimidating predators, it is unclear why they have evolved in some species, but not in others. Here, we have conducted a comparative phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of colour traits in the family Erebidae (Lepidoptera), and found that the hidden contrasting colour signals are more likely to be found in larger species. To understand why this relationship occurs, we present a general mathematical model, demonstrating that selection for a secondary defence such as deimatic display will be stronger in large species when (i) the primary defence (crypsis) is likely to fail as its body size increases and/or (ii) the secondary defence is more effective in large prey. To test the model assumptions, we conducted behavioural experiments using a robotic moth which revealed that survivorship advantages were higher against wild birds when the moth has contrasting hindwings and large size. Collectively, our results suggest that the evolutionary association between large size and hidden contrasting signals has been driven by a combination of the need for a back-up defence and its efficacy. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This complex multi-dimensional amalgam of inputs enables continuous adjustment of root growth rates, direction, and metabolic activity that define a dynamic physical network. Current methods for analyzing root biology balance physiological relevance with imaging capability. To bridge this divide, we developed an integratedimaging system called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots) that uses luminescence-based reporters to enable studies of root architecture and gene expression patterns in soil-grown, light-shielded roots. We have developed image analysis algorithms that allow the spatial integration of soil properties, gene expression, and root system architecture traits. We propose GLO-Roots as a system that has great utility in presenting environmental stimuli to roots in ways that evoke natural adaptive responses and in providing tools for studying the multi-dimensional nature of such processes. © Rellán-Álvarez et al.},

	abstract = {Identifying patterns in the effects of temperature on species' population abundances could help develop a general framework for predicting the consequences of climate change across different communities and realms. We used long-term population time series data from terrestrial, freshwater, and marine species communitieswithin central Europe to compare the effects of temperature on abundance across a broad range of taxonomic groups.We askedwhether there was anaverage relationship betweentemperatures in different seasons andannual abundances of species in a community, and whether species attributes (temperature range of distribution, range size, habitat breadth, dispersal ability, body size, and lifespan) explained interspecific variation in the relationship between temperature and abundance. We found that, on average, warmer winter temperatureswere associatedwith greater abundances in terrestrial communities (ground beetles, spiders, and birds) but not always in aquatic communities (freshwater and marine invertebrates and fish). The abundances of species with large geographical ranges, larger body sizes, and longer lifespans tended to be less related to temperature. Our results suggest that climate changemay have, in general, positive effects on species' abundanceswithinmany terrestrial communities in central Europe while the effects are less predictable in aquatic communities. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Gaining insight into the ability of tree populations to evolve pest, disease, and drought resistance is of major importance with regard to the conservation of adaptive tree genetic resource variation under global change. However, the longevity of tree species challenges accurate assessment of additive genetic variation driving trait evolution through common garden experiments and pedigree-informed quantitative genetic analyses. Here, we argue that recent developments in landscape and population genomics pave the way for molecular marker-based analysis of evolutionary potential as a more time and cost-efficient alternative. Focusing on phenotype- or ecology-informed molecular markers increases the per-marker contribution to the genetic variation underpinning phenotypic trait evolution. Considering that most tree species lack a reference genome, landscape genomic analysis of anonymous markers can be used in concert with in situ and ex situ phenotypic monitoring of tree populations to quantify tree adaptive potential. Global forest restoration efforts and strategies to conserve tree genetic resources are likely to benefit considerably from marker-based insights in the spatial distribution of tree adaptive genetic diversity. © 2017.

	abstract = {Ant-gardens (AGs) are ant/plant mutualisms in which ants farm epiphytes in return for nest space and food rewards. They occur in the Neotropics and Australasia, but not in Africa, and their evolutionary assembly remains unclear. We here use phylogenetic frameworks for important AG lineages in Australasia, namely the ant genus Philidris and domatium-bearing ferns (Lecanopteris) and flowering plants in the Apocynaceae (Hoya and Dischidia) and Rubiaceae (Myrmecodia, Hydnophytum, Anthorrhiza, Myrmephytum and Squamellaria). Our analyses revealed that in these clades, diaspore dispersal by ants evolved at least 13 times, five times in the Late Miocene and Pliocene in Australasia and seven times during the Pliocene in Southeast Asia, after Philidris ants had arrived there, with subsequent dispersal between these two areas. A uniquely specialized AG system evolved in Fiji at the onset of the Quaternary. The farming in the same AG of epiphytes that do not offer nest spaces suggests that a broadening of the ants’ plant host spectrum drove the evolution of additional domatium-bearing AG-epiphytes by selecting on pre-adapted morphological traits. Consistent with this, we found a statistical correlation between the evolution of diaspore dispersal by ants and domatia in all three lineages. Our study highlights how host broadening by a symbiont has led to new farming mutualisms. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {One of the main environmental threats in the tropics is selective logging, which has degraded large areas of forest. In southeast Asia, enrichment planting with seedlings of the dominant group of dipterocarp tree species aims to accelerate restoration of forest structure and functioning. The role of tree diversity in forest restoration is still unclear, but the ‘insurance hypothesis’ predicts that in temporally and spatially varying environments planting mixtures may stabilize functioning owing to differences in species traits and ecologies. To test for potential insurance effects, we analyse the patterns of seedling mortality and growth in monoculture and mixture plots over the first decade of the Sabah biodiversity experiment. Our results reveal the species differences required for potential insurance effects including a trade-off in which species with denser wood have lower growth rates but higher survival. This trade-offwas consistent over time during the first decade, but growth and mortality varied spatially across our 500 ha experiment with species responding to changing conditions in different ways. Overall, average survival rates were extreme in monocultures than mixtures consistent with a potential insurance effect in which monocultures of poorly surviving species risk recruitment failure, whereas monocultures of species with high survival have rates of selfthinning that are potentially wasteful when seedling stocks are limited. Longer-term monitoring as species interactions strengthen will be needed to more comprehensively test to what degree mixtures of species spread risk and use limited seedling stocks more efficiently to increase diversity and restore ecosystem structure and functioning. © 2016 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Humans can acquire new information and modify it (cumulative culture) based on their learning and memory abilities, especially explicit memory, through the processes of encoding, consolidation, storage, and retrieval. Explicit memory is categorized into semantic and episodic memories. Animals have semantic memory, while episodic memory is unique to humans and essential for innovation and the evolution of culture. As both episodic and semantic memory are needed for innovation, the evolution of explicit memory influences the evolution of culture. However, previous theoretical studies have shown that environmental fluctuations influence the evolution of imitation (social learning) and innovation (individual learning) and assume that memory is not an evolutionary trait. If individuals can store and retrieve acquired information properly, they can modify it and innovate new information. Therefore, being able to store and retrieve information is essential from the perspective of cultural evolution. However, if both storage and retrieval were too costly, forgetting and relearning would have an advantage over storing and retrieving acquired information. In this study, using mathematical analysis and individual-based simulations, we investigate whether cumulative culture can promote the coevolution of costly memory and social and individual learning, assuming that cumulative culture improves the fitness of each individual. The conclusions are: (1) without cumulative culture, a social learning cost is essential for the evolution of storage-retrieval. Costly storage-retrieval can evolve with individual learning but costly social learning does not evolve. When low-cost social learning evolves, the repetition of forgetting and learning is favored more than the evolution of costly storage-retrieval, even though a cultural trait improves the fitness. (2) When cumulative culture exists and improves fitness, storage-retrieval can evolve with social and/or individual learning, which is not influenced by the degree of the social learning cost. Whether individuals socially learn a low level of culture from observing a high or the low level of culture influences the evolution of memory and learning, especially individual learning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

We combine recent (1960-2010) climate and phenotypic data with microclimate, heat balance, demographic and evolutionary models to address this issue for a montane butterfly, Colias eriphyle, along an elevational gradient. Our focal phenotype, wing solar absorptivity, responds plastically to developmental (pupal) temperatures and plays a central role in thermoregulatory adaptation in adults. Here, we show that both the phenotypic and adaptive consequences of plasticity vary with elevation. Seasonal changes in weather generate seasonal variation in phenotypic selection on mean and plasticity of absorptivity, especially at lower elevations. In response to climate change in the past 60 years, our models predict evolutionary declines in mean absorptivity (but little change in plasticity) at high elevations, and evolutionary increases in plasticity (but little change in mean) at low elevation. The importance of plasticity depends on the magnitude of seasonal variation in climate relative to interannual variation. Our results suggest that selection and evolution of both trait means and plasticity can contribute to adaptive response to climate change in this system. They also illustrate how plasticity can facilitate rather than retard adaptive evolutionary responses to directional climate change in seasonal environments. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Morphological, behavioural and physiological traits that characterize dispersive individuals from residents are poorly understood for many invertebrate systems, especially in nonpolymorphic pterygote species. Here we examined phenotypic differences between dispersal-prone and philopatric individuals from repeated markrelease-recapture (MRR) experiments using an invasive agricultural pest, Ceratitis capitata. Comprehensive morphometric assessment and subsequent minimal adequate modelling using an information theoretic approach identified thorax mass: body mass ratio as a key predictor of disperser flies under semi-natural conditions. Performance differences in flight ability were then examined under controlled laboratory conditions to assess whether greater thorax mass: body mass ratio was associated with enhanced flight ability. The larger thorax: body mass ratio was associated with measurable differences in mean flight duration, most predominantly in males, and also by their willingness to disperse, scored as the number and duration of voluntary flights. No other measures of whole-animal flight performance (e.g. mean and peak vertical force, total or maximum flight duration) differed. Variation in voluntary behaviour may result in significant alterations of movement behaviour and realized dispersal in nature. This phenomenon may help explain intraspecific variation in the dispersal ability of insects. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Climate change has a strong impact on phytoplankton communities and water quality. However, the development of robust techniques to assess phytoplankton growth is still in progress. In this study, the growth rate of phytoplankton cells grown at different temperatures was modelled based on conventional physiological traits (e.g. chlorophyll, carbon and photosynthetic parameters) using the partial least square regression (PLSR) algorithm and compared with a new approach combining Fourier transform infrared-spectroscopy and PLSR. In this second model, it is assumed that the macromolecular composition of phytoplankton cells represents an intracellular marker for growth. The models have comparable high predictive power (R2. 0.8) and low error in predicting new observations. Interestingly, not all of the predictors present the same weight in the modelling of growth rate. A set of specific parameters, such as non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) and the quantum yield of carbon production in the first model, and lipid, protein and carbohydrate contents for the second one, strongly covary with cell growth rate regardless of the taxonomic position of the phytoplankton species investigated. This reflects a set of specific physiological adjustments covarying with growth rate, conserved among taxonomically distant algal species that might be used as guidelines for the improvement of modern primary production models. The high predictive power of both sets of cellular traits for growth rate is of great importance for applied phycological studies.

	abstract = {Climatic variations during the Quaternary period had a considerable impact on landscapes and habitat fragmentation (rivers) in North Africa. These historical events can have significant consequences on the genetic structure of the populations. Indeed, geographi-cally separated and genetically isolated populations tend to differentiate themselves through time, eventually becoming distinct lineages, allowing new species to emerge in later generations. The aim of the present study is to use genetic and morphological techniques to evaluate the major role of the Saalian glaciation (Middle Quaternary) in the establishment of the geographic space and in the evolution of the intraspecific genetic diversity, by tracing the demographic history of barbels belonging to the Luciobarbus pallaryi (Cyprinidae) species in the Guir Basin (Algeria). In this context, two populations, from two distinct and isolated sites, were studied. Analysis of the cytochrome b (cyt b) mitochondrial markers and of the "D-loop" control region has shown that the "upstream" and "downstream" Guir populations are genetically differentiated. The molecular analyses suggest that the upstream population was disconnected from this hydrographic system during the Saalian glaciation period of the Quaternary. Subsequently, it was isolated in the foggaras underground waters in the Great Western Erg, at approximately 320 000 years BP, creating, through a bottleneck effect, a new allopatric lineage referred to as "Adrar". Conversely, the high genetic diversity in the upstream Guir (Bechar) population suggests that the stock is globally in expansion. These barbels (n = 52) were also examined with meristic, morphometric, osteological, and biological features. © Académie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.},

	abstract = {Malaria transmission is known to be strongly impacted by temperature. The current understanding of how temperature affects mosquito and parasite life history traits derives from a limited number of empirical studies. These studies, some dating back to the early part of last century, are often poorly controlled, have limited replication, explore a narrow range of temperatures, and use a mixture of parasite and mosquito species. Here, we use a single pairing of the Asian mosquito vector, An. stephensi and the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the thermal performance curves of a range of mosquito and parasite traits relevant to transmission. We show that biting rate, adult mortality rate, parasite development rate, and vector competence are temperature sensitive. Importantly, we find qualitative and quantitative differences to the assumed temperature-dependent relationships. To explore the overall implications of temperature for transmission, we first use a standard model of relative vectorial capacity. This approach suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 29°C, with minimum and maximum temperatures of 12°C and 38°C, respectively. However, the robustness of the vectorial capacity approach is challenged by the fact that the empirical data violate several of the model’s simplifying assumptions. Accordingly, we present an alternative model of relative force of infection that better captures the observed biology of the vector–parasite interaction. This model suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 26°C, with a minimum and maximum of 17°C and 35°C, respectively. The differences between the models lead to potentially divergent predictions for the potential impacts of current and future climate change on malaria transmission. The study provides a framework for more detailed, system-specific studies that are essential to develop an improved understanding on the effects of temperature on malaria transmission. © 2017 Shapiro et al.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic environments are a dominant feature of the modern world; therefore, understanding which traits allow animals to succeed in these urban environments is especially important. Overall, generalist species are thought to be most successful in urban environments, with better general cognition and less neophobia as suggested critical traits. It is less clear, however, which traits would be favoured in urban environments in highly specialized species. Here, we compared highly specialized food-caching mountain chickadees living in an urban environment (Reno, NV, USA) with those living in their natural environment to investigate what makes this species successful in the city. Using a ‘common garden’ paradigm, we found that urban mountain chickadees tended to explore a novel environment faster and moved more frequently, were better at novel problem-solving, had better long-term spatial memory retention and had a larger telencephalon volume compared with forest chickadees. There were no significant differences between urban and forest chickadees in neophobia, food-caching rates, spatial memory acquisition, hippocampus volume, or the total number of hippocampal neurons. Our results partially support the idea that some traits associated with behavioural flexibility and innovation are associated with successful establishment in urban environments, but differences in long-term spatial memory retention suggest that even this trait specialized for food-caching may be advantageous. Our results highlight the importance of environmental context, species biology, and temporal aspects of invasion in understanding how urban environments are associated with behavioural and cognitive phenotypes and suggest that there is likely no one suite of traits that makes urban animals successful. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Cohort effects can be a major source of heterogeneity and play an important role in population dynamics. Silver-spoon effects, when environmental quality at birth improves future performance regardless of the adult environment, can induce strong lagged responses on population growth. Alternatively, the external predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis predicts that organisms will adjust their developmental trajectory and physiology during early life in anticipation of expected adult conditions but has rarely been assessed in wild species. We used over 40 years of detailed individual monitoring of bighorn ewes (Ovis canadensis) to quantify longterm cohort effects on survival and reproduction. We then tested both the silver-spoon and the PAR hypotheses. Cohort effects involved a strong interaction between birth and current environments: reproduction and survival were lowest for ewes that were born and lived at high population densities. This interaction, however, does not support the PAR hypothesis because individuals with matching high-density birth and adult environments had reduced fitness. Instead, individuals born at high density had overall lower lifetime fitness suggesting a silver-spoon effect. Early-life conditions can induce long-term changes in fitness components, and their effects on cohort fitness vary according to adult environment. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Biological processes operating on coral reef frameworks remain largely unknown from naturally high-carbon-dioxide (CO2) ecosystems. For the first time, we independently quantified the response of multiple functional groups instrumental in the construction and erosion of these frameworks (accretion, macroboring, microboring, and grazing) along natural OA gradients. We deployed blocks of dead coral skeleton for roughly 2 years at two reefs in Papua New Guinea, each experiencing volcanically enriched CO2, and employed high-resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to create three-dimensional models of changing skeletal structure. OA conditions were correlated with decreased calcification and increased macroboring, primarily by annelids, representing a group of bioeroders not previously known to respond to OA. Incubation of these blocks, using the alkalinity anomaly methodology, revealed a switch from net calcification to net dissolution at a pH of roughly 7.8, within Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) predictions for global ocean waters by the end of the century. Together these data represent the first comprehensive experimental study of bioerosion and calcification from a naturally high-CO2 reef ecosystem, where the processes of accelerated erosion and depressed calcification have combined to alter the permanence of this essential framework habitat. © 2016 The Authors.

Although native species occur across all continents, the factors influencing their distribution are poorly known.

Our analyses showed that Reticulitermes split from Heterotermes + Coptotermes at 59.5 Ma (49.9–69.5 Ma 95% CI), yet the oldest split within Reticulitermes (Eurasia and North America) is 16.1 Ma (13.4–19.5 Ma) and the oldest split within Heterotermes + Coptotermes is 36.0 Ma (33.9–40.5 Ma). We detected 14 disjunctions between biogeographical realms, all of which occurred within the last 34 Ma, not only after the break-up of Pangaea, but also with the continents in similar to current positions. Land dispersal over land bridges explained four disjunctions, oceanic dispersal by wood rafting explained eight disjunctions, and human introduction was the source of two recent disjunctions. These wood-eating termites, therefore, appear to have acquired their modern worldwide distribution through multiple dispersal processes, with oceanic dispersal and human introduction favoured by the ecological traits of nesting in wood and producing replacement reproductives. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This invasion caused precipitous declines in zooplankton prey (Daphnia pulicaria), with cascading impacts on ecosystem services (water clarity). Here, we tested the link between Bythotrephes invasion, evolution in Daphnia and post-invasion ecological dynamics using 15 years of long-term data in conjunction with comparative experiments. Invasion by Bythotrephes is associated with rapid increases in the body size of Daphnia. Laboratory experiments revealed that such shifts have a genetic component; third-generation laboratory-reared Daphnia from ‘invaded’ lakes are significantly larger and exhibit greater reproductive effort than individuals from ‘uninvaded’ lakes. This trajectory of evolution should accelerate Daphnia population growth and enhance population persistence. We tested this prediction by comparing analyses of long-term data with laboratory-based simulations, and show that rapid evolution in Daphnia is associated with increased population growth in invaded lakes. © 2017 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to biodiversity, yet separating their effects is challenging. We use a multi-trophic, trait-based, and spatially explicit general ecosystem model to examine the independent and synergistic effects of these processes on ecosystem structure. We manipulated habitat by removing plant biomass in varying spatial extents, intensities, and configurations.We found that emergent synergistic interactions of loss and fragmentation aremajor determinants of ecosystemresponse, including population declines and trophic pyramid shifts. Furthermore, trait-mediated interactions, such as a disproportionate sensitivity of large-sized organismsto fragmentation, produce significant effects in shaping responses. We also show that top-down regulation mitigates the effects of land use on plant biomass loss, suggesting that models lacking these interactions-including most carbon stock models- may not adequately capture land-use change impacts. Our results have important implications for understanding ecosystem responses to environmental change, and assessing the impacts of habitat fragmentation. © 2016 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Species are linked to each other by a myriad of positive and negative interactions. This complex spectrum of interactions constitutes a network of links that mediates ecological communities’ response to perturbations, such as exploitation and climate change. In the last decades, there have been great advances in the study of intricate ecological networks. We have, nonetheless, lacked both the data and the tools to more rigorously understand the patterning of multiple interaction types between species (i.e., “multiplex networks”), as well as their consequences for community dynamics. Using network statistical modeling applied to a comprehensive ecological network, which includes trophic and diverse non-trophic links, we provide a first glimpse at what the full “entangled bank” of species looks like. The community exhibits clear multidimensional structure, which is taxonomically coherent and broadly predictable from species traits. Moreover, dynamic simulations suggest that this non-random patterning of how diverse non-trophic interactions map onto the food web could allow for higher species persistence and higher total biomass than expected by chance and tends to promote a higher robustness to extinctions. © 2016 Kéfi et al.},

	abstract = {Climate warming can destabilize interactions between competitors as smaller organisms gain advantages in warmer environments. Whether and how warming-induced effects on competitive interactions are modified by predation remains unknown. We hypothesized that predation will offset the competitive advantage of smaller prey species in warmer environments because of their greater vulnerability to predation. To test this, we assembled a litter arthropod community with two Collembola species (Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta) of different body sizes across a temperature gradient (three thermal environments) and in the presence and absence of predatory mites. Predatory mites reduced Collembola coexistence with increasing temperatures. Contradicting our hypothesis, the larger prey species always outperformed the smaller prey species in warmer environments with predators. Larger prey probably benefited as they expressed a greater trait (body length) plasticity to warming. Warming can thus magnify predation effects and reduce the probability of prey coexistence. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The author of this article and colleagues earlier reported the role played by rhizosphere bacterial antagonists, Bacillus subtilis PFMRI and Paenibacillus macerans PF9, as bioprotectant and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRB). Since the strains were isolated from the rhizosphere, a diverse and complex environment, it was hypothesized that the strains that are able to survive in such competitive environment could be of potential source of multiple hydrolytic enzymes with ability to biodegrade macromolecules as well. Accordingly, a number of hydrolytic enzymes of the two strains were extracted using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), pectin, starch and birchwood xylan as substrates and comparatively analysed for their respective catalytic activities and enzyme kinetics. Consequently, a number of hydrolytic enzymes, namely, cellulase, pectinase, xylanase and amylase, with important physiochemical properties were extracted from B. subtilis PFMRI and P. macerans PF9. Accordingly, the optimal pH and temperature of enzymes from the former strain were found to vary from 5.0 to 9.0 and 50 oC to 65 oC, while for the ones from the latter, strain varied from 5.5 to 9.0 and 40 oC to 55 oC, respectively, whereas the maximum velocity (Vmax), the amount substrate needed to reach half Vmax (Km) and the time needed to reach half Vmax under optimal condition (Kmt) for enzymes from the former strain varied from 1128.64 to 13241.86 μmol.min-1. L-1, 1.81 to 205.1 mM and 0.19 to 8.04 min, while for the ones from the latter strain, values varied from 3565.10 to 15366.68 μmol.min-1.L-1, 6.1 to 114.6 mM and 1.54 to 2.86 min, respectively. The present study is the first of its kind in reporting the bioprospecting of multiple hydrolytic enzymes from bacterial antagonists for biodegradation of macromolecules. Accordingly, a number of hydrolytic enzymes stable at elevated temperatures and pH extremes as well as with higher catalytic dynamics and substrate affinity were identified. Besides, it is anticipated that the new parameter, Kmt, would help us know the time limit of an enzymatic reaction and manipulate the reaction as needed. Thus, such enzymes would be of potential role in the white industry. Yet, further study should be conducted to reverse engineer and work on heterologous expression of such enzymes so as to manipulate them for improved physiochemical as well as kinetic traits. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

During carcinoma progression, phenotypic plasticity drives invasion, dissemination and metastasis. Indeed, while most of the studies of phenotypic plasticity have been in the context of epithelial-derived carcinomas, it turns out sarcomas, which are mesenchymal in origin, also exhibit phenotypic plasticity, with a subset of sarcomas undergoing a phenomenon that resembles a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Here, we developed a method comprising the miR-200 family and grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) to mimic this MET-like phenomenon observed in sarcoma patient samples.We sequentially express GRHL2 and the miR-200 family using cell transduction and transfection, respectively, to better understand the molecular underpinnings of these phenotypic transitions in sarcoma cells. Sarcoma cells expressing miR-200s and GRHL2 demonstrated enhanced epithelial characteristics in cell morphology and alteration of epithelial and mesenchymal biomarkers. Future studies using these methods can be used to better understand the phenotypic consequences of MET-like processes on sarcoma cells, such as migration, invasion, metastatic propensity, and therapy resistance. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

Diverse methods like use of plants with natural tolerance or plants with modified tolerance by use of stress-related genes are available for alleviation of such stresses. Nevertheless, the use of rhizospheric microorganisms having plant growth-promoting traits has also been proved to be effective under stressful conditions. Such microbes can symbiotically or non-symbiotically alleviate the effects of stress and enhance plant growth. Therefore, diverse microbial species and strains are isolated, screened, tested, and used as microbial inoculums worldwide. The vast influence of rhizospheric microbes toward the growth and production of crop plants can be environmentally and economically significant.

We attached acceleration loggers to Imperial cormorants Phalacrocorax atriceps and Magellanic penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, both foraging in waters over the Patagonian Shelf, to examine the difference in movement between their respective heads and bodies in an attempt to explain this dichotomy. The penguins had head and body attitudes and movements that broadly concurred throughout all phases of their dives. By contrast, although the cormorants followed this pattern during the descent and ascent phases of dives, during the bottom (foraging) phase of the dive, the head angle differed widely from that of the body and its dynamism (measured using vectorial dynamic acceleration) was over four times greater. A simple model indicated that having the head on an extended neck would allow these cormorants to half the energy expenditure that they would expend if their body moved in the way their heads did. This apparently energy-saving solution is likely to lead to greater heat loss though and would seem tenable in slow-swimming species because the loss of streamlining that it engenders would make it detrimental for fast-swimming taxa such as penguins. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Mycoparasitism is a lifestyle where a living fungus (host or prey) is parasitized by and acts as a nutrient source of another fungus (mycoparasite or predator). Mycoparasitic interactions are common among fungi and, similar to plant pathogens, comprise both biotrophic as well as necrotrophic relationships. Biotrophic mycoparasites obtain their nutrition from living fungal host hyphae, with which they can live in a balanced relationship for extended stages of their life cycles, and usually show a narrow host range (1). Because of their nature, however, only few species are studied in detail and applied as biocontrol agents. Examples are Ampelomyces quisqualis (Ascomycota, Pezizomycotina), a natural enemy of powdery mildews, whose genome sequence has recently been released, as well as haustorial biotrophs from the Zygomycota (2, 3). In contrast to biotrophs, necrotrophic mycoparasites are more destructive and often rather unspecialized (4). They usually have wide host ranges, often comprising fungal plant pathogens, and kill their fungal prey by invasion and secretion of damaging molecules followed by feeding on the released nutrients (5, 6). These traits render these fungi useful in agriculture for the biological control of plant diseases. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sex ratio and sexual dimorphism have long been of interest in population and evolutionary ecology, but consequences for communities and ecosystems remain untested. Sex ratio could influence ecological conditions whenever sexual dimorphism is associated with ecological dimorphism in species with strong ecological interactions. We tested for ecological implications of sex ratio variation in the sexually dimorphic western mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis. This species causes strong pelagic trophic cascades and exhibits substantial variation in adult sex ratios. We found that female-biased populations induced stronger pelagic trophic cascades compared with male-biased populations, causing larger changes to key community and ecosystem responses, including zooplankton abundance, phytoplankton abundance, productivity, pH and temperature. The magnitude of such effects indicates that sex ratio is important for mediating the ecological role of mosquitofish. Because both sex ratio variation and sexual dimorphism are common features of natural populations, our findings should encourage broader consideration of the ecological significance of sex ratio variation in nature, including the relative contributions of various sexually dimorphic traits to these effects. © 2015, The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {The trophic flow of a species is considered a characteristic trait reflecting its trophic position and function in the ecosystem and its interaction with the environment. However, climate patterns are changing and we ignore how patterns of trophic flow are being affected. In the Humboldt Current ecosystem, arguably one of the most productive marine systems, El Niño-Southern Oscillation is the main source of interannual and longer-term variability. To assess the effect of this variability on trophic flow we built a 16-year series of mass-specific somatic production rate (P/B) of the Peruvian scallop (Argopecten purpuratus), a species belonging to a former tropical fauna that thrived in this cold ecosystem. A strong increase of the P/B ratio of this species was observed during nutrient-poor, warmer water conditions typical of El Niño, owing to the massive recruitment of fast-growing juvenile scallops. Trophic ecology theory predicts that when primary production is nutrient limited, the trophic flow of organisms occupying low trophic levels should be constrained (bottom-up control). For former tropical fauna thriving in cold, productive upwelling coastal zones, a short time of low food conditions but warm waters during El Niño could be sufficient to waken their ancestral biological features and display massive proliferations. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Submergence tolerance and elongation ability of the tested genotypes were measured in screening tanks along with tolerant and susceptible checks. The genotypes FR13A, Khoda, CR Dhan 300, Savitri Sub1, IR64 Sub1, IC-568009 and IC-568842 exhibited high submergence tolerance may be used as donor in the breeding program. Landrace 'Khoda' showed tolerance to submergence with moderate elongation ability for adaption. Boitalpakhia, Gayatri, Atiranga, Aghonibora, Chakaakhi, Moti, IC-567993 and IC-568921 possessed both characters of moderate elongation ability and moderate tolerance to submergence. Both of these traits are required for lowland varieties of eastern India to survive under flash flood and accumulated stagnant water conditions. RM8300, Sub1A203, AEX, Sub1BC2 and Sub1C173 were employed for molecular screening to identify the submergence-tolerant genotypes. Sub1A203 was capable of differentiating the tolerant and susceptible genotypes into groups. RM8300 and Sub1BC2 could also differentiate the genotypes with inclusion of some susceptible genotypes. The AEX and Sub1C173 marker could not show discrimination among the genotypes with respect to the traits. Using Sub1A203+Sub1BC2 was better amongst the combinations studied. The results of the study indicated a trend toward a negative association of Sub1BC2 with submergence tolerance while AEX and Sub1C marker did not show any significant association. The donors identified can be useful as parental lines while the molecular markers can be used for marker-assisted breeding work. © 2015 Académie des sciences.},

	abstract = {Epigenetics increasingly occupies a pivotal position in our understanding of inheritance, natural selection and, perhaps, even evolution. A survey of the PubMed database, however, reveals that the great majority (>93%) of epigenetic papers have an intra-, rather than an inter-generational focus, primarily on mechanisms and disease. Approximately ~1% of epigenetic papers even mention the nexus of epigenetics, natural selection and evolution. Yet, when environments are dynamic (e.g., climate change effects), there may be an “epigenetic advantage” to phenotypic switching by epigenetic inheritance, rather than by gene mutation. An epigenetically-inherited trait can arise simultaneously in many individuals, as opposed to a single individual with a gene mutation. Moreover, a transient epigenetically-modified phenotype can be quickly “sunsetted”, with individuals reverting to the original phenotype. Thus, epigenetic phenotype switching is dynamic and temporary and can help bridge periods of environmental stress. Epigenetic inheritance likely contributes to evolution both directly and indirectly. While there is as yet incomplete evidence of direct permanent incorporation of a complex epigenetic phenotype into the genome, doubtlessly, the presence of epigenetic markers and the phenotypes they create (which may sort quite separately from the genotype within a population) will influence natural selection and, so, drive the collective genotype of a population. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

For instance, adaptation may be constrained by pleiotropic or epistatic effects, both of which can be reflected in the structure of molecular interaction networks. To date, empirical studies investigating the role of molecular interactions in phenotypic evolution have been idiosyncratic, offering no clear patterns. Here, we investigated the network topology of genes putatively involved in local adaptation to two abiotic stressors—drought and cold—in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our findings suggest that the gene-interaction topologies for both cold and drought stress response are non-random, with genes that show genetic variation in drought expression response (eGxE) being significantly more peripheral and cold response genes being significantly more central than genes which do not show GxE. We suggest that the observed topologies reflect different constraints on the genetic pathways involved in environmental response. The approach presented here may inform predictive models linking genetic variation in molecular signalling networks with phenotypic variation, specifically traits involved in environmental response. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

I then show how this spatial ecological framework can be coupled with an adaptive dynamics approach to compute the invasion fitness of a rare mutant in a resident population at equilibrium. Under the additional assumption that mutations have small phenotypic effects, I show that the selection gradient can be expressed as a function of neutral measures of genetic and demographic structure. I discuss the connections between this approach and inclusive fitness theory, as well as the applicability and limits of this technique.

This limits our ability to predict the consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem function, particularly in real-world marine ecosystems that are species rich, and where multiple ecosystem functions are represented by multiple indicators. We investigated spatial variation in BEF relationships across a 300 000 m2 intertidal sandflat by nesting experimental manipulations of sediment pore water nitrogen concentration into sites with contrasting macro-benthic community composition. Our results highlight the significance of many different elements of biodiversity associated with environmental characteristics, community structure, functional diversity, ecological traits or particular species (ecosystem engineers) to important functions of coastal marine sediments (benthic oxygen consumption, ammonium pore water concentrations and flux across the sediment–water interface). Using the BEF relationships developed from our experiment, we demonstrate patchiness across a landscape in functional performance and the potential for changes in the location of functional hot and cold spots with increasing nutrient loading that have important implications for mapping and predicating change in functionality and the concomitant delivery of ecosystem services. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Leaf functional traits are important because they reflect physiological functions, such as transpiration and carbon assimilation. In particular, morphological leaf traits have the potential to summarize plants strategies in terms of water use efficiency, growth pattern and nutrient use. The leaf economics spectrum (LES) is a recognized framework in functional plant ecology and reflects a gradient of increasing specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen, phosphorus and cation content, and decreasing leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and carbon nitrogen ratio (CN). The LES describes different strategies ranging from that of short-lived leaves with high photosynthetic capacity per leaf mass to long-lived leaves with low mass-based carbon assimilation rates. However, traits that are not included in the LES might provide additional information on the species' physiology, such as those related to stomatal control. Protocols are presented for a wide range of leaf functional traits, including traits of the LES, but also traits that are independent of the LES. In particular, a new method is introduced that relates the plants’ regulatory behavior in stomatal conductance to vapor pressure deficit. The resulting parameters of stomatal regulation can then be compared to the LES and other plant functional traits. The results show that functional leaf traits of the LES were also valid predictors for the parameters of stomatal regulation. For example, leaf carbon concentration was positively related to the vapor pressure deficit (vpd) at the point of inflection and the maximum of the conductance-vpd curve. However, traits that are not included in the LES added information in explaining parameters of stomatal control: the vpd at the point of inflection of the conductance-vpd curve was lower for species with higher stomatal density and higher stomatal index. Overall, stomata and vein traits were more powerful predictors for explaining stomatal regulation than traits used in the LES. © 2015 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

	abstract = {Body size is a synthetic functional trait determining many key ecosystem properties. Reduction in average body size has been suggested as one of the universal responses to global warming in aquatic ecosystems. Climate change, however, coincides with human-enhanced dispersal of alien species and can facilitate their establishment. We address effects of species introductions on the size structure of recipient communities using data on Red Sea bivalves entering the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal. We show that the invasion leads to increase in median body size of the Mediterranean assemblage. Alien species are significantly larger than native Mediterranean bivalves, even though they represent a random subset of the Red Sea species with respect to body size. The observed patterns result primarily from the differences in the taxonomic composition and body-size distributions of the source and recipient species pools. In contrast to the expectations based on the general temperature-size relationships in marine ectotherms, continued warming of the Mediterranean Sea indirectly leads to an increase in the proportion of large-bodied species in bivalve assemblages by accelerating the entry and spread of tropical aliens. These results underscore complex interactions between changing climate and species invasions in driving functional shifts in marine ecosystems. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Soybean [Glycine max [L.] Merr.] is the most important legume cropped worldwide, with important roles in human and animal nutrition, besides broad industrial applications. The United States and South American countries account for most of the world grain production, but cropped areas in "low-income food-deficit countries" are increasing, highlighting an important role for soybean as a protein source for impoverished populations. The legume has been rated as the highest contribution of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) among the grain producers, with reports of rates of up to 450kgNha-1. South American countries represent an excellent example of success of BNF with soybean, reaching high yields with no N-fertilizer; furthermore, yield increases associated with annual reinoculation are consistent. Low contributions of BNF are usually associated with countries with breeding and cropping managements with high inputs of N-fertilizers. Interestingly, only a few Bradyrhizobium strains have been used in inoculants worldwide. These strains have a high capacity of BNF, but there are possibilities of searching for or developing new effective strains, also including important traits such as higher competitiveness and tolerance to pesticides. Besides the economic importance, saving billions of dollars with the replacement of N-fertilizers, the environmental impacts of BNF by soybean should be emphasized, with lower emission of greenhouse gases and pollution of water reservoirs. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Evidence linking pythons to mammal declines has been indirect and there are reasons to question whether pythons, or any predator, could have caused the precipitous declines seen across a range of mammalian functional groups. Experimentally manipulating marsh rabbits, we found that pythons accounted for 77% of rabbit mortalities within 11 months of their translocation to ENP and that python predation appeared to preclude the persistence of rabbit populations in ENP. On control sites, outside of the park, no rabbits were killed by pythons and 71% of attributable marsh rabbit mortalities were classified as mammal predations. Burmese pythons pose a serious threat to the faunal communities and ecological functioning of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem, which will probably spread as python populations expand their range. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Global climate shifts and ecological flexibility are two major factors that may affect rates of speciation and extinction across clades. Here, we connect past climate to changes in diet and diversification dynamics of ruminant mammals. Using novel versions of Multi-State Speciation and Extinction models, we explore the most likely scenarios for evolutionary transitions among diets in this clade and ask whether ruminant lineages with different feeding styles (browsing, grazing and mixed feeding) underwent differential rates of diversification concomitant with global temperature change. The best model of trait change had transitions from browsers to grazers via mixed feeding, with appreciable rates of transition to and from grazing and mixed feeding. Diversification rates in mixed-feeder and grazer lineages tracked the palaeotemperature curve, exhibiting higher rates during the Miocene thermal maxima. The origination of facultative mixed diet and grazing states may have triggered two adaptive radiations-one during the Oligocene-Miocene transition and the other during Middle-to-Late Miocene. Our estimate of mixed diets for basal lineages of both bovids and cervids is congruent with fossil evidence, while the reconstruction of browser ancestors for some impoverished clades- Giraffidae and Tragulidae-is not. Our results offer model-based neontological support to previous palaeontological findings and fossil-based hypothesis highlighting the importance of dietary innovations-especially mixed feeding-in the success of ruminants during the Neogene. © 2013 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Based on avian and mammalian fossils found in the northeastern Chinese province of Liaoning and physiological traits linked to homeothermy, a hypothesis of evolution of homeothermic animals is proposed. It is based on the importance of muscle function in cold environment, as a strong selection pressure that favors endothermic metabolism during periods of cold climates. The presented hypothesis postulates that in progressively cooling environment, animals will develop thermal insulation, increased basal metabolism if food is available, and torpor when food is scarce. Since late Permian, Triassic and Cretaceous global temperatures were high, an exceptional place that gradually became cold was needed for the homeothermy evolution.South China Craton is here proposed as a plausible candidate for that role since it drifted across the Paleo-Tethys ocean, from equator to high northern latitudes in a journey that lasted from 250 to 200. Myr ago. After this small continent collided with North China Craton some 200. Myr ago, the already cold-adapted animals had spread to large, mostly empty spaces on the North China Craton, due to their evolutionary advantage of making active living in the cold environment. The most advantageous early homeothermic animals went further north to the cold Liaoning to start an oasis that delivered modern birds during next 50. Myr. Modern mammals possibly evolved somewhere in the cold vicinity. This made Liaoning and similarly cold places the cradles of early birds and early mammals since for the following millions of years these places remained too cold for poikilotherms to enter and warm enough for homeotherms to dwell, until the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event and subsequent global cooling that diminished poikilotherms. Homeothermy was probably even more important as a survival advantage in cooler climates of Paleogene, when mammals and birds became dominant animals.This interpretation is probably supported by a recent report that a small primate Archicebus achilles dated ~55. Myr ago was found in the more south central China Hubei Province, while Hadrocodium wui, extinct mammaliaform that lived 195. Myr ago in what is now the Yunnan province in southwestern China. The final confirmation of the proposed scenario would be to find somewhere in South China avian fossils older than those found in Liaoning, or to find the cradle of early mammals somewhere in Northern China. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Rise in global sea surface temperature (SST), which is approximately 1°C higher now than 140 years ago and is one of the primary physical impacts of global warming, has been linked to such increases. In this chapter, major known effects of increasing SST on the biology and ecology of vibrios are described. They include the effects on bacterial growth rate, both in the field and in laboratory, culturability, expression of pathogenicity traits, and interactions with aquatic organisms and abiotic surfaces. Special emphasis is given to the effect of ocean warming on Vibrio interactions with zooplankters, which represent one of the most important aquatic reservoirs for these bacteria. The reported findings highlight the biocomplexity of the interactions between vibrios and their natural environment in a climate change scenario, posing the need for interdisciplinary studies to properly understand the connection between ocean warming and persistence and spread of vibrios in sea waters and the epidemiology of the diseases they cause. © 2014 American Society for Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is a widespread phenomenon, allowing organisms to better adapt to changing environments. Most empirical and theoretical studies are restricted to irreversible plasticity where the expression of a specific phenotype is mostly determined during development. However, reversible plasticity is not uncommon; here, organisms are able to switch back and forth between phenotypes. We present two optimization models for the fitness of (i) non-plastic, (ii) irreversibly plastic, and (iii) reversibly plastic genotypes in a fluctuating environment. In one model, the fitness values of an organism during different life phases act together multiplicatively (so as to consider traits that are related to survival). The other model additionally considers additive effects (corresponding to traits related to fecundity). Both models yield qualitatively similar results. If the only costs of reversible plasticity are due to temporal maladaptation while switching between phenotypes, reversibility is virtually always advantageous over irreversibility, especially for slow environmental fluctuations. If reversibility implies an overall decreased fitness, then irreversibility is advantageous if the environment fluctuates quickly or if stress events last relatively short. Our results are supported by observations from different types of organisms and have implications for many basic and applied research questions, e.g., on invasive alien species. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Recent global change has had a substantial influence on the distribution of organisms, and many species are currently expanding their ranges. To evaluate the underlying processes, long-term data with good geographic resolution are essential. One important but generally overlooked data source is offered by the taxon-specific national catalogues of first provincial records that are kept in many countries. Here, we use such data to quantify traitbased influences on range expansion in Swedish butterflies and moths between 1973 and 2010. Of 282 species meeting pre-defined quality criteria, 170 expanded their northern range margin, with a mean expansion rate of 2.7 km per year. The analyses demonstrate that habitat and diet generalists, forest species and species active during warm conditions have expanded their ranges more rapidly than other species. Notably, range expansion in diet specialists was positively related to a nitrogen-favoured larval diet, an effect not found among oligo- or polyphagous species. In contrast to the general view, this shows that specialist species can undergo rapid range expansion. We suggest that increased areas of nitrogen-rich habitat, and increased availability of a nitrogen-favoured diet, are among the most important drivers of range expansions, potentially having far-reaching consequences for a wide variety of organisms. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Species with broader geographical ranges are expected to be ecological generalists, while species with higher heat tolerances may be relatively competitive at more extreme and increasing temperatures. Thus, both traits are expected to relate to increased survival during transport to new regions of the globe, and once there, establishment and spread. Here, we explore these expectations using datasets of latitudinal range breadth and heat tolerance in freshwater and marine invertebrates and fishes. After accounting for the latitude and hemisphere of each species' native range, we find that species introduced to freshwater systems have broader geographical ranges in comparison to native species. Moreover, introduced species are more heat tolerant than related native species collected from the same habitats. We further test for differences in range breadth and heat tolerance in relation to invasion success by comparing species that have established geographically restricted versus extensive introduced distributions. We find that geographical range size is positively related to invasion success in freshwater species only. However, heat tolerance is implicated as a trait correlated to widespread occurrence of introduced populations in both freshwater and marine systems. Our results emphasize the importance of formal risk assessments before moving heat tolerant species to novel locations. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Androgenesis is the production of an offspring containing exclusively the nuclear genome of the fathering male via the maternal eggs. This unusual mating system is generally considered a male trait, giving to androgenetic males a substantial fitness advantage over their sexually reproducing relatives. We here provide the first empirical studyof the evolutionaryoutcomes of androgenesis in a haplo-diploid organism: the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata. Some of the populations of this species have a classical haplo-diploid sexual mating system. In other populations, females and males are produced through parthenogenesis and androgenesis, respectively, whereas workers are produced sexually. We conducted laboratory reciprocal-cross experiments with reproductive individuals from both types of populations and analysed their progenies with genetic markers, to determine the respective contribution of males and females to the production of androgenetic males. We found that androgenesis was a parthenogenetic female trait. A population genetic study conducted in natura confirmed the parthenogenetic female origin of androgenesis, with the identification of introgression events of sexualmale genotypes into androgenetic/parthenogenetic lineages.We argue that by producingmales via androgenesis, parthenogenetic queen lineages may increase and/or maintain their adaptive potential, while maintaining the integrity of their own genome, by occasionally acquiring new male genetic material and avoiding inbreeding depression within the sexually produced worker cast. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

According to animal welfare guidelines, non-invasive techniques should be preferred whenever applicable. In our group, we work on different species of song birds in the lab and in the field, and we successfully apply non-invasive methods to sex and individually mark chicks. This paper presents a comprehensive non-invasive tool-box. Sexing birds prior to the expression of secondary sexual traits requires the collection of DNA-bearing material for PCR We established a quick and easy method to sex birds of any age (post hatching) by extracting DNA from buccal swabs. Results can be obtained within 3 hours. For individual marking chick's down feathers are trimmed in specific patterns allowing fast identification within the hatching order. This set of methods is easily applicable in a standard equipped lab and especially suitable for working in the field as no special equipment is required for sampling and storage. Handling of chicks is minimized and marking and sexing techniques are non-invasive thereby supporting the RRR-principle of animal welfare guidelines. © JoVE 2006-2014. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {Pongamia pinnata has an added advantage of N2-fixing ability and tolerance to stress conditions as compared with other biodiesel crops. It harbours "rhizobia" as an endophytic bacterial community on its root nodules. A gram-negative, nonmotile, fast-growing, rod-shaped, bacterial strain VKLR-01T was isolated from root nodules of Pongamia that grew optimal at 28°C, pH 7.0 in presence of 2% NaCl. Isolate VKLR-01 exhibits higher tolerance to the prevailing adverse conditions, for example, salt stress, elevated temperatures and alkalinity. Strain VKLR-01T has the major cellular fatty acid as C18:1 ω7c (65.92%). Strain VKLR-01 T was found to be a nitrogen fixer using the acetylene reduction assay and PCR detection of a nifH gene. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic distinctiveness and molecular data (16S rRNA, recA, and atpD gene sequences, G + C content, DNA-DNA hybridization etc.), strain VKLR-01T = (MTCC 10513T = MSCL 1015T) is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Rhizobium for which the name Rhizobium pongamiae sp. nov. is proposed. Rhizobium pongamiae may possess specific traits that can be transferred to other rhizobia through biotechnological tools and can be directly used as inoculants for reclamation of wasteland; hence, they are very important from both economic and environmental prospects. © 2013 Vigya Kesari et al.},

To explore the possible effects of NO on cell motility, human lung cancer cells were exposed to nontoxic concentrations of NO for 0-14 days, and the migratory characteristics of the cells were determined. The present study found that long-term treatment with NO significantly enhanced cell migration in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that the increased migratory action was associated with the increased expression of caveolin-1 (Cav-1), which in turn activated the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and ATP-dependent tyrosine kinase (Akt) pathways. Notably, the NO-treated cells exhibited an increased number of filopodia per cell, as well as an increase in the levels of cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) protein. Together, these results indicate that extended NO exposure has a novel effect on cell migration through a Cav-1-dependent mechanism, a finding that strengthens our understanding of cancer biology. © 2013 Arpasinee Sanuphan et al.},

	abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental life-history trait for many ecological processes. Recent studies suggest that dispersers, in comparison to residents, display various phenotypic specializations increasing their dispersal inclination or success. Among them, dispersers are believed to be consistentlymore bold, exploratory, asocial or aggressive than residents. These links between behavioural types and dispersal should vary with the cause of dispersal. However, with the exception of one study, personality-dependent dispersal has not been studied in contrasting environments. Here, we used mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) to test whether personality-dependent dispersal varies with predation risk, a factor that should induce boldness or sociability-dependent dispersal. Corroborating previous studies, we found that dispersing mosquitofish are less social than non-dispersing fish when there was no predation risk. However, personality-dependent dispersal is negated under predation risk, dispersers having similar personality types to residents. Our results suggest that adaptive dispersal decisions could commonly depend on interactions between phenotypes and ecological contexts. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

	abstract = {The ecological impacts of predation risk are influenced by how prey allocate foraging effort across periods of safety and danger. Foraging decisions depend on current danger, but also on the larger temporal, spatial or energetic context in which prey manage their risks of predation and starvation. Using a rocky intertidal food chain, we examined the responses of starved and fed prey (Nucella lapillus dogwhelks) to different temporal patterns of risk from predatory crabs (Carcinus maenas). Prey foraging activity declined during periods of danger, but as dangerous periods became longer, prey state altered the magnitude of risk effects on prey foraging and growth, with likely consequences for community structure (trait-mediated indirect effects on basal resources,Mytilus edulis mussels), prey fitness and trophic energy transfer. Because risk is inherently variable over time and space, our results suggest that non-consumptive predator effects may be most pronounced in productive systems where prey can build energy reserves during periods of safety and then burn these reserves as ‘trophic heat’ during extended periods of danger. Understanding the interaction between behavioural (energy gain) and physiological (energy use) responses to risk may illuminate the context dependency of trait-mediated trophic cascades and help explain variation in food chain length. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Around the world, the human-induced collapses of populations and species have triggered a sixth mass extinction crisis, with rare species often being the first to disappear. Although the role of species diversity in the maintenance of ecosystem processes has been widely investigated, the role of rare species remains controversial. A critical issue is whether common species insure against the loss of functions supported by rare species. This issue is even more critical in species-rich ecosystems where high functional redundancy among species is likely and where it is thus often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered against species loss. Here, using extensive datasets of species occurrences and functional traits from three highly diverse ecosystems (846 coral reef fishes, 2,979 alpine plants, and 662 tropical trees), we demonstrate that the most distinct combinations of traits are supported predominantly by rare species both in terms of local abundance and regional occupancy. Moreover, species that have low functional redundancy and are likely to support the most vulnerable functions, with no other species carrying similar combinations of traits, are rarer than expected by chance in all three ecosystems. For instance, 63% and 98% of fish species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions in coral reef ecosystems are locally and regionally rare, respectively. For alpine plants, 32% and 89% of such species are locally and regionally rare, respectively. Remarkably, 47% of fish species and 55% of tropical tree species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions have only one individual per sample on average. Our results emphasize the importance of rare species conservation, even in highly diverse ecosystems, which are thought to exhibit high functional redundancy. Rare species offer more than aesthetic, cultural, or taxonomic diversity value; they disproportionately increase the potential breadth of functions provided by ecosystems across spatial scales. As such, they are likely to insure against future uncertainty arising from climate change and the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems. Our results call for a more detailed understanding of the role of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem functioning. © 2013 Mouillot et al.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary potential of populations is mainly determined by population size and available genetic variance. However, the adaptability of spatially structured populations may also be affected by dispersal: positively by spreading beneficial mutations across sub-populations, but negatively by moving locally adapted alleles between demes. We develop an individual-based, two-patch, allelic model to investigate the balance between these opposing effects on a population's evolutionary response to rapid climate change. Individual fitness is controlled by two polygenic traits coding for local adaptation either to the environment or to climate. Under conditions of selection that favour the evolution of a generalist phenotype (i.e. weak divergent selection between patches) dispersal has an overall positive effect on the persistence of the population. However, when selection favours locally adapted specialists, the beneficial effects of dispersal outweigh the associated increase in maladaptation for a narrowrange of parameter space only (intermediate selection strength and low linkage among loci), where the spread of beneficial climate alleles is not strongly hampered by selection against non-specialists. Given that local selection across heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes is common, the complex effect of dispersal thatwe describe will play an important role in determining the evolutionary dynamics of many species under rapidly changing climate. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Rising CO2 levels in the oceans are predicted to have serious consequences for many marine taxa. Recent studies suggest that non-genetic parental effects may reduce the impact of high CO2 on the growth, survival and routine metabolic rate of marine fishes, but whether the parental environment mitigates behavioural and sensory impairment associated with high CO2 remains unknown. Here, we tested the acute effects of elevated CO2 on the escape responses of juvenile fish and whether such effects were altered by exposure of parents to increased CO2 (transgenerational acclimation). Elevated CO2 negatively affected the reactivity and locomotor performance of juvenile fish, but parental exposure to high CO2 reduced the effects in some traits, indicating the potential for acclimation of behavioural impairment across generations. However, acclimation was not complete in some traits, and absent in others, suggesting that transgenerational acclimation does not completely compensate the effects of high CO2 on escape responses. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Species are shifting their ranges under climate change, with genetic and evolutionary consequences. As a result, the spatial distribution of genetic diversity in a species' range can show a signature of range expansion. This genetic signature takes time to decay after the range stops expanding and it is important to take that lag time into account when interpreting contemporary spatial patterns of genetic diversity. In addition, the return to spatial equilibrium on an ecologically relevant timescale will depend on migration of genetic diversity across the species' range. However, during a range shift alleles may go extinct at the retracting range margin due to spatial sorting. Here we studied the spatial pattern of genotypes that differ in dispersal rate across the species range before, during and after a range shift, assessed the effect of range retraction on this pattern, and quantified the duration of the ephemeral genetic signature of range expansion for this trait. We performed simulation experiments with an individual-based metapopulation model under several contemporary climate change scenarios. The results show an increase of the number of individuals with high dispersal rate. If the temperature increased long enough the allele coding for low dispersal rate would go extinct. The duration of the genetic signature of range expansion after stabilisation of the species' distribution lasted up to 1200 generations after a temperature increase for 60 years at the contemporary rate. This depended on the total displacement of the climate optimum, as the product of the rate of temperature increase and its duration. So genetic data collected in the field do not necessarily reflect current selection pressures but can be affected by historic changes in species distribution, long after the establishment of the current species' range. Return to equilibrium patterns may be hampered by loss of evolutionary potential during range shift. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Mixed-species assemblages are often unintentionally introduced into new ecosystems. Analysing how assemblage structure varies during transport may provide insights into how introduction risk changes before propagules are released. Characterization of introduction risk is typically based on assessments of colonization pressure (CP, the number of species transported) and total propagule pressure (total PP, the total abundance of propagules released) associated with an invasion vector. Generally, invasion potential following introduction increases with greater CP or total PP. Here, we extend these assessments using rank-abundance distributions to examine how CP: total PP relationships change temporally in ballast water of ocean-going ships. Rank-abundance distributions and CP: total PP patterns varied widely between trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific voyages, with the latter appearing to pose a much lower risk than the former. Responses also differed by taxonomic group, with invertebrates experiencing losses mainly in total PP,while diatoms and dinoflagellates sustained losses mainly in CP. In certain cases, open-ocean ballastwater exchange appeared to increase introduction risk by uptake of new species or supplementation of existing ones. Our study demonstrates that rankabundance distributions provide new insights into the utility of CP and PP in characterizing introduction risk. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Upland rice is important for sustainable crop production to meet future food demands. The expansion in area of irrigated rice faces limitations due to water scarcity resulting from climate change. Therefore, this research aimed to identify potential genotypes and suitable traits of upland rice germplasm for breeding programmes. Forty-three genotypes were evaluated in a randomised complete block design with three replications. All genotypes exhibited a wide and significant variation for 22 traits. The highest phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variation was recorded for the number of filled grains/panicle and yields/plant (g). The highest heritability was found for photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO and number of filled grains/panicle and yields/plant (g). Cluster analysis based on 22 traits grouped the 43 rice genotypes into five clusters. Cluster II was the largest and consisted of 20 genotypes mostly originating from the Philippines. The first four principle components of 22 traits accounted for about 72% of the total variation and indicated a wide variation among the genotypes. The selected best trait of the number of filled grains/panicle and yields/plant (g), which showed high heritability and high genetic advance, could be used as a selection criterion for hybridisation programmes in the future. © 2015 Mst.

Inthis modelling study, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of thermaland plant–herbivore interaction traits in a warming environment. We findthe herbivore usually reduces adaptation speed and persistence time ofthe plant by reducing biomass. However, if the plant interaction trait andthermal trait are correlated, herbivores can create different coevolutionaryattractors. One attractor has a warmer plant thermal optimum, and theother a colder one compared with the environment. Awarmer plant thermalstrategy is given a head start under warming, the only case where herbivorescan increase plant persistence under warming. Persistence time of the plantunder warming is maximal at small or large thermal niche width. This studyshows that considering trophic interactions is necessary and feasible forunderstanding how ecosystems respond to climate change. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {An evolutionary response to selection requires genetic variation; however, even if it exists, then the genetic details of the variation can constrain adaptation. In the simplest case, unlinked loci and uncorrelated phenotypes respond directly to multivariate selection and permit unrestricted paths to adaptive peaks. By contrast, 'antagonistic' pleiotropic loci may constrain adaptation by affecting variation of many traits and limiting the direction of trait correlations to vectors that are not favoured by selection. However, certain pleiotropic configurations may improve the conditions for adaptive evolution. Here, we present evidence that the Arabidopsis thaliana gene FRI (FRIGIDA) exhibits 'adaptive' pleiotropy, producing trait correlations along an axis that results in two adaptive strategies. Derived, low expression FRI alleles confer a 'drought escape' strategy owing to fast growth, low water use efficiency and early flowering. By contrast, a dehydration avoidance strategy is conferred by the ancestral phenotype of late flowering, slow growth and efficient water use during photosynthesis. The dehydration avoidant phenotype was recovered when genotypes with null FRI alleles were transformed with functional alleles. Our findings indicate that the well-documented effects of FRI on phenology result from differences in physiology, not only a simple developmental switch. © 2013 The Authors.},

The chosen floral traits were under selection by hummingbird and hawkmoth pollinators, with hawkmoth abundance highly variable across years. Selection for flower length showed environmental sensitivity, with stronger selection in years with later snowmelt, as higher water resources can allow translation of pollination success into fitness based on seed production. Selection on corolla width also varied across years, favouring narrower corolla tubes in two unusual years with hawkmoths, and wider corollas in another late snowmelt year.

In Bolivia, both wild and domestic populations of Triatoma infestans exist. Their ecological niches are normally separated and the two populations do not interbreed, behaving as two distinct species. However, it has been suggested that the two populations may compete, highlighting therefore the potential risk of wild populations invading human dwellings. The model revealed the importance of the basic reproduction rates R0 of triatomine colonies for the risk of invasion. This depends not only on life traits such as survival and fecundity, but also on (1) the density-dependence phenomenon that limits triatomine establishment, (2) on house exposure to infection and (3) on the correlation between house susceptibility to domestic T. infestans and house susceptibility to wild T. infestans. Competition and coexistence amongst the two groups of T. infestans may occur under particular conditions, but are very unlikely. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Acade7acute;mie des sciences.},

In orientation experiments, hatchlings that developed in the normal ambient field oriented approximately south when exposed to a field that exists near the northern coast of Portugal, a direction consistent with their migratory route in the northeastern Atlantic. By contrast, hatchlings that developed in a distorted magnetic field had orientation indistinguishable from random when tested in the same north Portugal field. No differences existed between the two groups in orientation assays involving responses to orbital movements of waves or sea-finding, neither of which involves magnetic field perception. These findings, to our knowledge, demonstrate for the first time that the magnetic environment present during early development can influence the magnetic orientation behaviour of a neonatal migratory animal. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {An individual's environmental history may have delayed effects on its physiology and life history at later stages in life because of irreversible plastic responses of early ontogenesis to environmental conditions. We chose a marine fish, the common sole, as a model species to study these effects, because it inhabits shallow marine areas highly exposed to environmental changes. We tested whether temperature and trophic conditions experienced during the larval stage had delayed effects on life-history traits and resistance to hypoxia at the juvenile stage. We thus examined the combined effect of global warming and hypoxia in coastal waters, which are potential stressors to many estuarine and coastal marine fishes. Elevated temperature and better trophic conditions had a positive effect on larval growth and developmental rates; warmer larval temperature had a delayed positive effect on body mass and resistance to hypoxia at the juvenile stage. The latter suggests a lower oxygen demand of individuals that had experienced elevated temperatures during larval stages. We hypothesize that an irreversible plastic response to temperature occurred during early ontogeny that allowed adaptive regulation of metabolic rates and/or oxygen demand with long-lasting effects. These results could deeply affect predictions about impacts of global warming and eutrophication on marine organisms. © The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection is a powerful evolutionary mechanism that has shaped the physiology, behaviour and morphology of the sexes to the extent that it can reduce viability while promoting traits that enhance reproductive success. Predation is one of the underlying mechanisms accounting for viability costs of sexual displays. Therefore, we should expect that individuals of the two sexes adjust their anti-predator behaviour in response to changes in predation risk. We conducted a meta-analysis of 28 studies (42 species) of sex differences in risk-taking behaviour in lizards and tested whether these differences could be explained by sexual dichromatism, by sexual size dimorphism or by latitude. Latitude was the best predictor of the interspecific heterogeneity in sex-specific behaviour. Males did not change their escape behaviour with latitude, whereas females had increasingly reduced wariness at higher latitudes. We hypothesize that this sex difference in risk-taking behaviour is linked to sex-specific environmental constraints that more strongly affect the reproductive effort of females than males. This novel latitudinal effect on sex-specific anti-predator behaviour has important implications for responses to climate change and for the relative roles of natural and sexual selection in different species. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Plants, as sessile organisms, have developed, in the course of their evolution, efficient strategies of response to avoid, tolerate, or adapt to different types of stress situations. The diverse stress factors that plants have to face often activate similar cell signaling pathways and cellular responses, such as the production of stress proteins, upregulation of the antioxidant machinery, and accumulation of compatible solutes. Over the last few decades advances in plant physiology, genetics, and molecular biology have greatly improved our understanding of plant responses to abiotic stress conditions.

	abstract = {How does recent climatewarming and climate variability alter fitness, phenotypic selection and evolution in natural populations?We combine biophysical, demographic and evolutionary models with recent climate data to address this question for the subalpine and alpine butterfly, Colias meadii, in the southern Rocky Mountains. We focus on predicting patterns of selection and evolution for a key thermoregulatory trait, melanin (solar absorptivity) on the posterior ventral hindwings, which affects patterns of body temperature, flight activity, adult and egg survival, and reproductive success in Colias. Both mean annual summer temperatures and thermal variability within summers have increased during the past 60 years at subalpine and alpine sites. At the subalpine site, predicted directional selection on wing absorptivity has shifted from generally positive (favouring increased wing melanin) to generally negative during the past 60 years, but there is substantial variation among years in the predicted magnitude and direction of selection and the optimal absorptivity. The predicted magnitude of directional selection at the alpine site declined during the past 60 years and varies substantially among years, but selection has generally been positive at this site. Predicted evolutionary responses to mean climate warming at the subalpine site since 1980 is small, because of the variability in selection and asymmetry of the fitness function. At both sites, the predicted effects of adaptive evolution on mean population fitness are much smaller than the fluctuations in mean fitness due to climate variability among years. Our analyses suggest that variation in climate within and among years may strongly limit evolutionary responses of ectotherms to mean climate warming in these habitats. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

We however lack understanding of the changes in life histories that contributed to the increased population growth rate of agriculturalists, because comparable individual-based reproductive records of sympatric populations of agriculturalists and foragers are rarely found. Here, we compared key life-history traits and population growth rate using comprehensive data from the seventieth to nineteenth century Northern Finland: indigenous Samiwere nomadic hunter-fishers and reindeer herders, whereas sympatric agricultural Finns relied predominantly on animal husbandry. We found that agriculturebased families had higher lifetime fecundity, faster birth spacing and lower maternal mortality. Furthermore, agricultural Finns had 6.2% higher annual population growth rate than traditional Sami, which was accounted by differences between the subsistence modes in age-specific fecundity but not in mortality.

Variation in mutualism-related traits between native and invasive species however, can exacerbate the spread of invasive species (‘invasional meltdown’) if invasive partners strongly interact. Here we show how invasion by a seed-dispersing ant (Myrmica rubra) promotes recruitment of a co-introduced invasive over native ant-dispersed (myrmecochorous) plants. We created experimental communities of invasive (M. rubra) or native ants (Aphaenogaster rudis) and invasive and native plants and measured seed dispersal and plant recruitment. In our mesocosms, and in laboratory and field trials, M. rubra acted as a superior seed disperser relative to the native ant. By contrast, previous studies have found that invasive ants are often poor seed dispersers compared with native ants. Despite belonging to the same behavioural guild, seed-dispersing antswere not functionally redundant. Instead, native and invasive ants hadstronglydivergent effects onplant communities: the invasive plant dominated inthe presence of the invasive ant andthe native plants dominated in the presence of the native ant. Community changeswere not due to preferences for coevolved partners: variation in functional traits of linked partners drove differences.

Self-assembled antimicrobial peptides have evolved from the area of antimicrobial peptides. Peptides serve as important weapons in nature, and increasingly medicine, for combating microbial infection and biofilms. Self-assembled peptides harness a “bottom-up” approach, whereby the primary peptide sequence may be modified with natural and unnatural amino acids to produce an inherently antimicrobial hydrogel. Gelation may be tailored to occur in the presence of physiological and infective indicators (e.g. pH, enzymes) and therefore allow local, targeted antimicrobial therapy at the site of infection. Peptides demonstrate inherent biocompatibility, antimicrobial activity, biodegradability and numerous functional groups. They are therefore prime candidates for the production of polymeric molecules that have the potential to be conjugated to biomaterials with precision. Non-native chemistries and functional groups are easily incorporated into the peptide backbone allowing peptide hydrogels to be tailored to specific functional requirements. This article reviews an area of increasing interest, namely self-assembled peptides and their potential therapeutic applications as innovative hydrogels and biomaterials in the prevention of biofilm-related infection. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

I use a plant invasion as a model system to tackle this question by combining molecular markers, a common garden experiment and climatic niche modelling. This approach reveals that non-native Lactuca serriola originates primarily from Europe, a climatic subset of its native range, with low rates of admixture from Asia. It has rapidly refilled its climatic niche in the new range, associated with the evolution of flowering phenology to produce clines along climate gradients that mirror those across the native range. Consequently, some non-native plants have evolved development times and grow under climates more extreme than those found in Europe, but not among populations from the native range as a whole. This suggests that many plant populations can adapt rapidly to changed climatic conditions that are already within the climatic niche space occupied by the species elsewhere in its range, but that evolution to conditions outside of this range is more difficult. These findings can also help to explain the prevalence of niche conservatism among non-native species. © 2013 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Liquid radioactive waste is a common by-product when using radioactive isotopes in research and medicine. Efficient remediation of such liquid waste is crucial for increasing safety during the necessary storage of the material. Herein, we present a novel Gum Karaya stabilized magnetite for the efficient removal of radioactive phosphorus 32P from liquid radioactive waste. This environmentally friendly material is well suited to be used as a nanohydrogel for the removal of liquid waste, which can then be stored in a smaller space and without the risk of the spills inherent to the initial liquid material. The maximum adsorption capacity of the GK/M in this study was found to be 15.68 GBq/g. We present a thorough morphological characterization of the synthesised GK/M, as well as a discussion of the possible phosphorus adsorption mechanisms. © 2014 Vinod Vellora Thekkae Padil et al.},

	abstract = {The only symbiotic Mediterranean gorgonian, Eunicella singularis, has faced several mortality events connected to abnormal high temperatures. Since thermotolerance data remain scarce, heat-induced necrosis was monitored in aquarium by morphometric analysis. Gorgonian tips were sampled at two sites: Medes (Spain) and Riou (France) Islands, and at two depths: -15 m and-35 m. Although coming from contrasting thermal regimes, seawater above 28 C led to rapid and complete tissue necrosis for all four populations. However, at 27 C, the time length leading to 50% tissue necrosis allowed us to classify samples within three classes of thermal sensitivity. Irrespectively of the depth, Medes specimens were either very sensitive or resistant, while Riou fragments presented a medium sensitivity. Microsatellite analysis revealed that host and symbiont were genetically differentiated between sites, but not between depths. Finally, these genetic differentiations were not directly correlated to a specific thermal sensitivity whose molecular bases remain to be discovered. © 2013 Académie des sciences.},

	abstract = {A central question in community ecology is the means by which species coexist. Models of coexistence often assume that species have fixed trait values and consider questions such as how tradeoffs and environmental variation influence coexistence and diversity. However, species traits can be dynamic, varying between populations and individuals and changing over time as species adapt and evolve, at rates that are relevant to ecological processes. Consequently, adding evolution to ecological coexistence models may modify their predictions and stability in complex or unexpected ways. We extend a well-studied coexistence mechanism depending on resource fluctuations by allowing evolution along a tradeoff between maximum growth rate and competitive ability. Interactions between favorable season length and the period of fluctuations constrain coexistence, with two species coexistence favored by intermediate season length and arising through evolutionary branching or non-local invasion. However, these results depend on the relative rates of ecological and evolutionary processes: rapid evolution leads to a complete breakdown of otherwise stable coexistence. Other coexistence mechanisms should be evaluated from an evolutionary perspective to examine how evolutionary forces may alter predicted ecological dynamics. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Synthetic glycopolymers are instrumental and versatile tools used in various biochemical and biomedical research fields. An example of a facile and efficient synthesis of well-controlled fluorescent statistical glycopolymers using reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT)- based polymerization is demonstrated. The synthesis starts with the preparation of β-galactose-containing glycomonomer 2-lactobionamidoethyl methacrylamide obtained by reaction of lactobionolactone and N-(2-aminoethyl) methacrylamide (AEMA). 2-Gluconamidoethyl methacrylamide (GAEMA) is used as a structural analog lacking a terminal β-galactoside. The following RAFT-mediated copolymerization reaction involves three different monomers: N-(2-hydroxyethyl) acrylamide as spacer, AEMA as target for further fluorescence labeling, and the glycomonomers. Tolerant of aqueous systems, the RAFT agent used in the reaction is (4-cyanopentanoic acid)-4-dithiobenzoate. Low dispersities (≤1.32), predictable copolymer compositions, and high reproducibility of the polymerizations were observed among the products. Fluorescent polymers are obtained by modifying the glycopolymers with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester targeting the primary amine functional groups on AEMA. Lectin-binding specificities of the resulting glycopolymers are verified by testing with corresponding agarose beads coated with specific glycoepitope recognizing lectins. Because of the ease of the synthesis, the tight control of the product compositions and the good reproducibility of the reaction, this protocol can be translated towards preparation of other RAFT-based glycopolymers with specific structures and compositions, as desired. © 2015 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License.},

	abstract = {Aggregation of individuals is a common phenomenon in nature. By aggregating, individuals can reap benefits but may also be subject to associated costs from increased competition. The benefits of aggregation can depend on population density, which in turn can be affected by aggregation when it determines reproductive success of individuals. The Allee effect is often considered to be one of the factors that can explain the evolution of aggregation behavior. We investigated this hypothesis with a mathematical model which integrates population dynamics and evolution. Individuals gain synergistically from aggregation but suffer from scramble competition with aggregation tendency as an evolving trait. We found that aggregation behavior can stabilize the population dynamics and reduce population growth. The results show that the Allee effect alone is not sufficient for aggregative behavior to evolve as an evolutionarily stable strategy. We also found that weak local competition does not promote aggregation due to feedback from the population level: under low competition, the population can achieve high density such that aggregation becomes costly rather than beneficial. Our model instead exhibits an escalation of aggregation tendency, leading to the extinction of the population in a process known as evolutionary suicide. We conclude that for aggregation to evolve as an evolutionarily stable strategy we need to consider other factors such as inter-patch dispersal to new patches and avoidance of excessively large groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Remarkably, for diverse animal species, including humans, spontaneous patterns of waiting times show random 'burstiness' that appears scale-invariant across a broad set of scales. However, a general theory linking this phenomenon across the animal kingdom currently lacks an ecological basis. Here, we demonstrate from tracking the activities of 15 sympatric predator species (cephalopods, sharks, skates and teleosts) under natural and controlled conditions that bursty waiting times are an intrinsic spontaneous behaviour well approximated by heavy-tailed (power-law) models over data ranges up to four orders of magnitude. Scaling exponents quantifying ratios of frequent short to rare very long waits are species-specific, being determined by traits such as foraging mode (active versus ambush predation), body size and prey preference. A stochastic-deterministic decision model reproduced the empirical waiting time scaling and species-specific exponents, indicating that apparently complex scaling can emerge from simple decisions. Results indicate temporal power-law scaling is a behavioural 'rule of thumb' that is tuned to species' ecological traits, implying a common pattern may have naturally evolved that optimizes move wait decisions in less predictable natural environments. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {At the edge of a biological invasion, evolutionary processes (spatial sorting, natural selection) often drive increases in dispersal. Although numerous traits influence an individual’s displacement (e.g. speed, stamina), one of the most important is path straightness. A straight (i.e. highly correlated) path strongly enhances overall dispersal rate relative to time and energetic cost. Thus, we predict that, if path straightness has a genetic basis, organisms in the invasion vanguard will exhibit straighter paths than those following behind. Our studies on invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) in tropical Australia clearly support this prediction. Radio-tracking of field-collected toads at a single site showed that path straightness steadily decreased over the first 10 years post-invasion. Consistent with an evolved (genetic) basis to that behavioural shift, path straightness of toads reared under common garden conditions varied according to the location of their parents’ origin. Offspring produced by toads from the invasion vanguard followed straighter paths than did those produced by parents from long-established populations.At the individual level, offspring exhibited similar path straightness to their parents. The dramatic acceleration of the cane toad invasion through tropical Australia has been driven, in part, by the evolution of a behavioural tendency towards dispersing in a straight line. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is expected to double by the end of the century. Experiments have shown that this will have important effects on the physiology and ecology of photosynthetic organisms, but it is still unclear if elevated CO2 will elicit an evolutionary response in primary producers that causes changes in physiological and ecological attributes. In this study, we cultured lines of seven species of freshwater phytoplankton from three major groups at current (approx. 380 ppm CO2) and predicted future conditions (1000 ppm CO2) for over 750 generations. We grew the phytoplankton under three culture regimes: nutrient-replete liquid medium, nutrient-poor liquid medium and solid agar medium. We then performed reciprocal transplant assays to test for specific adaptation to elevated CO2 in these lines. We found no evidence for evolutionary change. We conclude that the physiology of carbon utilization may be conserved in natural freshwater phytoplankton communities experiencing rising atmospheric CO2 levels, without substantial evolutionary change. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Habitat loss often reduces the number of species as well as functional diver- sity. Dramatic effects to species composition have also been shown, but changes to functional composition have so far been poorly documented, partly owing to a lack of appropriate indices. We here develop three new community indices (i.e. functional integrity, community integrity of ecological groups and community specialization) to investigate how habitat loss affects the diversity and composition of functional traits and species. We used data from more than 5000 individuals of 137 bird species captured in 57 sites in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, a highly endangered biodiversity hot- spot. Results indicate that habitat loss leads to a decrease in functional integrity while measures of functional diversity remain unchanged or are even positively affected. Changes to functional integrity were caused by a decrease in the provisioning of some functions, and an increase in others; (ii) strong within-guild species turnover; and (iii) a replacement of specialists by generalists. Hence, communities from more deforested sites seem to provide different but not fewer functions. We show the importance of investigating changes to both diversity and composition of functional traits and species, as the effects of habitat loss on ecosystem functioning may be more complex than previously thought. Crucially, when only functional diversity is assessed, important changes to ecological functions may remain undetected and negative effects of habitat loss underestimated, thereby imperiling the application of effective conservation actions. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society},

	abstract = {Background: The morphology of red blood cells (RBCs) is altered significantly during the maturation stages of malaria parasites, which include ring, trophozoite, and schizont. There is dissimilarity in terms of the morphological characteristics of parasitized RBCs infected by the 4 species of Plasmodium, including falciparum, vivax, malariae, and ovale. This makes the process of diagnosis very difficult, which may lead to a wrong treatment method and substantial damage to the health of the patient. An innovative technique in introduced that accurately defines the shape of parasitized RBCs at each stage of infection as a potential method of diagnosis. Methods: Giemsa-stained thin blood films were prepared using blood samples collected from healthy donors as well as patients infected with P. malariae and P. ovale. The diameter and thickness of healthy and infected RBCs at each stage of infection were measured from their optical images using Olysia and Scanning Probe Image Processor (SPIP) software, respectively. A shape equation was fitted based on the morphological characteristics of RBCs, and their relative 2-dimensional shapes were plotted using Wolfram Mathematica. Results: At the ring stage, the thicknesses of RBCs parasitized by P. malariae (Pm-RBCs) and P. ovale (Po-RBCs) increased by 42% and 51%, respectively. Both Pm-RBCs and Po-RBCs remained nearly biconcave throughout parasite development even though their volumes increased. Conclusions: It is proposed that the morphology-based characterization technique introduced here could be used to intensify the accuracy of the Giemsa staining diagnosis method for the detection of the Plasmodium genus and infection stage. Based on the significant morphological alterations induced by different Plasmodium species, the results may also find practical use for faster prediction and treatment of human malaria. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.},

	abstract = {Temperature regime is known to have considerable influence on the life-histories of fish. Topmouth gudgeon is a very successful invader with high biological flexibility and phenotypic plasticity. The flexibility of topmouth gudgeon in a normal thermal regime has been well described, however there has been no information published about how it would cope with extreme conditions, e.g. permanently heated water. Several studies have demonstrated that phenotypic plasticity provides an important advantage to invasive species. To explain their invasion success, the theory of alternative ontogenies and invasive potential has been proposed. The aim of the present study was to examine if the reproductive parameters of a population living in permanently heated water differ from those living in habitats with a normal temperature regime, as well as to test a hypothesis derived from the theory of alternative ontogenies and invasive potential. Over a period of 8 years (2004-2011), a high variation in the reproductive parameters of topmouth gudgeon from Lake Licheńskie was found. With a small exception, all the observed results met the expectations predicted by the hypothesis tested. This indicates that topmouth gudgeon retains high phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits even in a habitat with extreme conditions, which is important for the species' invasion success. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	abstract = {Fungi can be the cause of many nosocomial infections. Systemic fungal infections in many cases are targeted at patients or individuals with weak immune system suffering from neutropenia, human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or undergoing chemotherapy and etc. One of the most common systemic fungal infection is caused by the genus Candida from which Candida albicans takes the most significant part. Systemic fungal infections are very dangerous because they cannot be diagnosed by a common trait that characterizes the current pathogen. This is because the fungi can travel through blood and disseminate in any organ and therefore cause a variety of symptoms linked to the affected organ. The early identification of the fungus is critical for an appropriate treatment. In that regard we need to know how to isolate properly the pathogen avoiding false positive results, so that we can identify it. In this overview we will discuss these steps focusing on systemic infections caused by Candida albicans. The genus and is widely spread in all our surroundings, including places that are supposed to be free of contamination as hospitals and others. The genus Candida comprises about 200 species, close to 20 of which are associated with pathology in humans or animals. Various pathological conditions were shown to be associated with yeasts. The fungus was isolated by Bennett in 1844 in the sputum of tuberculosis patients, by Wilkinson in 1849 from vaginal candidiasis, by Robin in 1853 from a systemic infection and by Zenker in 1861 from a brain infection in a debilitated patient in whom the fungus spread hematogenously from an oral infection (1). Similar disease is caused by Geotrichum candidum. Geotrichosis affects mainly patients with systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, leukoses, neoplasms etc. Clinically, it is similar to candidiasis and may occur as an oral, vaginal, skin, or systemic infection (2). Onichomicosis are fungal infections caused by dermatophytes, yeasts and molds. The rapid and qualitative diagnosis of onichomicosis and accurate identifcation of dermatophytes and non dermatophyte molds is necessary because many of the growing number of antimycotic agents have different spectra of activity (3).},

Here, we investigated yearto- year changes from 1989 to 2009 in genetic admixture at 15 microsatellite loci and in phenotypic traits in an Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) population stocked during the first decade of this period with two genetically and phenotypically distinct source populations. We detected a pattern of temporally increasing introgressive hybridization between the stocked population and both source populations. The proportion of fish returning to the river after a single winter at sea (versus several ones) was higher in fish assigned to the main source population than in local individuals. Moreover, during the first decade of the study, both single-sea-winter and multi-sea-winter (MSW) fish assigned to the main source population were smaller than local fish. During the second decade of the study, MSW fish defined as hybrids were lighter and smaller than fish from parental populations, suggesting outbreeding depression. Overall, this study suggests that supplementation with nonlocal individuals may alter not only the genetic diversity of wild populations but also life-history traits of adaptive significance. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Conflict between the sexes over reproductive interests can drive rapid evolution of reproductive traits and promote speciation. Here we show that inter-species mating between Caenorhabditis nematodes sterilizes maternal individuals. The principal effectors of male-induced harm are sperm cells, which induce sterility and shorten lifespan by displacing conspecific sperm, invading the ovary, and sometimes breaching the gonad to infiltrate other tissues. This sperm-mediated harm is pervasive across species, but idiosyncrasies in its magnitude implicate both independent histories of sexually antagonistic coevolution within species and differences in reproductive mode (self-fertilizing hermaphrodites versus females) in determining its severity. Consistent with this conclusion, in androdioecious species the hermaphrodites are more vulnerable, the males more benign, or both. Patterns of assortative mating and a low incidence of invasive sperm occurring with conspecific mating are indicative of ongoing intra-specific sexual conflict that results in inter-species reproductive incompatibility. © 2014 Ting et al.},

These microbes can vastly outnumber the eukaryotic cells of “macrobes” that they inhabit and are increasingly recognized as playing major roles in the health and disease of their hosts. Most plant functional traits that connect plants to ecosystems are determined in part or in whole by associated microbes, but we require many more studies to draw general conclusions. In particular, all root functional traits studied to date can be altered by microbes; some of the underlying pathways connecting microbes and root architecture are discussed. The functional trait framework provides a conceptual basis for linking plant–microbe interactions to ecosystem processes and services. Microbial influences on plant functional traits can fundamentally alter plant ecology and evolution. By altering plants' interactions with abiotic factors, competitors, herbivores, and other mutualists, microbes can expand or contract plant niches and alter patterns of invasion and community diversity. If plants and microbes experience fitness conflict over functional trait values, ecosystem function could be impacted through antagonistic coevolution. Mechanisms that align host and symbiont fitness are beginning to be elucidated and further work is needed to assess the fitness consequences of functional trait variation for both parties. Ultimately, understanding the response of ecosystems to global change will require quantification of microbes' impact on plant traits. © 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the current classification and identification of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species with exclusive or predominant host specificity for humans. Haemophilus influenzae and some of the other Haemophilus species are commonly encountered in the clinical microbiology laboratory and demonstrate a wide range of pathogenicity, from life-threatening invasive disease to respiratory infections to a nonpathogenic, commensal lifestyle. New species of Haemophilus have been described (Haemophilus pittmaniae and Haemophilus sputorum), and the new genus Aggregatibacter was created to accommodate some former Haemophilus and Actinobacillus species (Aggregatibacter aphrophilus, Aggregatibacter segnis, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). Aggregatibacter species are now a dominant etiology of infective endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms (HACEK endocarditis), and A. aphrophilus has emerged as an important cause of brain abscesses. Correct identification of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter species based on phenotypic characterization can be challenging. It has become clear that 15 to 20% of presumptive H. influenzae isolates from the respiratory tracts of healthy individuals do not belong to this species but represent nonhemolytic variants of Haemophilus haemolyticus. Due to the limited pathogenicity of H. haemolyticus, the proportion of misidentified strains may be lower in clinical samples, but even among invasive strains, a misidentification rate of 0.5 to 2% can be found. Several methods have been investigated for differentiation of H. influenzae from its less pathogenic relatives, but a simple method for reliable discrimination is not available. With the implementation of identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the more rarely encountered species of Haemophilus and Aggregatibacter will increasingly be identified in clinical microbiology practice. However, identification of some strains will still be problematic, necessitating DNA sequencing of multiple housekeeping gene fragments or full-length 16S rRNA genes. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Heterotrophic bacteria play a major role in organic matter cycling in the ocean. Although the high abundances and relatively fast growth rates of coastal surface bacterioplankton make them suitable sentinels of global change, past analyses have largely overlooked this functional group. Here, time series analysis of a decade of monthly observations in temperate Atlantic coastal waters revealed strong seasonal patterns in the abundance, size and biomass of the ubiquitous flow-cytometric groups of low (LNA) and high nucleic acid (HNA) content bacteria. Over this relatively short period, we also found that bacterioplankton cells were significantly smaller, a trend that is consistent with the hypothesized temperature-driven decrease in body size. Although decadal cell shrinking was observed for both groups, it was only LNA cells that were strongly coherent, with ecological theories linking temperature, abundance and individual size on both the seasonal and interannual scale. We explain this finding because, relative to their HNA counterparts, marine LNA bacteria are less diverse, dominated by members of the SAR11 clade. Temperature manipulation experiments in 2012 confirmed a direct effect of warming on bacterial size. Concurrent with rising temperatures in spring, significant decadal trends of increasing standing stocks (3% per year) accompanied by decreasing mean cell size (-1% per year) suggest a major shift in community structure, with a larger contribution of LNA bacteria to total biomass. The increasing prevalence of these typically oligotrophic taxa may severely impact marine foodwebs and carbon fluxes by an overall decrease in the efficiency of the biological pump. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Owing to complex direct and indirect effects, impacts of higher trophic levels on plants is poorly understood. In tropical agroecosystems, ants interactwith crop mutualists and antagonists, but little is known about how this integrates into the final ecosystem service, crop yield. We combined ant exclusion and introduction of invasive and native-dominant species in cacao agroecosystems to test whether (i) ant exclusion reduces yield, (ii) dominant species maximize certain intermediate ecosystem services (e.g. control of specific pests) rather than yield, which depends on several, cascading intermediate services and (iii) even, species-rich ant communities result in highest yields. Ants provided services, including reduced leaf herbivory and fruit pest damage and indirect pollination facilitation, but also disservices, such as increased mealybug density, phytopathogen dissemination and indirect pest damage enhancement. Yields were highest with unmanipulated, species-rich, even communities, whereas ant exclusion decreased yield by 27%. Introduction of an invasivedominant ant decreased species density and evenness and resulted in 34% lower yields,whereas introduction of a non-invasive-dominant species resulted in similar species density and yields as in the unmanipulated control. Species traits and ant community structure affect services and disservices for agriculture in surprisingly complex ways, with species-rich and even communities promoting highest yield. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Marked impacts of climate change on biodiversity have frequently been demonstrated, including temperature-related shifts in phenology and life-history traits. One potential major impact of climate change is the modification of synchronization between the phenology of different trophic levels. High phenotypic plasticity in laying date has allowed many bird species to track the increasingly early springs resulting from recent environmental change, but although changes in the timing of reproduction have been well studied in birds, these questions have only recently been addressed in mammals. To track peak resource availability, large herbivores like roe deer, with a widespread distribution across Europe, should also modify their life-history schedule in response to changes in vegetation phenology over time. In this study, we analysed the influence of climate change on the timing of roe deer births and the consequences for population demography and individual fitness. Our study provides a rare quantification of the demographic costs associated with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a changing world. Given these fitness costs, the lack of response of roe deer birth dates to match the increasingly earlier onset of spring is in stark contrast with the marked phenotypic responses to climate change reported in many other mammals. We suggest that the lack of phenotypic plasticity in birth timing in roe deer is linked to its inability to track environmental cues of variation in resource availability for the timing of parturition. © 2014 Plard et al.},

	abstract = {A 'dark morph' melanic strain of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, was studied for its atypical, heightened resistance to infection with the entomo-pathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana. We show that these insects exhibit multiple intraspecific immunity and physiological traits that distinguish them from a non-melanic, fungus-susceptible morph. The melanic and non-melanic morphs were geographical variants that had evolved different, independent defence strategies. Melanic morphs exhibit a thickened cuticle, higher basal expression of immunity- and stress-management-related genes, higher numbers of circulating haemocytes, upregulated cuticle phenoloxidase (PO) activity concomitant with conidial invasion, andanenhanced capacitytoencap-sulate fungal particles. These insects prioritize specific augmentations to those frontline defences that are most likely to encounter invading pathogens or to sustain damage. Other immune responses that target late-stage infection, such as haemolymph lysozyme and PO activities, do not contribute to fungal tolerance. The net effect is increased larval survival times, retarded cuticular fungal penetration and a lower propensity to develop haemolymph infections when challenged naturally (topically) and by injection. In the absence of fungal infection, however, the heavy defence investments made by melanic insects result in a lower biomass, decreased longevity and lower fecundity in comparison with their non-melanic counterparts. Although melanism is clearly correlated with increased fungal resistance, the costly mechanisms enabling this protective trait constitute more than just a colour change. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Plants are at the trophic base of terrestrial ecosystems, and the diversity of plant species in an ecosystem is a principle determinant of community structure. This may arise from diverse functional traits among species. In fact, genetic diversity within species can have similarly large effects. However, studies of intraspecific genetic diversity have used genotypes varying in several complex traits, obscuring the specific phenotypic variation responsible for community-level effects. Using lines of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata genetically altered in specific well-characterized defense traits and planted into experimental populations in their native habitat, we investigated community-level effects of trait diversity in populations of otherwise isogenic plants. We conclude that the frequency of defense traits in a population can determine the outcomes of these traits for individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that some ecosystem-level services afforded by genetically diverse plant populations could be recaptured in intensive monocultures engineered to be functionally diverse. © Schuman et al.},

	abstract = {The seasonal timing of lifecycle events is closely linked to individual fitness and hence, maladaptation in phenological traits may impact population dynamics. However, few studies have analysed whether and why climate change will alter selection pressures and hence possibly induce maladaptation in phenology. To fill this gap, we here use a theoretical modelling approach. In our models, the phenologies of consumer and resource are (potentially) environmentally sensitive and depend on two different but correlated environmental variables. Fitness of the consumer depends on the phenological match with the resource. Because we explicitly model the dependence of the phenologies on environmental variables, we can test how differential (heterogeneous) versus equal (homogeneous) rates of change in the environmental variables affect selection on consumer phenology. As expected, under heterogeneous change, phenotypic plasticity is insufficient and thus selection on consumer phenology arises. However, even homogeneous change leads to directional selection on consumer phenology. This is because the consumer reaction norm has historically evolved to be flatter than the resource reaction norm, owing to time lags and imperfect cue reliability. Climate change will therefore lead to increased selection on consumer phenology across a broad range of situations. © 2014 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The understanding of how normal cells transform into tumor cells and progress to invasive cancer and metastases continues to evolve. The tumor mass is comprised of a heterogeneous population of cells that include recruited host immune cells, stromal cells, matrix components, and endothelial cells. This tumor microenvironment plays a fundamental role in the acquisition of hallmark traits, and has been the intense focus of current research. A key regulatory mechanism triggered by these tumor-stroma interactions includes processes that resemble epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a physiologic program that allows a polarized epithelial cell to undergo biochemical and cellular changes and adopt mesenchymal cell characteristics. These cellular adaptations facilitate enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased production of ECM components. Indeed, it has been postulated that cancer cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition to invade and metastasize. In the following discussion, the physiology of chronic inflammation, wound healing, fibrosis, and tumor invasion will be explored. The key regulatory cytokines transforming growth factor-β and osteopontin and their roles in cancer metastasis will be highlighted. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is one of the major plant nutrients whose deficiency results in severe losses to crop yields. To achieve optimum crop production, P is, therefore, consistently required. The use of chemical fertilizers in contrast is discouraged for two basic reasons: one, the repeated and injudicious application may alter soil fertility by adversely affecting microbial composition and functions and, second, it is expensive. To address these problems, scientists have identified soil-borne microorganisms belonging to a specific functional group generally referred to as phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) which play many ecophysiological roles, especially in providing plants with P. They can be found in any environment from conventional to contaminated ones and are able to express their activity both in vitro and under field conditions. The solubilization of P by bacteria including even some of the strict nitrogen fixers, for example, rhizobia (symbiotic) or Azotobacter (asymbiotic), is a multifactor process. The ability to release bound P from both organic (enzymatic) and inorganic (acidification) sources by this functionally diverse group of organisms and to provide growth regulators (phytohormones) to plants or protecting plants from various diseases through other mechanisms (such as synthesizing antibiotics, siderophores, cyanogenic compounds, etc.) is indeed some of the most fascinating biological traits that have resulted in increased crop yields. Here, we highlight the functional aspects of PS bacteria especially their role in crop improvement particularly legumes and cereals grown in varied agro-ecological regions. The discussion attempted here is likely to serve as a low-cost prospective option for sustainable agriculture and also to solve economic constraint to considerable extent faced by the farming communities. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

	abstract = {Global warming is increasing the overheating risk for many organisms, though the potential for plasticity in thermal tolerance to mitigate this risk is largely unknown. In part, this shortcoming stems from a lack of knowledge about global and taxonomic patterns of variation in tolerance plasticity. To address this critical issue, we test leading hypotheses for broad-scale variation in ectotherm tolerance plasticity using a dataset that includes vertebrate and invertebrate taxa from terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. Contrary to expectation, plasticity in heat tolerance was unrelated to latitude or thermal seasonality. However, plasticity in cold tolerance is associated with thermal seasonality in some habitat types. In addition, aquatic taxa have approximately twice the plasticity of terrestrial taxa. Based on the observed patterns of variation in tolerance plasticity, we propose that limited potential for behavioural plasticity (i.e. behavioural thermoregulation) favours the evolution of greater plasticity in physiological traits, consistent with the ‘Bogert effect’. Finally, we find that all ectotherms have relatively lowacclimation in thermal tolerance and demonstrate that overheating risk will be minimally reduced by acclimation in even the most plastic groups. Our analysis indicates that behavioural and evolutionary mechanisms will be critical in allowing ectotherms to buffer themselves from extreme temperatures. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Biological invasions are the main causes of emerging viral diseases and they favour the co-occurrence of multiple species or strains in the same environment. Depending on the nature of the interaction, co-occurrence can lead to competitive exclusion or coexistence. The successive fortuitous introductions of two strains of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV-Mld and TYLCV-IL) in Réunion Island provided an ideal opportunity to study the invasion of, and competition between, these worldwide emerging pathogens. During a 7-year field survey, we observed a displacement of the resident TYLCV-Mld by the newcomer TYLCV-IL, with TYLCV-Mld remaining mostly in co-infected plants. To understand the factors associated with this partial displacement, biological traits related to fitness were measured. The better ecological aptitude of TYLCV-IL in single infections was demonstrated, which explains its rapid spread. However, we demonstrate that the relative fitness of virus strains can drastically change between single infections and co-infections. An epidemiological model parametrized with our experimental data predicts that the two strains will coexist in the long run through assistance by the fitter strain. This rare case of unilateral facilitation between two pathogens leads to frequency-dependent selection and maintenance of the less fit strain. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Over the years, researchers have used presumptively neutral molecular variation to infer the origins of current species' distributions in northern latitudes (especially Europe). However, several reported examples of genic and chromosomal replacements suggest that end-glacial colonizations of particular northern areas may have involved genetic input from different source populations at different times, coupled with competition and selection. We investigate the functional consequences of differences between two bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) haemoglobins deriving from different glacial refugia, one of which partially replaced the other in Britain during end-glacial climate warming. This allows us to examine their adaptive divergence and hence a possible role of selection in the replacement. We determine the amino acid substitution Ser52Cys in the major expressed β-globin gene as the allelic difference. We use structural modelling to reveal that the protein environment renders the 52Cys thiol a highly reactive functional group and we show its reactivity in vitro. We demonstrate that possessing the reactive thiol in haemoglobin increases the resistance of bank vole erythrocytes to oxidative stress. Our study thus provides striking evidence for physiological differences between products of genic variants that spread at the expense of one another during colonization of an area from different glacial refugia. © 2014 The Author(s).},

In addition, the importance of regional and structural differences grows in our modern world. Little is known, though, about the consequences when traits of a disease vary regionally. In this paper, we study the effect of a spatially varying per capita infection rate on the behaviour of livestock diseases. We show that the prevalence of an infectious livestock disease in a community of animals can paradoxically decrease owing to transport connections to other communities in which the risk of infection is higher. We study the consequences for the design of livestock transportation restriction measures and establish exact criteria to discriminate those connections that increase the level of infection in the community from those that decrease it. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Recent works conducted in Senegalese and Gambian coastal marine, estuarine and freshwater ecosystems have shown important changes in the intensity, frequency and breeding timing of wild population of Sarotherodon melanotheron in response to changes in salinity regimes. In addition to salinity, this study investigates the potential influences of other environmental factors that have received less attention on the reproduction of S. melanotheron from three different aquatic ecosystems in Senegal. The results demonstrate that day-length and temperature affect sexual maturity in both males and females from Guiers Lake and Hann Bay, but no such effects were found in upstream of the Saloum Estuary, where the spawning activity seems to be under the synergetic control of rainfall and salinity that apparently predominate over all the other ambient factors. This study demonstrated for the first time that aside from photoperiod and temperature, rainfall also influences fish reproduction in Hann Bay probably through its effects on water quality. Furthermore, our results confirm previous findings that changes in salinity regimes resulting from seasonal variations in precipitation and evaporation are the ultimate causes of temporal changes in the reproductive activity of the species in this estuary. © 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS on behalf of Académie des sciences.},

Recent evidence suggests that Drosophilaspecies with restricted tropical distributions lack genetic variation in the key trait of desiccation resistance. It has therefore been predicted that tropically restricted species will be limited in their evolutionary response to future climatic changes and will face higher risks of extinction. However, these assessments have been made using extreme levels of desiccation stress (less than 10% relative humidity (RH)) that extend well beyond the changes projected for the wet tropics under climate change scenarios over the next 30 years. Here, we show that significant evolutionary responses to less extreme (35% RH) but more ecologically realistic levels of climatic change and desiccation stress are in fact possible in two species of rainforest restricted Drosophila. Evolution may indeed be an important means by which sensitive rainforest-restricted species are able to mitigate the effects of climate change. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Dispersal during juvenile life stages drives the life-history evolution and dynamics of many marine vertebrate populations. However, the movements of juvenile organisms, too small to track using conventional satellite telemetry devices, remain enigmatic. For sea turtles, this led to the paradigm of the ‘lost years’ since hatchlings disperse widely with ocean currents. Recently, advances in the miniaturization of tracking technology have permitted the application of nano-tags to track cryptic organisms. Here, the novel use of acoustic nano-tags on neonate loggerhead turtle hatchlings enabled us to witness first-hand their dispersal and behaviour during their first day at sea. We tracked hatchlings distances of up to 15 km and documented their rapid transport (up to 60 m min-1) with surface current flows passing their natal areas. Tracking was complemented with laboratory observations to monitor swimming behaviours over longer periods which highlighted (i) a positive correlation between swimming activity levels and body size and (ii) population-specific swimming behaviours (e.g. nocturnal inactivity) suggesting local oceanic conditions drive the evolution of innate swimming behaviours. Knowledge of the swimming behaviours of small organisms is crucial to improve the accuracy of ocean model simulations used to predict the fate of these organisms and determine resultant population-level implications into adulthood. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {About 60 % of the earth's available nitrogen is fixed via biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Being a major contributor to BNF, Rhizobium -legume symbiosis can provide well over half of the biological source of fixed nitrogen. Actually, Rhizobium - legume symbiosis results in the formation of nodules on legume roots where rhizobia fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. But nodulation and nitrogen fixation is a complex process and is dependent on the compatibility and potential of both partners of Rhizobium -legume symbiosis under variable soil and environmental conditions. Although, some selected efficient and effective traits of rhizobia and legumes have shown encouraging results, there is a need of consistent positive influence on nodulation and nitrogen fixation to maximize the growth and yield of legumes under variable conditions. Hence, the use of means capable of improving both the legume growth and the growth and function of symbiotic rhizobia is essential. Co-inoculation of Rhizobium species with favorably interacting traits of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is considered an applied, cost-effective, efficient, and environment-friendly approach to further improve legume growth and productivity under variable conditions because they can provide broad spectrum mechanisms of actions and improve reliability of inocula without genetic engineering. In addition, these PGPR when used in combination with rhizobia have also shown the strategies for dealing with stressful conditions like salinity, pH, temperature, drought, heavy metal, and pathogens which could further impose limitations on the capacity of Rhizobium -legume symbiosis. This chapter highlights various PGPR traits compatible with specific legume rhizobia and their phytostimulatory mechanisms contributing to augmentation in rhizobial growth and function for growth and yield enhancement of legumes under variable conditions. © Springer India 2013.

Here, we review the opportunities presented by biodiversity time series, and address three related issues: (i) recognizing the characteristics of temporal data; (ii) selecting appropriate statistical procedures for analysing temporal data; and (iii) inferring and forecasting biodiversity change. With regard to the first issue, we draw attention to defining characteristics of biodiversity time series-lack of physical boundaries, unidimensionality, autocorrelation and directionality-that inform the choice of analytic methods. Second, we explore methods of quantifying change in biodiversity at different timescales, noting that autocorrelation can be viewed as a feature that sheds light on the underlying structure of temporal change. Finally, we address the transition from inferring to forecasting biodiversity change, highlighting potential pitfalls associated with phase-shifts and novel conditions. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Sexual selection of high-quality mates can conflict with species recognition if traits that govern intraspecific mate preferences also influence interspecific recognition. This conflict might be resolved by developmental plasticity and learned mate preferences, which could drive preference divergence in populations that differ in local species composition. We integrate field and laboratory experiments on two calopterygid damselfly species with population genetic data to investigate how sex differences in developmental plasticity affect population divergence in the face of gene flow. Whereas male species recognition is fixed at emergence, females instead learn to recognize hetero-specifics. Females are therefore more plastic in their mate preferences than males. We suggest that this results from sex differences in the balance between sexual selection for high-quality mates and selection for species recognition. As a result of these sex differences, females develop more pronounced population divergence in their mate preferences compared with males. Local ecological community context and presence of heterospecifics in combination with sex differences in plasticity and canalization therefore shape population divergence in mate preferences. As ongoing environmental change and habitat fragmentation bring formerly allopatric species into secondary contact, developmental plasticity of mate preferences in either or both sexes might facilitate coexistence and prevent local species extinction. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Climate change has the potential to influence the persistence of ecological communities by altering their stability properties. One of the major drivers of community stability is species diversity, which is itself expected to be altered by climate change in many systems. The extent to which climatic effects on community stability may be buffered by the influence of species interactions on diversity is, however, poorly understood because of a paucity of studies incorporating interactions between abiotic and biotic factors. Here, I report results of a 10-year field experiment, the past 7 years of which have focused on effects of ongoing warming and herbivore removal on diversity and stability within the plant community, where competitive species interactions are mediated by exploitation through herbivory. Across the entire plant community, stability increased with diversity, but both stability and diversity were reduced by herbivore removal, warming and their interaction. Within the most species-rich functional group in the community, forbs, warming reduced species diversity, and both warming and herbivore removal reduced the strength of the relationship between diversity and stability. Species interactions, such as exploitation, may thus buffer communities against destabilizing influences of climate change, and intact populations of large herbivores, in particular, may prove important in maintaining and promoting plant community diversity and stability in a changing climate. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Since its introduction in Chile, the European Bombus terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) has progressively reduced the abundance of the native Patagonian bumblebee, Bombus dahlbomii Guérin. Because an important cause of successful invasion of a species may depend on a potentially advantageous phenotype, we studied morphologies related to flight performance (flight muscle ratio (FMR), wing loading (WL), excess power index (EPI, which integrates FMR and WL) and wing aspect ratio (AR)) in the queens of the two species. Previous empirical studies showed that greater FMR, AR and EPI, and lower WL increase flight performance. In the Patagonian Chilean fjord where the study was carried out, B. dahlbomii was 40% heavier than B. terrestris, a difference theoretically allowing the queens of the native species to take off with heavier loads, despite the fact that the two species have virtually identical FMRs. However, FMR negatively depended on body mass at the intra-specific level. The total wing area was 35% greater in B. dahlbomii , but the difference in forewing length was only of 16%. Once taken into account the effect of body size, WL, was significantly lower in B. terrestris. AR increased with body mass and did not differ between species. EPI was weakly but significantly higher in B. terrestris. Experiments formally linking such parameters with flight performance may help to explain the observed quick and wide spread of this alien species in Patagonia in the last few years. © 2014 Académie des sciences.

	abstract = {Selective logging is one of the most common forms of forest use in the tropics.Although the effects of selective logging on biodiversity have been widely studied, there is little agreement on the relationship between life-history traits and tolerance to logging. In this study, we assessed how species traits and logging practices combine to determine species responses to selective logging, based on over 4000 observations of the responses of nearly 1000 bird species to selective logging across the tropics. Our analysis shows that species traits, such as feeding group and body mass, and logging practices, such as time since logging and logging intensity, interact to influence a species’ response to logging. Frugivores and insectivores were most adversely affected by logging and declined further with increasing logging intensity. Nectarivores and granivores responded positively to selective logging for the first two decades, after which their abundances decrease below pre-logging levels. Larger species of omnivores and granivores responded more positively to selective logging than smaller species from either feeding group, whereas this effect of body size was reversed for carnivores, herbivores, frugivores and insectivores. Most importantly, species most negatively impacted by selective logging had not recovered approximately 40 years after logging cessation. We conclude that selective timber harvest has the potential to cause large and long-lasting changes in avian biodiversity.However, our results suggest that the impacts can bemitigated to a certain extent through specific forest management strategies such as lengthening the rotation cycle and implementing reduced impact logging. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {We investigate how the loss of previously evolved diversity in host resistance to disease is dependent on the complexity of the underlying evolutionary trade-off. Working within the adaptive dynamics framework, using graphical tools (pairwise invasion plots, PIPs; trait evolution plots, TEPs) and algebraic analysis we consider polynomial trade-offs of increasing degree. Our focus is on the evolutionary trajectory of the dimorphic population after it has been attracted to an evolutionary branching point. We show that for sufficiently complex trade-offs (here, polynomials of degree three or higher) the resulting invasion boundaries can form closed 'oval' areas of invadability and strategy coexistence. If no attracting singular strategies exist within this region, then the population is destined to evolve outside of the region of coexistence, resulting in the loss of one strain. In particular, the loss of diversity in this model always occurs in such a way that the remaining strain is not attracted back to the branching point but to an extreme of the trade-off, meaning the diversity is lost forever. We also show similar results for a non-polynomial but complex trade-off, and for a different eco-evolutionary model. Our work further highlights the importance of trade-offs to evolutionary behaviour. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the climate conditions governing spatial variation in the reproductive performance of plants can provide important information about the factors characterizing plant community structure, especially in the context of climate change. This study focuses on the effect of climate on the sexual reproductive output of Dactylis glomerata L., a perennial grass species widely distributed throughout temperate regions. An indirect space-for-time substitution procedure was used. Sixty mountain populations of the same target species were surveyed along an elevation gradient, and then, a relevant climate model was used to infer a potential response to climate change over time. Within each population, information on the number of stems, seed number and seed mass were collected. Resource investment in reproduction (RIR) was quantified as seed number × seed mass. A clear variation was found in the reproductive performance of D. glomerata along the elevational gradient: RIR improved with increasing temperature. The best model included only one term: the maximum temperature of the warmest month. This study demonstrates that mountain ecosystems offer particularly good opportunities to study climate effects over relatively short distances and suggests that warming will enhance D. glomerata's reproductive output throughout its elevational range. Furthermore, it can be hypothesized that a potential migration of D. glomerata toward higher altitudes may occur in response to accelerated climate change. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Climate change has differentially affected the timing of seasonal events for interacting trophic levels, and this has often led to increased selection on seasonal timing. Yet, the environmental variables driving this selection have rarely been identified, limiting our ability to predict future ecological impacts of climate change. Using a dataset spanning 31 years from a natural population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), we show that directional selection on timing of reproduction intensified in the first two decades (1980–2000) but weakened during the last decade (2001–2010). Against expectation, this pattern could not be explained by the temporal variation in the phenological mismatch with food abundance. We therefore explored an alternative hypothesis that selection on timing was affected by conditions individuals experience when arriving in spring at the breeding grounds: arriving early in cold conditions may reduce survival. First, we show that in female recruits, spring arrival date in the first breeding year correlates positively with hatch date; hence, early-hatched individuals experience colder conditions at arrival than late-hatched individuals. Second, we show that when temperatures at arrival in the recruitment year were high, early-hatched young had a higher recruitment probability than when temperatures were low. We interpret this as a potential cost of arriving early in colder years, and climate warming may have reduced this cost. We thus show that higher temperatures in the arrival year of recruits were associated with stronger selection for early reproduction in the years these birds were born. As arrival temperatures in the beginning of the study increased, but recently declined again, directional selection on timing of reproduction showed a nonlinear change. We demonstrate that environmental conditions with a lag of up to two years can alter selection on phenological traits in natural populations, something that has important implications for our understanding of how climate can alter patterns of selection in natural populations. © 2015 Visser et al.},

The vast majority of studies conducted to date have comprised static analyses where communities are observed at a single snapshot in time. Long-term datasets present a vantage point to compare established and emerging theoretical predictions on the phylogenetic and functional trajectoryof communities through succession. We investigated within, and between, community measures of phylogenetic and functional diversity in a fire-prone heathland along a 21 year time series. Contrary to widely held expectations that increased competition through succession should inhibit the coexistence of species with high niche overlap, plots became more phylogenetically and functionally clustered with time since fire. There were significant directional shifts in individual traits through time indicating deterministic successional processes associated with changing abiotic and/or biotic conditions. However, relative to the observed temporal rate of taxonomic turnover, both phylogenetic and functional turnover were comparatively low, suggesting a degree of functional redundancy among close relatives. These results contribute to an emerging body of evidence indicating that limits to the similarity of coexisting species are rarely observed at fine spatial scales. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Whether species adopting such a strategy differ in their response to global changes remains, however, unknown. Both the absence of investment in parental care and the capacity to spread nesting failure by laying eggs in several nests might help brood parasites in dealing with environmental changes. Alternatively, brood parasites might cumulate the negative effects of environmental changes on their own environment and on their hosts' environment. Here, I tested whether brood parasites' extinction risk and population trend differed from those of species with parental care. Focusing on the five bird families containing brood parasite species, I show that brood parasites are less at risk of extinction, and have a more stable population trend than species with parental care. In addition, I found that brood parasites with a higher host diversity were more likely to be increasing than those with fewer hosts. The bet-hedging strategy of brood parasites, by allowing them to spread nesting failure risks associated with environmental changes, is likely to help them resist current global changes. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Fresh water availability for agricultural use is a growing concern across the United States as well as many regions of the world. Short-term drought events along with regulatory intervention in the regulation of water availability coupled with the looming threat of long-term climate shifts that may lead to reduced precipitation in many important agricultural regions has increased the need to hasten the development of crops adapted for improved water use efficiency in order to maintain or expand production in the coming years. This protocol is not meant as a step-by-step guide to identifying at either the physiological or molecular level drought-tolerance traits in lettuce, but rather is a method developed and refined through the screening of thousands of different lettuce varieties. The nature of this screen is based in part on the streamlined measurements focusing on only three water-stress indicators: leaf relative water content, wilt, and differential plant growth following drought-stress. The purpose of rapidly screening a large germplasm collection is to narrow the candidate pool to a point in which more intensive physiological, molecular, and genetic methods can be applied to identify specific drought-tolerant traits in either the lab or field. Candidates can also be directly incorporated into breeding programs as a source of drought-tolerance traits. © 2015 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License.},

	abstract = {The study of microbial communities often leads to arguments for the evolution of cooperation due to group benefits. However, multilevel selection models caution against the uncritical assumption that group benefits will lead to the evolution of cooperation. We analyze a microbial social trait to precisely define the conditions favoring cooperation. We combine the multilevel partition of the Price equation with a laboratory model system: swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We parameterize a population dynamics model using competition experiments where we manipulate expression, and therefore the cost-to-benefit ratio of swarming cooperation. Our analysis shows that multilevel selection can favor costly swarming cooperation because it causes population expansion. However, due to high costs and diminishing returns constitutive cooperation can only be favored by natural selection when relatedness is high. Regulated expression of cooperative genes is a more robust strategy because it provides the benefits of swarming expansion without the high cost or the diminishing returns. Our analysis supports the key prediction that strong group selection does not necessarily mean that microbial cooperation will always emerge. © 2013 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

	abstract = {This chapter reviews how waterborne myxozoan stages achieve transmission to vertebrate hosts, a process that depends on attachment to a host and subsequent invasion. Such transmission has largely been examined for actinospores that are produced by myxosporeans infecting annelid hosts, but we also consider malacosporean stages released from freshwater bryozoan hosts where possible. We review the functional morphology of spores and how this relates to the invasion process and consider cues that initiate the discharge of polar capsule filaments for attachment and sporoplasm activation. We summarize initial invasion steps and discuss factors that may influence transmission ranging from spore viability and infectivity to host cues. We also describe what is known about portals of entry to fish hosts and how non-specific host recognition may enable some myxosporeans to infect a broad range of hosts. Such non-specificity could promote diversification if speciation follows the acquisition of new hosts. We conclude by recommending experimental procedures to be adopted when handling and harvesting actinospores for experimental studies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {Under global change, populations have four possible responses: ‘migrate, acclimate, adapt or die’ (Gienapp et al. 2008 Climate change and evolution: disentangling environmental and genetic response. Mol. Ecol. 17, 167–178. (doi:10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03413.x)). The challenge is to predict how much migration, acclimatization or adaptation populations are capable of. We have previously shown that populations from more variable environments are more plastic (Schaum et al. 2013 Variation in plastic responses of a globally distributed picoplankton species to ocean acidification. Nature 3, 298–230. (doi:10.1038/nclimate1774)), and here we use experimental evolution with a marine microbe to learn that plastic responses predict the extent of adaptation in the face of elevated partial pressure of CO2(pCO2). Specifically, plastic populations evolvemore, and plastic responses in traits other than growth can predict changes in growth in a marine microbe. The relationship between plasticity and evolution is strongest when populations evolve in fluctuating environments, which favour the evolution and maintenance of plasticity. Strikingly, plasticity predicts the extent, but not direction of phenotypic evolution. The plastic response to elevated pCO2 in green algae is to increase cell division rates, but the evolutionary response here is to decrease cell division rates over 400 generations until cells are dividing at the samerate theirancestors did inambient CO2. Slow-growing cells have higher mitochondrial potential and withstand further environmental change better than faster growing cells. Based on this, we hypothesize that slow growth is adaptive under CO2 enrichment when associated with the production of higher quality daughter cells. © 2014 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Insects have been extraordinarily successful in occupying terrestrial habitats, in contrast to their mostly aquatic sister group, the crustaceans. This success is typically attributed to adult traits such as flight, whereas little attention has been paid to adaptation of the egg. An evolutionary novelty of insect eggs is the serosa, an extraembryonic membrane that enfolds the embryo and secretes a cuticle. To experimentally test the protective function of the serosa, we exploit an exceptional possibility to eliminate this membrane by zerknüllt1 RNAi in the beetle Tribolium castaneum. We analyse hatching rates of eggs under a range of humidities and find dramatically decreasing hatching rates with decreasing humidities for serosa-less eggs, but not for control eggs. Furthermore, we show serosal expression of Tc-chitin-synthase1 and demonstrate that its knockdown leads to absence of the serosal cuticle and a reduction in hatching rates at low humidities. These developmental genetic techniques in combination with ecological testing provide experimental evidence for a crucial role of the serosa in desiccation resistance.We propose that the origin of this extraembryonic membrane facilitated the spectacular radiation of insects on land, as did the origin of the amniote egg in the terrestrial invasion of vertebrates. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {In migratory birds, arrival date and hatching date are two key phonological markers that have responded to global warming. A body of knowledge exists relating these traits to evolutionary pressures. In this study,we formalize this knowledge into general mathematical assumptions, and use them in an ecoevolutionary model. In contrast to previous models, this study novelty accounts for both traits—arrival date and hatching date—and the interdependence between them, revealing when one, the other or both will respond to climate. For all models sharing the assumptions, the following phonological responses will occur. First, if the nestling-prey peak is late enough, hatching is synchronous with, and arrival date evolves independently of, prey phenology. Second, when resource availability constrains the length of the pre-laying period, hatching is adaptively asynchronous with prey phenology. Predictions for both traits comparewell with empirical observations. In response to advancing prey phenology, arrival date may advance, remain unchanged, or even become delayed; the latter occurring when egg-laying resources are only available relatively late in the season. The model shows that asynchronous hatching and unresponsive arrival date are not sufficient evidence that phonological adaptation is constrained. The work provides a framework for exploring microevolution of interdependent phenological traits. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

Although aquarium invaders have the potential to alter ecosystem function, regulation of the trade is minimal and little is known about the ecosystem-level consequences of invasion for all but a small number of aquarium species. Here, we demonstrate how ecological stoichiometry can be used as a framework to identify aquarium invaders with the potential to modify ecosystem processes. We show that explosive growth of an introduced population of stoichiometrically unique, phosphorus (P)-rich catfish in a river in southern Mexico significantly transformed stream nutrient dynamics by altering nutrient storage and remineralization rates. Notably, changes varied between elements; the P-rich fish acted as net sinks of P and net remineralizers of nitrogen. Results from this study suggest species-specific stoichiometry may be insightful for understanding how invasive species modify nutrient dynamics when their population densities and elemental composition differ substantially from native organisms. Risk analysis for potential aquarium imports should consider species traits such as body stoichiometry, which may increase the likelihood that an invasion will alter the structure and function of ecosystems. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This manuscript extends this framework to the context of vector-borne pathogens, with the example of Trypanosoma cruzi (the etiological agent of Chagas[U+05F3] disease) adapting via trade-off among three different infection routes to hosts-stercorarian, vertical, and oral-in response to an epidemiological landscape that involves both hosts and vectors (where, in particular, parasite evolution depends not on parasite density but on relative host and vector densities). Using a fitness measure derived from an invasion reproductive number, this study analyzes several different trade-off scenarios in cycles involving raccoons or woodrats, including a proper three-way trade-off (two independent parameters). Results indicate that selection favors oral transmission to raccoons but classical stercorarian transmission to woodrats even under the same predation rate, with vertical (congenital) transmission favored only when aligned with dominant oral transmission or (at trace levels) under a weak (convex) trade-off. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a primary enteric pathogen infecting both humans and animals. Infection begins with the ingestion of contaminated food or water so that salmo-nellae reach the intestinal epithelium and trigger gastrointestinal disease. In some patients the infection spreads upon invasion of the intestinal epithelium, internalization within phagocytes, and subsequent dissemination. In that case, antimicrobial therapy, based on fluoroquinolones and expanded-spectrum cephalospo-rins as the current drugs of choice, is indicated. To accomplish the pathogenic process, the Salmonella chromosome comprises several virulence mechanisms. The most important virulence genes are those located within the so-called Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs). Thus far, five SPIs have been reported to have a major contribution to pathogenesis. Nonetheless, further virulence traits, such as the pSLT virulence plasmid, adhesins, flagella, and biofilm-related proteins, also contribute to success within the host. Several regulatory mechanisms which synchronize all these elements in order to guarantee bacterial survival have been described. These mechanisms govern the transitions from the different pathogenic stages and drive the pathogen to achieve maximal efficiency inside the host. This review focuses primarily on the virulence armamentarium of this pathogen and the extremely complicated regulatory network controlling its success. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {It is widely recognized that indirect effects due to adaptive behaviors can have important effects on food webs. One consequence may be to change how readily perturbations propagate through the web, because species' behaviors as well as densities may respond to perturbations. It is not well understood which types of behavior are more likely to facilitate versus inhibit propagation of disturbances through a food web, or how this might be affected by the shape of a food web or the patterns of interaction strengths within it. We model two simple, laterally expanded food webs (one with three trophic levels and one with four), and compare how various adaptive behaviors affect the potential for a newly introduced predator to change the equilibrium densities of distant species. Patterns of changes in response to the introduction were qualitatively similar across most models, as were the ways in which patterns of direct interaction strengths affected those responses. Depending on both the web structure and the specific adaptive behavior, the potential for density changes to propagate through the web could be either increased or diminished relative to the no-behavior model. Two behaviors allowed density changes to propagate through a four-level web that precluded such propagation in the no-behavior model, and each of these two behaviors led to qualitatively different patterns of density changes. In the one model (diet choice) in which density changes were able to propagate in both web structures, patterns of density changes differed qualitatively between webs. Some of our results flowed from the fact that behaviors did not interact directly in the systems we considered, so that indirect effects on distant species had to be at least partly density-mediated.

Four levels of osmotic stress (-0.4, -0.6, -0.8 and -1.0 MPa) were created and performances were monitored against a control. Physiological and biochemical stress determining parameters such as malondialdechyde (MDA), proline content, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were compared between seedlings of both genotypes. The results indicated that both genotypes have similar responses at four osmotic potentials for all traits studied. All seedling growth parameters such as germination percentage, root length, shoot length, root and shoot dry weight decreased with increasing osmotic stress. MDA, proline, and H2O2 were found to be increased at different osmotic gradients in comparison to control. Cultivar 1114 was less affected than the interspecific line under these stress conditions. The data observed in the experiments revealed that perennial wild H. mollis can hardly be considered to be an excellent candidate of drought tolerance genes. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary foodweb models are used to build food webs by the repeated addition of new species. Population dynamics leads to the extinction or establishment of a newly added species, and possibly to the extinction of other species. The food web structure that emerges after some time is a highly nontrivial result of the evolutionary and dynamical rules. We investigate the evolutionary food web model introduced by Loeuille and Loreau (2005), which characterizes species by their body mass as the only evolving trait. Our goal is to find the reasons behind the model's remarkable robustness and its capability to generate various and stable networks. In contrast to other evolutionary food web models, this model requires neither adaptive foraging nor allometric scaling of metabolic rates with body mass in order to produce complex networks that do not eventually collapse to trivial structures. Our study shows that this is essentially due to the fact that the difference in niche value between predator and prey as well as the feeding range are constrained so that they remain within narrow limits under evolution. Furthermore, competition between similar species is sufficiently strong, so that a trophic level can accommodate several species. We discuss the implications of these findings and argue that the conditions that stabilize other evolutionary food web models have similar effects because they also prevent the occurrence of extreme specialists or extreme generalists that have in general a higher fitness than species with a moderate niche width. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation is an important feature of the beneficial role played by legume crops in the farming system. This symbiosis is facilitated by a complex chemical signaling process between the host legume plant and rhizobia bacteria. The selection of plant varieties for superior nitrogen-fixing variation may potentially reduce reliance on nitrogenous fertilizers and maintain soil nitrogen in the farming system. Nitrogen fixation may be enhanced through a variety of breeding strategies including improved host-strain compatibility, enhanced nodulation, increased biomass production, use of molecular breeding tools, nitrate-tolerant fixation, and the targeting of selective or indiscriminate nodulation. Despite the benefits of enhanced fixation, targeted breeding has been limited as selection is made difficult by the complexity of factors that would need to be controlled for germplasm screening. Nevertheless, advances in molecular breeding and a deeper understanding of the nodulation process may help unravel the interactions associated with nitrogen fixation. This review discusses the issues related to breeding for N fixation and gives an overview of some of the previous attempts at enhancing this trait. © 2015 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

	abstract = {The secreted Chlamydia protease CPAF cleaves a defined set of mammalian and Chlamydia proteins in vitro. As a result, this protease has been proposed to modulate a range of bacterial and host cellular functions. However, it has recently come into question the extent to which many of its identified substrates constitute bona fide targets of proteolysis in infected host cell rather than artifacts of postlysis degradation. Here, we clarify the role played by CPAF in cellular models of infection by analyzing Chlamydia trachomatis mutants deficient for CPAF activity. Using reverse genetic approaches, we identified two C. trachomatis strains possessing nonsense, loss-of-function mutations in cpa (CT858) and a third strain containing a mutation in type II secretion (T2S) machinery that inhibited CPAF activity by blocking zymogen secretion and subsequent proteolytic maturation into the active hydrolase. HeLa cells infected with T2S- or CPAF- C. trachomatis mutants lacked detectable in vitro CPAF proteolytic activity and were not defective for cellular traits that have been previously attributed to CPAF activity, including resistance to staurosporine-induced apoptosis, Golgi fragmentation, altered NFκB-dependent gene expression, and resistance to reinfection. However, CPAF-deficient mutants did display impaired generation of infectious elementary bodies (EBs), indicating an important role for this protease in the full replicative potential of C. trachomatis. In addition, we provide compelling evidence in live cells that CPAF-mediated protein processing of at least two host protein targets, vimentin filaments and the nuclear envelope protein lamin-associated protein-1 (LAP1), occurs rapidly after the loss of the inclusion membrane integrity, but before loss of plasma membrane permeability and cell lysis. CPAF-dependent processing of host proteins correlates with a loss of inclusion membrane integrity, and so we propose that CPAF plays a role late in infection, possibly during the stages leading to the dismantling of the infected cell prior to the release of EBs during cell lysis. The identification of mutants in a key virulence protease in Chlamydia helps clarify the role that this protease plays in manipulating host cellular functions.

	abstract = {Gene drives may be capable of addressing ecological problems by altering entire populations of wild organisms, but their use has remained largely theoretical due to technical constraints. Here we consider the potential for RNA-guided gene drives based on the CRISPR nuclease Cas9 to serve as a general method for spreading altered traits through wild populations over many generations. We detail likely capabilities, discuss limitations, and provide novel precautionary strategies to control the spread of gene drives and reverse genomic changes. The ability to edit populations of sexual species would offer substantial benefits to humanity and the environment. For example, RNA-guided gene drives could potentially prevent the spread of disease, support agriculture by reversing pesticide and herbicide resistance in insects and weeds, and control damaging invasive species. However, the possibility of unwanted ecological effects and near-certainty of spread across political borders demand careful assessment of each potential application. We call for thoughtful, inclusive, and well-informed public discussions to explore the responsible use of this currently theoretical technology. © Esvelt et al.},

	abstract = {A general prediction of ecological theory is that climate change will favor invasive nonindigenous plant species (NIPS over native species. However, the relative fitness advantage enjoyed by NIPS is often affected by resource limitation and potentially by extreme climatic events such as drought. Genetic constraints may also limit the ability of NIPS to adapt to changing climatic conditions. In this study, we investigated evidence for potential NIPS advantage under climate change in two sympatric perennial stipoid grasses from southeast Australia, the NIPS Nassella neesiana and the native Austrostipa bigeniculata. We compared the growth and reproduction of both species under current and year 2050 drought, temperature and CO2 regimes in a multifactor outdoor climate simulation experiment, hypothesizing that NIPS advantage would be higher under more favorable growing conditions. We also compared the quantitative variation and heritability of growth traits in populations of both species collected along a 200 km climatic transect. In contrast to our hypothesis we found that the NIPS N. neesiana was less responsive than A. bigeniculata to winter warming but maintained higher reproductive output during spring drought. However, overall tussock expansion was far more rapid in N. neesiana, and so it maintained an overall fitness advantage over A. bigeniculata in all climate regimes. N. neesiana also exhibited similar or lower quantitative variation and growth trait OPEN ACCESS heritability than A. bigeniculata within populations but greater variability among populations, probably reflecting a complex past introduction history. We found some evidence that additional spring warmth increases the impact of drought on reproduction but not that elevated atmospheric CO2 ameliorates drought severity. Overall, we conclude that NIPS advantage under climate change may be limited by a lack of responsiveness to key climatic drivers, reduced genetic variability in range-edge populations, and complex drought-CO2 interactions. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Adjustment to novel thermal habitats may occur either through behavioural adjustments, physiological adaptation or both. Here, we test whether rates of evolution differ among physiological traits in the cybotoids, a clade of tropical Anolis lizards distributed in markedly different thermal environments on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. We find that cold tolerance evolves considerably faster than heat tolerance, a difference that results because behavioural thermoregulation more effectively shields these organisms from selection on upper than lower temperature tolerances. Specifically, because lizards in very different environments behaviourally thermoregulate during the day to similar body temperatures, divergent selection on body temperature and heat tolerance is precluded, whereas night-time temperatures can only be partially buffered by behaviour, thereby exposing organisms to selection on cold tolerance. We discuss how exposure to selection on physiology influences divergence among tropical organisms and its implications for adaptive evolutionary response to climate warming. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Species distributions have shifted in response to global warming in all major ecosystems on the Earth. Despite cogent evidence for these changes, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and currently imply gradual shifts. Yet there is an increasing appreciation of the role of discrete events in driving ecological change. We show how a marine heat wave (HW) eliminated a prominent habitat-forming seaweed, Scytothalia dorycarpa, at its warm distribution limit, causing a range contraction of approximately 100 km (approx. 5% of its global distribution). Seawater temperatures during the HW exceeded the seaweed's physiological threshold and caused extirpation of marginal populations, which are unlikely to recover owing to life-history traits and oceanographic processes. Scytothalia dorycarpa is an important canopy-forming seaweed in temperate Australia, and loss of the species at its range edge has caused structural changes at the community level and is likely to have ecosystem-level implications. We show that extreme warming events, which are increasing in magnitude and frequency, can force step-wise changes in species distributions in marine ecosystems. As such, return times of these events have major implications for projections of species distributions and ecosystem structure, which have typically been based on gradual warming trends. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Eukaryotic hosts must exhibit control mechanisms to select against ineffective bacterial symbionts. Hosts can minimize infection by less-effective symbionts (partner choice) and can divest of uncooperative bacteria after infection (sanctions). Yet, such host-control traits are predicted to be context dependent, especially if they are costly for hosts to express or maintain. Legumes form symbiosis with rhizobia that vary in symbiotic effectiveness (nitrogen fixation) and can enforce partner choice aswell as sanctions. In nature, legumes acquire fixed nitrogen from both rhizobia and soils, and nitrogen deposition is rapidly enriching soils globally. If soil nitrogen is abundant, we predict host control to be downregulated, potentially allowing invasion of ineffective symbionts. We experimentally manipulated soil nitrogen to examine context dependence in host control. We co-inoculated Lotus strigosus from nitrogen depauperate soils with pairs of Bradyrhizobium strains that vary in symbiotic effectiveness and fertilized plants with either zero nitrogen or growth maximizing nitrogen. We found efficient partner choice and sanctions regardless of nitrogen fertilization, symbiotic partner combination or growth season. Strikingly, host control was efficient even when L. strigosus gained no significant benefit from rhizobial infection, suggesting that these traits are resilient to short-term changes in extrinsic nitrogen, whether natural or anthropogenic. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Land-use change is one of the main drivers of current and likely future biodiversity loss. Therefore, understanding how species are affected by it is crucial to guide conservation decisions. Species respond differently to land-use change, possibly related to their traits. Using pan-tropical data on bird occurrence and abundance across a human land-use intensity gradient, we tested the effects of seven traits on observed responses. A likelihood-based approach allowed us to quantify uncertainty in modelled responses, essential for applying the model to project future change. Compared with undisturbed habitats, the average probability of occurrence of bird species was 7.8 per cent and 31.4 per cent lower, and abundance declined by 3.7 per cent and 19.2 per cent in habitats with low and high human land-use intensity, respectively. Five of the seven traits tested affected the observed responses significantly: long-lived, large, non-migratory, primarily frugivorous or insectivorous forest specialists were both less likely to occur and less abundant in more intensively used habitats than short-lived, small, migratory, nonfrugivorous/ insectivorous habitat generalists. The finding that species responses to land use depend on their traits is important for understanding ecosystem functioning, because species' traits determine their contribution to ecosystem processes. Furthermore, the loss of species with particular traits might have implications for the delivery of ecosystem services. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) coexist in natural environments forming complex infection networks. Recent empirical findings suggest that phage-bacteria infection networks often possess a nested structure such that there is a hierarchical relationship among who can infect whom. Here we consider how nested infection networks may affect phage and bacteria dynamics using a multi-type Lotka-Volterra framework with cross-infection. Analysis of similar models has, in the past, assumed simpler interaction structures as a first step towards tractability. We solve the proposed model, finding trade-off conditions on the life-history traits of both bacteria and viruses that allow coexistence in communities with nested infection networks. First, we find that bacterial growth rate should decrease with increasing defense against infection. Second, we find that the efficiency of viral infection should decrease with host range. Next, we establish a relationship between relative densities and the curvature of life history trade-offs. We compare and contrast the current findings to the "Kill-the-Winner" model of multi-species phage-bacteria communities. Finally, we discuss a suite of testable hypotheses stemming from the current model concerning relationships between infection range, life history traits and coexistence in complex phage-bacteria communities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Non-genetic transmission of information across generations, so-called parental effects, can have significant impacts on offspring morphology, physiology, behaviour and life-history traits. In previous experimental work using the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch, we demonstrated that dispersal distances increase with local density and levels of genetic relatedness. We here show that manipulation of parental and grand-parental density has a significant effect on offspring dispersal distance, of the same order of magnitude as manipulation of offspring density. We demonstrate that offspring exposed to the same density disperse further if they were born to parents exposed to higher density compared with parents exposed to low density. Offspring dispersal distance also increases when grand-parents were exposed to higher density, except for offspring exposed to lowdensities, which disperse at shorter distances whatever the grand-parental density. We also show that offspring from mothers exposed to higher densities were overall larger, which suggests that parents in high densities invest more in individual offspring, enabling them to disperse further. We propose that our findings should be included in models investigating the spread rate of invasive species or when predicting the success of conservation measures of species attempting to track changing climates. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Early seedling growth was evaluated on the basis of the length of the root and leaf at the 6th day of the experiment. QTLs were identified by composite interval mapping method using Windows QTLCartographer 2.5 software. For the traits studied, a total of thirty eight additive QTLs were identified. Seventeen QTLs were mapped in C on chromosomes: 1A, 2A, 7A, 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 2D, 3D, 4D and 6D, while twenty one QTLs were identified in SDr on chromosomes: 1A, 2A, 5A, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 3D, 5D and 6D. Most of the QTLs for GP and early leaf growth parameters were clustered on chromosome 4B (associated with the Rht-B1 marker) both in C and SDr plants.

	abstract = {Humans excel in cooperative exchanges between unrelated individuals. Although this trait is fundamental to the success of our species, its evolution and mechanisms are poorly understood. Other social mammals also build long-term cooperative relationships between non-kin, and recent evidence shows that oxytocin, a hormone involved in parent-offspring bonding, is likely to facilitate non-kin as well as kin bonds. In a population of wild chimpanzees, we measured urinary oxytocin levels following a rare cooperative event-food sharing. Subjects showed higher urinary oxytocin levels after single food-sharing events compared with other types of social feeding, irrespective of previous social bond levels. Also, urinary oxytocin levels following food sharing were higher than following grooming, another cooperative behaviour. Therefore, food sharing in chimpanzees may play a key role in social bonding under the influence of oxytocin. We propose that food-sharing events co-opt neurobiological mechanisms evolved to support mother-infant bonding during lactation bouts, and may act as facilitators of bonding and cooperation between unrelated individuals via the oxytocinergic system across social mammals. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

	abstract = {Understanding/predicting ecological invasions is an important challenge in modern ecology because of their immense economical and ecological costs. Recent studies have revealed that within-species variation in behaviour (i.e. animal personality) can shed light on the invasion process. The general hypothesis is that individuals' personality type may affect their colonization success, suggesting that some individuals might be better invaders than others.We have recently shown that, in the invasive mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), social personality trait was an important indicator of dispersal distance, with more asocial individuals dispersing further. Here, we tested how mean personality within a population, in addition to individual personality type, affect dispersal and settlement decisions in the mosquitofish. We found that individual dispersal tendencies were influenced by the population's mean boldness and sociability score. For example, individuals from populations with more asocial individuals or with more bold individuals are more likely to disperse regardless of their own personality type. We suggest that identifying behavioural traits facilitating invasions, even at the group level, can thus have direct applications in pest management. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

We tested whether and how species responses to climate change are related to the populations locations within the species thermal range. We compared the average 20 year growth rates of 62 terrestrial breeding birds in three European countries along the latitudinal gradient of the species ranges. After controlling for factors already reported to affect bird population trends (habitat specialization, migration distance and body mass), we found that populations breeding close to the species thermal maximum have lower growth rates than those in other parts of the thermal range, while those breeding close to the species thermal minimum have higher growth rates. These results were maintained even after having controlled for the effect of latitude perse. Therefore, the results cannot solely be explained by latitudinal clines linked to the geographical structure in local spring warming. Indeed, we found that populations are not just responding to changes in temperature at the hottest and coolest parts of the species range, but that they show a linear graded response across their European thermal range. We thus provide insights into how populations respond to climate changes. We suggest that projections of future species distributions, and also management options and conservation assessments, cannot be based on the assumption of a uniform response to climate change across a species range or at range edges only. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) has identified climate change, habitat destruction, invasive species, overexploitation and pollution as the major drivers of biodiversity loss and sources of concern for human well-being. Understanding how these drivers operate and interact and how they might be mitigated are among the most pressing questions facing humanity. Here, we show how macrophysiology-the investigation of variation in physiological traits over large geographical, temporal and phylogenetic scales-can contribute significantly to answering these questions. We do so by demonstrating, for each of the MA drivers, how a macrophysiological approach can or has helped elucidate the impacts of these drivers and their interactions. Moreover, we illustrate that a large-scale physiological perspective can provide insights into previously unrecognized threats to diversity, such as the erosion of physiological variation and stress tolerance, which are a consequence of the removal of large species and individuals from the biosphere. In so doing we demonstrate that environmental physiologists have much to offer the scientific quest to resolve major environmental problems. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {It has been proposed that cancer cells, in particular glioma tumour cells, secrete a chemorepellent factor that guides cell migration away from the tumour, facilitating migration and invasion. We present a hybrid continuous-discrete mathematical model of tumour growth and the chemotropism phenomenon to show that such a chemorepellent factor can also act as a promoter of self-metastases, a mechanism for tumour expansion we have previously shown can explain several essential kinetic dependencies of tumour growth. A sufficient criterion for this expansion was found to be the passive migration of peripheral cancer stem and non-stem cells away from the main tumour mass, where migrating cancer stem cells form new clusters. We show here how the introduction of an active repellent trait serves to accelerate peripheral migration and thus, by the self-metastases principle, accelerate tumour growth. These results provide a mechanistic basis for the proposal that chemorepellent action in gliomas may underlie their rapid growth. © The author 2010.

Here, we applied this framework, for the first time, to an animal, the invasive slug, Arion lusitanicus, and tested (i) whether it has a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity compared with a congeneric native slug, Arion fuscus, and (ii) whether it is robust, opportunistic or both. During one year, we exposed specimens of both species to a range of temperatures along an altitudinal gradient (700-2400 m a.s.l.) and to high and low food levels, and we compared the responsiveness of two fitness traits: survival and egg production. During summer, the invasive species had a more adaptive phenotypic plasticity, and at high temperatures and low food levels, it survived better and produced more eggs than A. fuscus, representing the robust phenotype. During winter, A. lusitanicus displayed a less adaptive phenotype than A. fuscus. We show that the framework developed for plants is also very useful for a better mechanistic understanding of animal invasions. Warmer summers and milder winters might lead to an expansion of this invasive species to higher altitudes and enhance its spread in the lowlands, supporting the concern that global climate change will increase biological invasions. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Gene flow and effective population size (Ne) should depend on a population's position within its range: those near the edges are expected to have smaller Ne and lower relative emigration rates, whereas those nearer the centre should have larger Ne and higher relative emigration rates. In species with continuous ranges, this phenomenon may limit the ability of peripheral populations to respond to divergent selection. Here, we employ Sitka spruce as a model to test these predictions. We previously genotyped 339 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 410 individuals from 13 populations, and used these data to identify putative targets of divergent selection, as well as to explore the extent to which central-peripheral structure may impede adaptation. Fourteen SNPs had outlier FST estimates suggestive of divergent selection, of which nine were previously associated with phenotypic variation in adaptive traits (timing of autumn budset and cold hardiness). Using coalescent simulations, we show that populations from near the centre of the range have higher effective populations sizes than those from the edges, and that central populations contribute more migrants to marginal populations than the reverse. Our results suggest that while divergent selection appears to have shaped allele frequencies among populations, asymmetrical movement of alleles from the centre to the edges of the species range may affect the adaptive capacity of peripheral populations. In southern peripheral populations, the movement of cold-adapted alleles from the north represents a significant impediment to adaptation under climate change, while in the north, movement of warm-adapted alleles from the south may enhance adaptation. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Water is a key resource, and the plant water transport system sets limits on maximum growth and drought tolerance. When plants open their stomata to achieve a high stomatal conductance (gs) to capture CO2 for photosynthesis, water is lost by transpiration(1,2). Water evaporating from the airspaces is replaced from cell walls, in turn drawing water from the xylem of leaf veins, in turn drawing from xylem in the stems and roots. As water is pulled through the system, it experiences hydraulic resistance, creating tension throughout the system and a low leaf water potential (Ψ(leaf)). The leaf itself is a critical bottleneck in the whole plant system, accounting for on average 30% of the plant hydraulic resistance(3). Leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf) = 1/ leaf hydraulic resistance) is the ratio of the water flow rate to the water potential gradient across the leaf, and summarizes the behavior of a complex system: water moves through the petiole and through several orders of veins, exits into the bundle sheath and passes through or around mesophyll cells before evaporating into the airspace and being transpired from the stomata. K(leaf) is of strong interest as an important physiological trait to compare species, quantifying the effectiveness of the leaf structure and physiology for water transport, and a key variable to investigate for its relationship to variation in structure (e.g., in leaf venation architecture) and its impacts on photosynthetic gas exchange. Further, K(leaf) responds strongly to the internal and external leaf environment(3). K(leaf) can increase dramatically with irradiance apparently due to changes in the expression and activation of aquaporins, the proteins involved in water transport through membranes(4), and K(leaf) declines strongly during drought, due to cavitation and/or collapse of xylem conduits, and/or loss of permeability in the extra-xylem tissues due to mesophyll and bundle sheath cell shrinkage or aquaporin deactivation(5-10). Because K(leaf) can constrain gs and photosynthetic rate across species in well watered conditions and during drought, and thus limit whole-plant performance they may possibly determine species distributions especially as droughts increase in frequency and severity(11-14). We present a simple method for simultaneous determination of K(leaf) and gs on excised leaves. A transpiring leaf is connected by its petiole to tubing running to a water source on a balance. The loss of water from the balance is recorded to calculate the flow rate through the leaf. When steady state transpiration (E, mmol • m(-2) • s(-1)) is reached, gs is determined by dividing by vapor pressure deficit, and K(leaf) by dividing by the water potential driving force determined using a pressure chamber (K(leaf)= E /- Δψ(leaf), MPa)(15). This method can be used to assess K(leaf) responses to different irradiances and the vulnerability of K(leaf) to dehydration(14,16,17).},

Diversification of Acropora was thought to have occurred in the central Indo-Pacific within the previous two million years. We examined Eocene fossils from southern England and northern France and found evidence that precursors of up to nine of 20 currently recognized Acropora species groups existed 49-34 Myr, at palaeolatitudes far higher than current limits, to 518°N.

Symptoms of reed decline recently observed in the Italian Peninsula provided the starting point for a detailed investigation on a reed population in one of the largest freshwater ecosystems in Central Italy. The analyses were conducted over two vegetative seasons in 19 plots at seven locations. A set of 13 morphologic and phenologic reed traits were screened, monitored and statistically analysed. The data indicated the presence of the reed die-back syndrome in a wet Mediterranean ecosystem and enabled us to highlight a set of usable traits to detect the condition of decline. Among them, the stem height and diameter, the number of nodes, the relative growth rate and the lateral root diameter resulted the most significant factors highlighting the declining condition. Some environmental characteristics of the reed stands were also taken into account. The period of submersion and the presence of standing litter emerged as important features of the stands, strictly related to the degree of decline in the population. The results draw attention to the risk, in southern Europe too, of the loss of an ecosystem which plays an important role in biodiversity conservation. © 2011 Académie des sciences.},

	abstract = {The exploitation of rare and endangered species can end in the species's extinction because the increased value people associate with rarity increases the economic incentive to exploit the last individuals, creating a positive feedback loop. This recently proposed concept, called the anthropogenic Allee effect (AAE), relies on the assumption that people do value rarity, but this remains to be established. Moreover, it also remains to be determined whether attraction to rarity is a trait confined to a minority of hobbyists (e.g. wildlife collectors, exotic pet owners) or characteristic of the general public. We estimated how much the general public valued rare species compared with common ones, using five different metrics related to personal investment: time spent, physical effort, unpleasantness, economic investment and risk. We surveyed the visitors of a zoo. To see the rare species, the visitors to the zoo invested more time in searching and contemplation, they were ready to expend more physical effort, they tolerated more unpleasant conditions, they were willing to pay more and, finally, they risked more to obtain (steal) a rare species. Our results provide substantial evidence of how the general public places more value on rare species, compared with common species. This confirms the AAE as an actual process, which in addition concerns a large part of the population. This has important consequences for the conservation of species that are rare now, or that could become so in the future. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic determinants of bacterial growth, death, and spread within mammalian hosts cannot be fully resolved studying a single bacterial population. They are also currently poorly understood. Here, we report on the application of sophisticated experimental approaches to map spatiotemporal population dynamics of bacteria during an infection. We analyzed heterogeneous traits of simultaneous infections with tagged Salmonella enterica populations (wild-type isogenic tagged strains [WITS]) in wild-type and gene-targeted mice. WITS are phenotypically identical but can be distinguished and enumerated by quantitative PCR, making it possible, using probabilistic models, to estimate bacterial death rate based on the disappearance of strains through time. This multidisciplinary approach allowed us to establish the timing, relative occurrence, and immune control of key infection parameters in a true host-pathogen combination. Our analyses support a model in which shortly after infection, concomitant death and rapid bacterial replication lead to the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs, a process controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased microbial mortality leads to an exponential increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally, with subsequent mixing of bacteria between organs via bacteraemia and further stochastic selection. This approach provides us with an unprecedented outlook on the pathogenesis of S. enterica infections, illustrating the complex spatial and stochastic effects that drive an infectious disease. The application of the novel method that we present in appropriate and diverse host-pathogen combinations, together with modelling of the data that result, will facilitate a comprehensive view of the spatial and stochastic nature of within-host dynamics. © 2008 Grant et al.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty is a problem not only in human decision-making, but is a prevalent quality of natural environments and thus requires evolutionary response. Unpredictable natural selection is expected to result in the evolution of bet-hedging strategies, which are adaptations to long-term fluctuating selection. Despite a recent surge of interest in bet hedging, its study remains mired in conceptual and practical difficulties, compounded by confusion over what constitutes evidence for its existence. Here, I attempt to resolve misunderstandings about bet hedging and its relationship with other modes of response to environmental change, identify the challenges inherent to its study and assess the state of existing empirical evidence. The variety and distribution of plausible bet-hedging traits found across 16 phyla in over 100 studies suggest their ubiquity. Thus, bet hedging should be considered a specific mode of response to environmental change. However, the distribution of bet-hedging studies across evidence categories- defined according to potential strength-is heavily skewed towards weaker categories, underscoring the need for direct appraisals of the adaptive significance of putative bet-hedging traits in nature. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary biologists increasingly recognize that evolution can be constrained by trade-offs, yet our understanding of how and when such constraints are manifested and whether they restrict adaptive divergence in populations remains limited.Here, we show that spatial heterogeneity in moisture maintains a polymorphism for pungency (heat) among natural populations of wild chilies (Capsicum chacoense) because traits influencing water-use efficiency are functionally integrated with traits controlling pungency (the production of capsaicinoids). Pungent and non-pungent chilies occur along a cline in moisture that spans their native range in Bolivia, and the proportion of pungent plants in populations increases with greater moisture availability. In high moisture environments, pungency is beneficial because capsaicinoids protect the fruit from pathogenic fungi, and is not costly because pungent and non-pungent chilies grown in well-watered conditions produce equal numbers of seeds. In low moisture environments, pungency is less beneficial as the risk of fungal infection is lower, and carries a significant cost because, under drought stress, seed production in pungent chilies is reduced by 50 per cent relative to non-pungent plants grown in identical conditions. This large difference in seed production under water-stressed (WS) conditions explains the existence of populations dominated by non-pungent plants, and appears to result from a genetic correlation between pungency and stomatal density: non-pungent plants, segregating from intra-population crosses, exhibit significantly lower stomatal density (p = 0.003), thereby reducing gas exchange underWSconditions. These results demonstrate the importance of trait integration in constraining adaptive divergence among populations. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

Suction takes place after mechanical triggering and is owing to a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body accompanied by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight. The exceptional trapping speed-far above human visual perception-impeded profound investigations until now. Using high-speed video imaging and special microscopy techniques, we obtained fully time-resolved recordings of the door movement. We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known. Fluid acceleration reaches very high values, leaving little chance for prey animals to escape. We discovered that the door deformation is morphologically predetermined, and actually performs a buckling/unbuckling process, including a complete trapdoor curvature inversion. This process, which we predict using dynamical simulations and simple theoretical models, is highly reproducible: the traps are autonomously repetitive as they fire spontaneously after 5-20 h and reset actively to their ready-to-catch condition. ©2011 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms behind the spatial patterns of species distributions is one of the major focuses in theoretical ecology. Spatial modelling techniques such as lattice models and cellular automata bring numerous spatial patterns in ecology. Taking spatial factors into account also helps to solve many puzzles in ecology, such as the paradoxes of diversity, polymorphism and altruism. To analyze the numerous spatial patterns, ecologists introduced the moment approximation from statistical physics. Spatial analysis of species distributions can also finds its roots in the sampling statistics of ecology. Based on aggregation indicators (e.g. Lloyd's indices and joint-count statistics), ecologists are able to distinguish the degree of non-randomness from spatially implicit and explicit perspectives, with over-dispersal and spatial autocorrelation as the synonyms of aggregation, respectively. Such sampling statistics also leads to the occupancy-abundance relationship with valuable applications in conservation. Although both spatial modelling and spatial analysis aim to achieve a profound understanding of species spatial patterns, they barely intersect. Through building the connections between sampling statistics and moment (pair) approximation, we unveil the relationship between the sampling density (mean abundance) and the colonizationextinction process. The intersection also solves the scaling pattern of species distribution by applying the pair approximation and the Bayesian rule into the joint-count statistics. By a scaling metapopulation model, we found that randomness is the bridge linking sampling statistics and spatial modelling, as well as the spatially implicit and explicit patterns. This intersection also sheds light on the occupancy-abundance relationship and the connection between spatial patterns and species life-history traits. In this exercise, we emphasize the importance and potential of bringing these two schools of knowledge together in understanding ecological complexity. Ten merging questions that require this intersection have been presented to expound on possible applications to the species distribution and the community structure in the near future. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The first player takes two alternative options with probability x and 1-x; and the second player takes options with probability y and 1-y. Due to natural selection and recurrent mutation, the population evolves to have broad distributions of x and y. We analyze three cases showing qualitatively different dynamics, exemplified by (1) vigilance-intrusion game, (2) asymmetric hawk-dove game and (3) cleaner-client game. We found that the evolutionary outcome is strongly dependent upon the distribution of mutants' traits, more than the mutation rates. For example in the vigilance-intrusion game, the evolutionary dynamics show a perpetual stable oscillation if mutants are always close to the parent (local-mutation mode), whilst the population converges to a stable equilibrium distribution if mutants can be quite different from the parent (global-mutation mode), even for extremely low mutation rate. When common local mutations and rare global mutations occur simultaneously, the evolutionary outcome is controlled by the latter. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Natural populations increasingly experience reductions in habitat and population size concurrent with increasing novel environmental variation owing to anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Recent studies show that a species risk of decline towards extinction is often non-random across species with different life histories. We propose that species with life histories in which all stage-specific vital rates are more evenly important to population growth rate may be less likely to decline towards extinction under these pressures. To test our prediction, we modelled declines in population growth rates under simulated stochastic disturbance to the vital rates of 105 species taken from the literature. Populations with more equally important vital rates, determined using elasticity analysis, declined more slowly across a gradient of increasing simulated environmental variation. Furthermore, higher evenness of elasticity was significantly correlated with a reduced chance of listing as Threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. The relative importance of life-history traits of diverse species can help us infer how natural assemblages will be affected by novel anthropogenic and climatic disturbances. © 2012 The Royal Society},

	abstract = {Natural populations worldwide are increasingly fragmented by habitat loss. Isolation at small population size is thought to reduce individual and population fitness via inbreeding depression. However, little is known about the time-scale over which adverse genetic effects may develop in natural populations or the number and types of traits likely to be affected. The benefits of restoring gene flow to isolates are therefore also largely unknown. In contrast, the potential costs of migration (e.g. disease spread) are readily apparent. Management for ecological connectivity has therefore been controversial and sometimes avoided. Using pedigree and life-history data collected during 25 years of study, we evaluated genetic decline and rescue in a population of bighorn sheep founded by 12 individuals in 1922 and isolated at an average size of 42 animals for 10-12 generations. Immigration was restored experimentally, beginning in 1985. We detected marked improvements in reproduction, survival and five fitness-related traits among descendants of the 15 recent migrants. Trait values were increased by 23-257% in maximally outbred individuals. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of increased male and female fitness attributable to outbreeding realized in a fully competitive natural setting. Our findings suggest that genetic principles deserve broader recognition as practical management tools with near-term consequences for large-mammal conservation. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

Most models predicting biological responses to environmental change assume that species' climatic envelopes are homogeneous both in space and time. Although recent discussions have questioned this assumption, few empirical studies have characterized intraspecific patterns of genetic variation in traits directly related to environmental tolerance limits. We test the extent of such variation in the broadly distributed tidepool copepod Tigriopus californicus using laboratory rearing and selection experiments to quantify thermal tolerance and scope for adaptation in eight populations spanning more than 178 of latitude. Tigriopus californicus exhibit striking local adaptation to temperature, with less than 1 per cent of the total quantitative variance for thermal tolerance partitioned within populations. Moreover, heat-tolerant phenotypes observed in low-latitude populations cannot be achieved in highlatitude populations, either through acclimation or 10 generations of strong selection. Finally, in four populations there was no increase in thermal tolerance between generations 5 and 10 of selection, suggesting that standing variation had already been depleted. Thus, plasticity and adaptation appear to have limited capacity to buffer these isolated populations against further increases in temperature. Our results suggest that models assuming a uniform climatic envelope may greatly underestimate extinction risk in species with strong local adaptation. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Supergenes are clusters of tightly linked loci maintained in specific allelic combinations to facilitate co-segregation of genes governing adaptive phenotypes. In species where strong selection potentially operates at different levels (e.g. eusocial Hymenoptera), positive selection acting within a population to maintain specific allelic combinations in supergenes may have unexpected consequences for some individuals, including the preservation of disadvantageous traits. The nuclear gene Gp-9 in the invasive fire ant Solenopsis invicta is part of a non-recombining, polymorphic supergene region associated with polymorphism in social organization as well as traits affecting physiology, fecundity and behaviour. We show that both male reproductive success and facultative polyandry in queens have a simple genetic basis and are dependent on male Gp-9 genotype. Gp-9b males are unable to maintain exclusive reproductive control over their mates such that queens mated to Gp-9b males remain highly receptive to remating. Queens mated to multiple Gp-9B males are rare. This difference appears to be independent of mating plug production in fertile males of each Gp-9 genotype. However, Gp-9b males have significantly lower sperm counts than Gp-9B males, which could be a cue to females to seek additional mates. Despite the reduced fitness of Gp-9b males, polygyne worker-induced selective mortality of sexuals lacking b-like alleles coupled with the overall success of the polygyne social form act to maintain the Gp-9b allele within nature. Our findings highlight how strong worker-induced selection acting to maintain the Gp-9b allele in the polygyne social form may simultaneously result in reduced reproductive fitness for individual sexual offspring. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {The pivotal question in the debate on the ecological effects of climate change is whether species will be able to adapt fast enough to keep up with their changing environment. If we establish the maximal rate of adaptation, this will set an upper limit to the rate at which temperatures can increase without loss of biodiversity.The rate of adaptation will primarily be set by the rate of microevolution since (i) phenotypic plasticity alone is not sufficient as reaction norms will no longer be adaptive and hence microevolution on the reaction norm is needed, (ii) learning will be favourable to the individual but cannot be passed on to the next generations, (iii) maternal effects may play a role but, as with other forms of phenotypic plasticity, the response of offspring to the maternal cues will no longer be adaptive in a changing environment, and (iv) adaptation via immigration of individuals with genotypes adapted to warmer environments also involves microevolution as these genotypes are better adapted in terms of temperature, but not in terms of, for instance, photoperiod.Long-term studies on wild populations with individually known animals play an essential role in detecting and understanding the temporal trends in life-history traits, and to estimate the heritability of, and selection pressures on, life-history traits. However, additional measurements on other trophic levels and on the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are needed to predict the rate of microevolution, especially under changing conditions.Using this knowledge on heritability of, and selection on, life-history traits, in combination with climate scenarios, we will be able to predict the rate of adaptation for different climate scenarios. The final step is to use ecoevolutionary dynamical models to make the link to population viability and from there to biodiversity loss for those scenarios where the rate of adaptation is insufficient. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

In infinite populations, the invasion fitness of a mutant in this two-allele representation of the evolutionary process is used to characterize features about long-term phenotypic evolution, such as singular points, convergence stability (established from first-order effects of selection), branching points, and evolutionary stability (established from second-order effects of selection). Here, we try to characterize long-term phenotypic evolution in finite populations from this two-allele representation of the evolutionary process. We construct a stochastic model describing evolutionary dynamics at non-rare mutant allele frequency. We then derive stability conditions based on stationary average mutant frequencies in the presence of vanishing mutation rates. We find that the second-order stability condition obtained from second-order effects of selection is identical to convergence stability. Thus, in two-allele systems in finite populations, convergence stability is enough to characterize long-term evolution under the trait substitution sequence assumption. We perform individual-based simulations to confirm our analytic results. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Quantile regressions were used to analyse the changes in spring and autumn migration phenology. Median spring arrival date of Sedge and Reed Warblers shifted 6.5 and 7.5 days earlier, respectively. Autumn arrival of all species shifted one (Reed and Marsh Warblers) or two (Sedge Warbler) weeks later. Mean body mass of adult Reed and Marsh Warblers decreased in spring (by 0.3 and 0.2 grams, respectively) and in autumn (by 0.8 and 0.2 grams, respectively) while body mass of adult Sedge Warblers decreased only in autumn (by 0.4 grams). Mean wing length of all species increased significantly (range of change: 0.6-1 mm). Despite the fact that the studied species are closely related, all three have remarkably different migration strategies. However, similar patterns can be observed in the studied parameters, indicating that global processes may have general effects on these species, albeit through markedly different mechanisms. © 2011 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	abstract = {It has recently been demonstrated that ecological feedback mechanisms can facilitate the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in public goods interactions: the replicator dynamics of defectors and cooperators can result, for example, in the ecological coexistence of cooperators and defectors. Here we show that these results change dramatically if cooperation strategy is not fixed but instead is a continuously varying trait under natural selection. For low values of the factor with which the value of resources is multiplied before they are shared among all participants, evolution will always favour lower cooperation strategies until the population falls below an Allee threshold and goes extinct, thus evolutionary suicide occurs. For higher values of the factor, there exists a unique evolutionarily singular strategy, which is convergence stable. Because the fitness function is linear with respect to the strategy of the mutant, this singular strategy is neutral against mutant invasions. This neutrality disappears if a nonlinear functional response in receiving benefits is assumed. For strictly concave functional responses, singular strategies become uninvadable. Evolutionary branching, which could result in the evolutionary emergence of cooperators and defectors, can occur only with locally convex functional responses, but we illustrate that it can also result in coevolutionary extinction. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Sib matings increase homozygosity and, hence, the frequency of detrimental phenotypes caused by recessive deleterious alleles. However, many species have evolved adaptations that prevent the genetic costs associated with inbreeding. We discovered that the highly invasive longhorn crazy ant, Paratrechina longicornis, has evolved an unusual mode of reproduction whereby sib mating does not result in inbreeding. A population genetic study of P. longicornis revealed dramatic differences in allele frequencies between queens, males and workers. Mother-offspring analyses demonstrated that these allele frequency differences resulted from the fact that the three castes were all produced through different means. Workers developed through normal sexual reproduction between queens and males. However, queens were produced clonally and, thus, were genetically identical to their mothers. In contrast, males never inherited maternal alleles and were genetically identical to their fathers. The outcome of this system is that genetic inbreeding is impossible because queen and male genomes remain completely separate. Moreover, the sexually produced worker offspring retain the same genotype, combining alleles from both the maternal and paternal lineage over generations. Thus, queens may mate with their brothers in the parental nest, yet their offspring are no more homozygous than if the queen mated with a male randomly chosen from the population. The complete segregation of the male and female gene pools allows the queens to circumvent the costs associated with inbreeding and therefore may act as an important pre-adaptation for the crazy ant's tremendous invasive success. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

One might expect that over evolutionary time scales internal random processes found in living systems display characteristics that maximize fitness. Here we focus on animal random search strategies [G.M. Viswanathan, S.V. Buldyrev, S. Havlin, M.G.E. Da Luz, E.P. Raposo, H.E.

Lett. 88 (2002) 097901 and 89 (2002) 109902], and we describe experiments with the following Daphnia species: D. magna, D. galeata, D. lumholtzi, D. pulicaria, and D. pulex. We observe that the animals, while foraging for food, choose turning angles from distributions that can be described by exponential functions with a range of widths. This observation leads us to speculate and test the notion that this characteristic distribution of turning angles evolved in order to enhance survival. In the case of theoretical agents, some form of randomness is often introduced into search algorithms, especially when information regarding the sought object(s) is incomplete or even misleading. In the case of living animals, many studies have focused on search strategies that involve randomness [H.C. Berg, Random Walks in Biology, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey, 1993; A. Okubo, S.A. Levin (Eds.), Diffusion and Ecological Problems: Modern Perspectives, second ed., Springer, New York, 2001]. A simple theory based on stochastic differential equations of the motion backed up by a simulation shows that the collection of material (information, energy, food, supplies, etc.) by an agent executing Brownian-type hopping motions is optimized while foraging for a finite time in a supply patch of limited spatial size if the agent chooses turning angles taken from an exponential distribution with a specific stochastic intensity or 'noise width'. Search strategies that lead to optimization is a topic of high current interest across many disciplines [D. Wolpert, W. MacReady, No free lunch theorems for optimization, IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation 1 (1997) 67]. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Selection for enhanced cognitive traits is hypothesized to produce enhancements to brain structures that support those traits. Although numerous studies suggest that this pattern is robust, there are several mechanisms that may produce this association. First, cognitive traits and their neural underpinnings may be fixed as a result of differential selection on cognitive function within specific environments. Second, these relationships may be the product of the selection for plasticity, where differences are produced owing to an individual's experiences in the environment. Alternatively, the relationship may be a complex function of experience, genetics and/or epigenetic effects. Using a well-studied model species (black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapillus), we have for the first time, to our knowledge, addressed these hypotheses. We found that differences in hippocampal (Hp) neuron number, neurogenesis and spatial memory previously observed in wild chickadees persisted in hand-raised birds from the same populations, even when birds were raised in an identical environment. These findings reject the hypothesis that variation in these traits is owing solely to differences in memory-based experiences in different environments. Moreover, neuron number and neurogenesis were strikingly similar between captiveraised and wild birds from the same populations, further supporting the genetic hypothesis. Hp volume, however, did not differ between the captive-raised populations, yet was very different in their wild counterparts, supporting the experience hypothesis. Our results indicate that the production of some Hp factors may be inherited and largely independent of environmental experiences in adult life, regardless of their magnitude, in animals under high selection pressure for memory, while traits such as volume may be more plastic and modified by the environment. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

Analytical and numerical findings show that (1) perfectly synchronous intermittent reproduction does not evolve; (2) if the fruiting cost of female flowers Rc is sufficiently large and the pollen limitation Β is intermediate, annual reproduction does not evolve; (3) under conditions (2), sex ratio dimorphism can evolve across a wide region of parameter space; (4) after dimorphism is established, individuals with a female-biased sex ratio receive much more pollen supply from male-biased individuals and tend to show intermittent reproduction with or without synchrony; and (5) dimorphism is maintained with irregular and nearly discontinuous changes of sex ratio. These results suggest that sex ratio dimorphism contributes to improving pollen availability and causes resource depletion and the occurrence of intermittent reproduction in female-biased individuals. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Changing land use and the spread of 'winning' native or exotic plants are expected to lead to biotic homogenization (BH), in which previously distinct plant communities become progressively more similar. In parallel, many ecosystems have recently seen increases in local species (α-) diversity, yet γ-diversity has continued to decline at larger scales. Using national ecological surveillance data for Great Britain, we quantify relationships between change in α-diversity and between-habitat homogenizations at two levels of organization: species composition and plant functional traits. Across Britain both increases and decreases in α-diversity were observed in small random sampling plots (10-200 m2) located within a national random sample of 1 km square regions. As α-diversity declined (spatially in 1978 or temporally between 1978 and 1998), plant communities became functionally more similar, but species-compositional similarity declined. Thus, different communities converged on a narrower range of winning trait syndromes, but species identities remained historically contingent, differentiating a mosaic of residual species-poor habitat patches within each 1 km square. The reverse trends in β-diversity occurred where α-diversity increased. When impacted by the same type and intensity of environmental change, directions of change in α-diversity are likely to depend upon differences in starting productivity and disturbance. This is one reason why local diversity change and BH across habitats are not likely to be consistently coupled. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

A number of studies have addressed this pattern across higher taxa (e.g. 'beetles'), but we know much less about the generality and causal basis of the variation in diversity within evolutionary radiations at lower taxonomic scales. Here, we address the causes of variation in species richness among major lineages of Australia's most diverse vertebrate radiation, a clade of at least 232 species of scincid lizards. We use new mitochondrial and nuclear intron DNA sequences to test the extent of diversification rate variation in this group. We present an improved likelihood-based method for estimating per-lineage diversification rates from combined phylogenetic and taxonomic (species richness) data, and use the method in a hypothesis-testing framework to localize diversification rate shifts on phylogenetic trees. We soundly reject homogeneity of diversification rates among members of this radiation, and find evidence for a dramatic rate increase in the common ancestor of the genera Ctenotus and Lerista. Our results suggest that the evolution of traits associated with climate tolerance may have had a role in shaping patterns of diversity in this group. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

The number of descendants found at the release sites the subsequent year increased with increasing number of colour morphs in the founder group, and variation in founder groups also positively affected colour morph diversity in the established populations. Since colour morphs differ in morphology, physiology, behaviour, reproductive life history and types of niche used, these findings demonstrate that variation among individuals in functionally important traits promotes establishment success under natural conditions, and further indicate that founder diversity may contribute to evolutionary rescue and increased population persistence. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on how food web structure and interactions among species affects the vulnerability, due to environmental variability, to extinction of species at different positions in model food webs. Vulnerability is here not measured by a traditional extinction threshold but is instead inspired by the IUCN criteria for endangered species: an observed rapid decline in population abundance. Using model webs influenced by stochasticity with zero autocorrelation, we investigate the ecological determinants of species vulnerability, i.e. the trophic interactions between species and food web structure and how these interact with the risk of sudden drops in abundance of species. We find that (i) producers fulfil the criterion of vulnerable species more frequently than other species, (ii) food web structure is related to vulnerability, and (iii) the vulnerability of species is greater when involved in a strong trophic interaction than when not. We note that our result on the relationship between extinction risk and trophic position of species contradict previous suggestions and argue that the main reason for the discrepancy probably is due to the fact that we study the vulnerability to environmental stochasticity and not extinction risk due to overexploitation, habitat destruction or interactions with introduced species. Thus, we suggest that the vulnerability of species to environmental stochasticity may be differently related to trophic position than the vulnerability of species to other factors. Earlier research on species extinctions has looked for intrinsic traits of species that correlate with increased vulnerability to extinction. However, to fully understand the extinction process we must also consider that species interactions may affect vulnerability and that not all extinctions are the result of long, gradual reductions in species abundances. Under environmental stochasticity (which importance frequently is assumed to increase as a result of climate change) and direct and indirect interactions with other species some extinctions may occur rapidly and apparently unexpectedly. To identify the first declines of population abundances that may escalate and lead to extinctions as early as possible, we need to recognize which species are at greatest risk of entering such dangerous routes and under what circumstances. This new perspective may contribute to our understanding of the processes leading to extinction of populations and eventually species. This is especially urgent in the light of the current biodiversity crisis where a large fraction of the world's biodiversity is threatened. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {How organisms may adapt to rising global temperatures is uncertain, but concepts can emerge from studying adaptive physiological trait variations across existing spatial climate gradients. Many ectotherms, particularly fish, have evolved increasing genetic growth capacities with latitude (i.e. countergradient variation (CnGV) in growth), which are thought to be an adaptation primarily to strong gradients in seasonality. In contrast, evolutionary responses to gradients in mean temperature are often assumed to involve an alternative mode, 'thermal adaptation'. We measured thermal growth reaction norms in Pacific silverside populations (Atherinops affinis) occurring across a weak latitudinal temperature gradient with invariant seasonality along the North American Pacific coast. Instead of thermal adaptation, we found novel evidence for CnGV in growth, suggesting that CnGV is a ubiquitous mode of reaction-norm evolution in ectotherms even in response to weak spatial and, by inference, temporal climate gradients. A novel, largescale comparison between ecologically equivalent Pacific versus Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) revealed how closely growth CnGV patterns reflect their respective climate gradients. While steep growth reaction norms and increasing growth plasticity with latitude in M. menidia mimicked the strong, highly seasonal Atlantic coastal gradient, shallow reaction norms and much smaller, latitude-independent growth plasticity in A. affinis resembled the weak Pacific latitudinal temperature gradient. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

The functional determinations of all genes that participate in drought adaptation or tolerance reactions are expected to provide an integrated understanding of the biochemical and physiological basis of stress responses in wheat. However, despite all the recent technological breakthroughs, the overall contribution of genomics-assisted breeding to the release of drought-resilient wheat cultivars has so far been marginal. This paper critically analyses how biotechnological, genetic and information tools can contribute to accelerating the release of improved, drought-tolerant wheat cultivars.

	abstract = {Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in haematological malignancy patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients(1). Detection of IPA represents a formidable diagnostic challenge and, in the absence of a 'gold standard', relies on a combination of clinical data and microbiology and histopathology where feasible. Diagnosis of IPA must conform to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycology Study Group (EORTC/MSG) consensus defining "proven", "probable", and "possible" invasive fungal diseases(2). Currently, no nucleic acid-based tests have been externally validated for IPA detection and so polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not included in current EORTC/MSG diagnostic criteria. Identification of Aspergillus in histological sections is problematic because of similarities in hyphal morphologies with other invasive fungal pathogens(3), and proven identification requires isolation of the etiologic agent in pure culture. Culture-based approaches rely on the availability of biopsy samples, but these are not always accessible in sick patients, and do not always yield viable propagules for culture when obtained. An important feature in the pathogenesis of Aspergillus is angio-invasion, a trait that provides opportunities to track the fungus immunologically using tests that detect characteristic antigenic signatures molecules in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. This has led to the development of the Platelia enzyme immunoassay (GM-EIA) that detects Aspergillus galactomannan and a 'pan-fungal' assay (Fungitell test) that detects the conserved fungal cell wall component (1 →3)-β-D-glucan, but not in the mucorales that lack this component in their cell walls(1,4). Issues surrounding the accuracy of these tests(1,4-6) has led to the recent development of next-generation monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based assays that detect surrogate markers of infection(1,5). Thornton(5) recently described the generation of an Aspergillus-specific MAb (JF5) using hybridoma technology and its use to develop an immuno-chromatographic lateral-flow device (LFD) for the point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of IPA. A major advantage of the LFD is its ability to detect activity since MAb JF5 binds to an extracellular glycoprotein antigen that is secreted during active growth of the fungus only(5). This is an important consideration when using fluids such as lung BAL for diagnosing IPA since Aspergillus spores are a common component of inhaled air. The utility of the device in diagnosing IPA has been demonstrated using an animal model of infection, where the LFD displayed improved sensitivity and specificity compared to the Platelia GM and Fungitell (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan assays(7). Here, we present a simple LFD procedure to detect Aspergillus antigen in human serum and BAL fluids. Its speed and accuracy provides a novel adjunct point-of-care test for diagnosis of IPA in haematological malignancy patients.},

Using a model of perennial plants in a spatiotemporally fluctuating environment, we find that fluctuating environments may be more or less invasible than static environments. Invasibility is strongly dependent on the interaction of the difference in turnover rates of resident and invader populations and the rate of temporal change of the environment. If resident population turnover is faster than the invader's, then invasibility is an initially positive, decreasing function of the period temporal variation, such that invasibility is increased by rapid temporal fluctuations but slightly reduced in slowly fluctuating environments. If resident turnover is slower than the invader's, then invasibility is an initially negative, increasing function of temporal period, such that invasibility is reduced in rapidly changing environment facilitated by slow temporal fluctuations. These results are explained by the relative abilities of resident and invader populations to successfully respond to environmental variation at different temporal scales. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

Both alone and in combination with other environmental stressors, UV-B is known to have detrimental effects on the early life stages of amphibians, but our understanding of the fitness consequences of these effects remains superficial. We examined the independent and interactive effects of UV-B and predatory chemical cues (PCC) on a suite of traits of Limnodynastes peronii embryos and tadpoles, and assessed tadpole survival time in a predator environment to evaluate the potential fitness consequences. Exposure to a 3 to 6 per cent increase in UV-B, which is comparable to changes in terrestrial UV-B associated with ozone depletion, had no effect on any of the traits measured, except survival time in a predator environment, which was reduced by 22 to 28 per cent. Exposure to PCC caused tadpoles to hatch earlier, have reduced hatching success, have improved locomotor performance and survive for longer in a predator environment, but had no effect on tadpole survival, behaviour or morphology. Simultaneous exposure to UV-B and PCC resulted in no interactive effects. These findings demonstrate that increased UV-B has the potential to reduce tadpole fitness, while exposure to PCCs improves their fitness. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

Recent studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms influencing invasion dynamics is personality-dependent dispersal: The tendency for dispersers to have a different personality type than the average from a source population. We examined this possibility in the invasive mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). We measured individual tendencies to disperse in experimental streams and several personality traits: sociability, boldness, activity and exploration tendency before and three weeks after dispersal. We found that mosquitofish display consistent behavioural tendencies over time, and significant positive correlations between all personality traits. Most notably, sociability was an important indicator of dispersal distance, with more asocial individuals dispersing further, suggesting personality-biased dispersal on an invasion front. These results could have important ecological implications, as invasion by a biased subset of individuals is likely to have different ecological impacts than invasion by a random group of colonists. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

The dynamics of diversity during a radiation reflect an overshooting pattern with an initial phase of exponential-like increase followed by a slower decline. Much attention has been paid to the factors that drive the increase phase, but far less is known about the causes of the decline phase. Decreases in diversity are rarely associated with climatic changes or catastrophic events, suggesting that they may be an intrinsic consequence of diversification. We experimentally identify the factors responsible for losses in diversity during the later stages of the model adaptive radiation of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. Proximately, diversity declines because of the loss of biofilm-forming niche specialist morphotypes. We show that this loss occurs despite the presence of strong divergent selection late in the radiation and is associated with continued adaptation of resident niche specialists to both the biotic and abiotic environments. These results suggest that losses of diversity in the latter stages of an adaptive radiation may be a general consequence of diversification through competition and lends support to the idea that the conditions favouring the emergence of diversity are different from those that ensure its long-term maintenance. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

Where multiple brooding is facultative, its occurrence is likely to change with environmental conditions, and, as a consequence, the current rates of environmental change could have substantial impacts on breeding patterns. Here we examine temporal population-level trends in the proportion of female great tits (Parus major) producing two clutches per year ('double brooding') in four long-term study populations in The Netherlands, and show that the proportion of females that double brood has declined in all populations, with the strongest decline taking place in the last 30 years of the study. For one of the populations, for which we have data on caterpillar abundance, we show that the probability that a female produces a second clutch was related to the timing of her first clutch relative to the peak in caterpillar abundance, and that the probability of double brooding declined over the study period. We further show that the number of recruits from the second clutch decreased significantly over the period 1973-2004 in all populations. Our results indicate that adjustment to changing climatic conditions may involve shifts in life-history traits other than simply the timing of breeding. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

We combined paleogenetic analysis with continent-wide survey of genetic diversity at nuclear and mitochondrial loci to reconstruct the invasion history of a single asexual American water flea clone (hybrid Daphnia pulex X Daphnia pulicaria) in Africa. Within 60 years of the original introduction of this invader, it displaced the genetically diverse, sexual population of native D. pulex in Lake Naivasha (Kenya), despite a formidable numerical advantage of the local population and continuous replenishment from a large dormant egg bank. Currently, the invading clone has spread throughout the range of native African D. pulex, where it appears to be the only occurring genotype. The absence of genetic variation did not hamper either the continent-wide establishment of this exotic lineage or the effective displacement of an indigenous and genetically diverse sibling species. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

We compute the reproductive number of strain i (Ri) independently, as well as the (conditional) "invasion" reproductive number for strains i (Rij, j ≠ i) when strain j is at a positive equilibrium. We show that the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if Ri < 1 for both strains and is unstable if Ri > 1 for one stain. We establish the criterion Rij > 1 for strain i to invade strain j. Subthreshold coexistence driven by coinfection is possible even when Ri of one strain is below 1.

We find that species affected by habitat loss were much more likely to be misclassified as extinct or to remain missing than those affected by introduced predators and diseases, or overkill, unless they had very restricted distributions. We conclude that extinctions owing to habitat loss are most difficult to detect; hence, impacts of habitat loss on extinction have probably been overestimated, especially relative to introduced species. It is most likely that the highest rates of rediscovery will come from searching for species that have gone missing during the 20th century and have relatively large ranges threatened by habitat loss, rather than from additional effort focused on charismatic missing species. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

Infectious diseases caused by pathogenic parasites can have severe impacts on host survival, thereby altering the selection regime and inducing evolutionary responses in their hosts. Knowledge about such evolutionary consequences in natural populations is critical to mitigate potential ecological and economic effects. However, studies on pathogen-induced trait changes are scarce and the pace of evolutionary change is largely unknown, particularly in vertebrates. Here, we use a time series from long-term monitoring of perch to estimate temporal trends in the maturation schedule before and after a severe pathogen outbreak. We show that the disease induced a phenotypic change from a previously increasing to a decreasing size at maturation, the most important life-history transition in animals. Evolutionary rates imposed by the pathogen were high and comparable to those reported for populations exposed to intense human harvesting. Pathogens thus represent highly potent drivers of adaptive phenotypic evolution in vertebrates. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of local adaptation and adaptive potential of natural populations is becoming increasingly relevant due to anthropogenic changes in the environment, such as climate change. The concern is that populations will be negatively affected by increasing temperatures without the capacity to adapt. Temperature-related adaptability in traits related to phenology and early life history are expected to be particularly important in salmonid fishes. We focused on the latter and investigated whether four populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) are locally adapted in early life-history traits. These populations spawn in rivers that experience different temperature conditions during the time of incubation of eggs and embryos. They were reared in a common-garden experiment at three different temperatures. Quantitative genetic differentiation (QST) exceeded neutral molecular differentiation (FST) for two traits, indicating local adaptation. A temperature effect was observed for three traits. However, this effect varied among populations due to locally adapted reaction norms, corresponding to the temperature regimes experienced by the populations in their native environments. Additive genetic variance and heritable variation in phenotypic plasticity suggest that although increasing temperatures are likely to affect some populations negatively, they may have the potential to adapt to changing temperature regimes. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

We analysed range-wide genetic diversity (amplified fragment length polymorphisms) in 9581 samples from 1200 populations of 27 northern plant species, to assess genetic consequences of range reduction and potential association with species traits. We used species distribution modelling (SDM, eight techniques, two global circulation models and two emission scenarios) to predict loss of range and genetic diversity by 2080. Loss of genetic diversity varied considerably among species, and this variation could be explained by dispersal adaptation (up to 57%) and by genetic differentiation among populations (FST; up to 61%). Herbs lacking adaptations for long-distance dispersal were estimated to lose genetic diversity at higher rate than dwarf shrubs adapted to long-distance dispersal. The expected range reduction in these 27 northern species was larger than reported for temperate plants, and all were predicted to lose genetic diversity according to at least one scenario. SDM combined with FST estimates and/or with species trait information thus allows the prediction of species' vulnerability to climate change, aiding rational prioritization of conservation efforts. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

This relationship is still poorly documented for many functionally important taxa, and at larger continental scales. With data from five replicated field studies from three countries, we examined how species richness of wild bees varies with habitat patch size. We hypothesized that the form of this relationship is affected by body size, degree of host plant specialization and sociality. Across all species, we found a positive species-area slope (z = 0.19), and species traits modified this relationship. Large-bodied generalists had a lower z value than small generalists. Contrary to predictions, small specialists had similar or slightly lower z value compared with large specialists, and small generalists also tended to be more strongly affected by habitat loss as compared with small specialists. Social bees were negatively affected by habitat loss (0 = 0.11) irrespective of body size. We conclude that habitat loss leads to clear shifts in the species composition of wild bee communities. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

In organisms where sex is determined by incubation temperature, nesting behaviour may be a prime target of selection in response to unbalanced sex ratios. To produce an evolutionary change in response to sex-ratio selection, components of nesting behaviour must be heritable. We estimated the field heritability of two key components of nesting behaviour in a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with temperature-dependent sex determination by applying the 'animal model' to a pedigree reconstructed from genotype data. We obtained estimates of low to non-detectable heritability using repeated records across all environments. We then determined environment-specific heritability by grouping records with similar temperatures for the winter preceding the nesting season, a variable known to be highly associated with our two traits of interest, nest vegetation cover and Julian date of nesting. The heritability estimates of nest vegetation cover and Julian date of nesting were qualitatively highest and significant, or nearly so, after hot winters. Additive genetic variance for these traits was not detectable after cold winters. Our analysis suggests that the potential for evolutionary change of nesting behaviour may be dependent on the thermal conditions of the preceding winter, a season that is predicted to be especially subject to climate change. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

This study related differences in three functional traits of pollinating bees (flower height preference, daily time of flower visitation and within-flower behaviour) to the seed set of the obligate cross-pollinated pumpkin Cucurbita moschata Duch. ex Poir. across a land-use intensity gradient from tropical rainforest and agroforests to grassland in Indonesia. Bee richness and abundance changed with habitat variables and we used this natural variation to test whether complementary resource use by the diverse pollinator community enhanced final yield. We found that pollinator diversity, but not abundance, was positively related to seed set of pumpkins. Bees showed species-specific spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation traits and within-flower behaviour, allowing for classification into functional guilds. Diversity of functional groups explained even more of the variance in seed set (r2=45%) than did species richness (r2=32%) highlighting the role of functional complementarity. Even though we do not provide experimental, but rather correlative evidence, we can link spatial and temporal complementarity in highly diverse pollinator communities to pollination success in the field, leading to enhanced crop yield without any managed honeybees. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

Consequently, it is poorly understood which factors influence the evolution of parasitism itself. We investigate how ploidy level and the genetic mechanisms underlying infection influence evolution along the continuum of parasitism levels. In order for parasitism to evolve, selective benefits to the successful invasion of hosts must outweigh the losses when encountering resistant hosts. However, we find that exactly where this threshold occurs depends not only on the strength of selection, but also on the genetic model of interaction, the ploidy level in each species, and the nature of the costs to virulence and resistance. With computer simulations, we are able to incorporate more realistic dynamics at the loci underlying species interactions and to extend our analyses in a number of directions, including finite population sizes, multiple alleles and different generation times. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Environmental change is as multifaceted as are the species and communities that respond to these changes. Current theoretical approaches to modeling ecosystem response to environmental change often deal only with single environmental drivers or single species traits, simple ecological interactions, and/or steady states, leading to concern about how accurately these approaches will capture future responses to environmental change in real biological systems. To begin addressing this issue, we generalize a previous trait-based framework to incorporate aspects of frequency dependence, functional complementarity, and the dynamics of systems composed of species that are defined by multiple traits that are tied to multiple environmental drivers. The framework is particularly well suited for analyzing the role of temporal environmental fluctuations in maintaining trait variability and the resultant effects on community response to environmental change. Using this framework, we construct simple models to investigate two ecological problems. First, we show how complementary resource use can significantly enhance the nutrient uptake of plant communities through two different mechanisms related to increased productivity (over-yielding) and larger trait variability. Over-yielding is a hallmark of complementarity and increases the total biomass of the community and, thus, the total rate at which nutrients are consumed. Trait variability also increases due to the lower levels of competition associated with complementarity, thus speeding up the rate at which more efficient species emerge as conditions change. Second, we study systems in which multiple environmental drivers act on species defined by multiple, correlated traits. We show that correlations in these systems can increase trait variability within the community and again lead to faster responses to environmental change. The methodological advances provided here will apply to almost any function that relates species traits and environmental drivers to growth, and should prove useful for studying the effects of climate change on the dynamics of biota. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Eusocial organisms are characterized by cooperative brood care, generation overlap and reproductive division of labour. Traits associated with eusociality are most developed in ants, termites, paper wasps and corbiculate bees; the fossil record indicates that each of these advanced eusocial taxa evolved in the Late Cretaceous or earlier (greater than 65 Myr ago). Halictid bees also include a large and diverse number of eusocial members, but, in contrast to advanced eusocial taxa, they are characterized by substantial intraand inter-specific variation in social behaviour, which may be indicative of more recent eusocial evolution. To test this hypothesis, we used over 2400 bp of DNA sequence data gathered from three protein-coding nuclear genes (opsin, wingless and EF-1a) to infer the phylogeny of eusocial halictid lineages and their relatives. Results from relaxed molecular clock dating techniques that utilize a combination of molecular and fossil data indicate that the three independent origins of eusociality in halictid bees occurred within a narrow time frame between approximately 20 and 22 Myr ago. This relatively recent evolution helps to explain the pronounced levels of social variation observed within these bees. The three origins of eusociality appear to be temporally correlated with a period of global warming, suggesting that climate may have had an important role in the evolution and maintenance of eusociality in these bees. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

Using stochastic modelling techniques in the context of bacteria-virus interactions, we investigate the impact of coevolution across a continuum of host-parasite genetic specificity (specifically, where genotypes have the same infectivity/resistance ranges (matching alleles, MA) to highly variable ranges (gene-for-gene, GFG)) on population genetic structure, and on the social behaviour of the host. We find that host cooperation is more likely to be maintained towards the MA end of the continuum, as the more frequent bottlenecks associated with an MA-like interaction can prevent defector invasion, and can even allow migrant cooperators to invade populations of defectors. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic alteration of biotic distributions and disturbance regimes has dramatically changed the evolutionary context for the differentiation of species traits. Some of the most striking examples in recent centuries have been on islands where flightless birds, which evolved in the absence of mammalian carnivores, have been decimated following the widespread introduction of exotic predators. Until now, no equivalent case has been reported for plants. Here, we make use of robust analytical tools and an exceptionally wellsampled molecular phylogeny to show that a majority of New Zealand danthonioid grasses (Poaceae) may have adapted to the relaxed vertebrate herbivore pressure during the late Cenozoic through the development of a distinctive and unusual habit: abscission of old leaves. This feature occurs in only about 3 percent of the world's roughly 11 000 grass species and has been empirically shown to increase plant productivity but to reduce protection against mammal grazing. This result suggests that release from a selective pressure can lead to species radiations. This seemingly anachronistic adaptation may represent an overlooked factor contributing to the severe decline in the geographical extent and species diversity of New Zealand's indigenous grasslands following the introduction of herbivorous terrestrial mammals in the 19th century.

Species are expected to vary in their capacity to respond to these changes: long-distance migrants and those lacking variability in migratory traits are probably at considerable disadvantage. The few studies that have assessed the degree of plasticity in behaviour of marine animals suggest that fidelity to non-breeding destinations is usually high. In the present study, we evaluated individual flexibility in migration strategy of a highly pelagic seabird, the Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea. Geolocation data from 72 different migrations, including 14 birds that were tracked for more than one non-breeding season, showed a remarkable capacity to change winter destinations between years. Although some birds exhibited high site fidelity, others shifted from the South to North Atlantic, from the western to eastern South Atlantic, and from the Atlantic to Indian Ocean. Individuals also showed flexibility in stopover behaviour and migratory schedule. Although their K-selected lifehistory strategy has the disadvantage that the chances of microevolution are slight if circumstances alter rapidly, these results suggest that Cory's shearwaters may be in a better position than many other long-distance migrants to face the consequences of a changing environment. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

In the case of the tropical water flea Daphnia lumholtzi, which invaded North America, it has been suggested that this species possesses a high thermal tolerance, which in the course of global climate change promotes its establishment and rapid spread. However, D. lumholtzi has an additional remarkable feature: it is the only water flea that forms rigid head spines in response to chemicals released in the presence of fishes. These morphologically (phenotypically) plastic traits serve as an inducible defence against these predators. Here, we show in controlled mesocosm experiments that the native North American species Daphnia pulicaria is competitively superior to D. lumholtzi in the absence of predators. However, in the presence of fish predation the invasive species formed its defences and became dominant. This observation of a predator-mediated switch in dominance suggests that the inducible defence against fish predation may represent a key adaptation for the invasion success of D. lumholtzi. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

Here, we assess relationships among PD, SR and TD for a number of traits both across clades and regional assemblages of mammals. We also contrast results using two different measures of TD, trait variance and a new measure we refer to as trait bin filling (the number of orders of magnitude of variation that contain at least one species). When TD is defined as trait variance, PD is a much stronger correlate of TD than SR across clades, consistent with hypotheses about the conservation value of PD. However, when TD is defined as bin filling, PD and SR show similar correlations with TD across clades and space. We also investigate potential losses of SR, PD and TD if species that are currently threatened were to go extinct, and find that threatened PD is often a similar predictor of threatened TD as SR. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {How ecological opportunity relates to diversification is a central question in evolutionary biology. However, there are few empirical examples of how ecological opportunity and morphological innovation open new adaptive zones, and promote diversification. We analyse data on diet, skull morphology and bite performance, and relate these traits to diversification rates throughout the evolutionary history of an ecologically diverse family of mammals (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). We found a significant increase in diversification rate driven by increased speciation at the most recent common ancestor of the predominantly frugivorous subfamily Stenodermatinae. The evolution of diet was associated with skull morphology, and morphology was tightly coupled with biting performance, linking phenotype to new niches through performance. Following the increase in speciation rate, the rate of morphological evolution slowed, while the rate of evolution in diet increased. This pattern suggests that morphology stabilized, and niches within the new adaptive zone of frugivory were filled rapidly, after the evolution of a new cranial phenotype that resulted in a certain level of mechanical efficiency. The tree-wide speciation rate increased non linearly with a more frugivorous diet, and was highest at measures of skull morphology associated with morphological extremes, including the most derived Stenodermatines. These results show that a novel stenodermatine skull phenotype played a central role in the evolution of frugivory and increasing speciation within phyllostomids. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

Most of these chronic microbial infections are not deleterious to the eukaryotic host, and some are beneficial or even required by the host. Many microorganisms expand the metabolic repertoire of the host through such metabolic capabilities as photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, and so on, but some beneficial effects of microbial infections cannot be attributed to specific microbial traits (e.g., enhanced drought tolerance of mycorrhizal plants). Most vertically transmitted microorganisms are beneficial for their host, but several taxa, notably Wolbachia, are reproductive parasites that promote their own transmission through the maternal line by, for example, feminizing genetic male hosts or inducing parthenogenesis. Chemical signaling between host and symbionts plays a crucial role in the establishment of associations with horizontally transmitted microorganisms. Most intracellular microorganisms gain entry into the host cells by phagocytosis; some persist in the resultant vacuole, which may be modified to prevent lysosomal fusion, while others escape from the host membrane to lie free in the host cell cytoplasm. Microbial populations are regulated by controls over proliferation rates, expulsion, and lysis. Associations break down in response to certain perturbations, as is illustrated by 'coral bleaching' the collapse of the symbiosis between corals and their symbiotic dinoflagellate algae. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Surprisingly, what traits facilitate range expansions post-introduction is relatively unknown. This information could help predict future expansions of introduced species as well as native species shifting their ranges as climate conditions change. Here, we asked whether specific behavioural and physiological traits were important in the ongoing expansion of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) across Kenya. We predicted that birds at the site of initial introduction (Mombasa, introduced approx. 1950) would behave and regulate corticosterone, a stress hormone, differently than birds at the range edge (Kakamega, approx. 885 km from Mombasa; colonized within the last 5 years). Specifically, we predicted greater exploratory behaviour and stronger corticosterone response to stressors in birds at the range edge, which may facilitate the identification, resolution and memory of stressors. Indeed, we found that distance from Mombasa (a proxy for population age) was a strong predictor of both exploratory behaviour and corticosterone release in response to restraint (but only while birds were breeding). These results suggest that certain behavioural and neuroendocrine traits may influence the ability of species to colonize novel habitats. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

Phenotypic plasticity is a well-studied mechanism in this regard, yet the potentially complex effects of stochastic environmental variation on optimal mean trait values are often overlooked. Using an optimality model inspired by timing of reproduction in great tits, we show that temporal variation affects not only optimal reaction norm slope, but also elevation. With increased environmental variation and an asymmetric relationship between fitness and breeding date, optimal timing shifts away from the side of the fitness curve with the steepest decline. In a relatively constant environment, the timing of the birds is matched with the seasonal food peak, but they become adaptively mismatched in environments with temporal variation in temperature whenever the fitness curve is asymmetric. Various processes affecting the survival of offspring and parents influence this asymmetry, which collectively determine the 'safest' strategy, i.e. whether females should breed before, on, or after the food peak in a variable environment. As climate change might affect the (co)variance of environmental variables as well as their averages, risk aversion may influence how species should shift their seasonal timing in a warming world. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

Fatty acyl CoA elongases are involved in the synthesis of long chain fatty acids (hydrocarbon precursors). Diapause eggs from a temperate population had one-third more surface hydrocarbons and one-half the water loss rates of non-diapause eggs. Eggs from a tropical population reared under SD and LD photoperiods did not differ in surface hydrocarbon abundance or water loss rates. In both a temperate and tropical population, composition of hydrocarbon chain lengths did not differ between eggs from SD versus LD conditions. These results implicate the expression of fatty acyl coA elongase and changes in quantity, but not composition, of egg surface hydrocarbons as important components of increased desiccation resistance during diapause in A. albopictus. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Climate change research is increasingly focusing on the dynamics among species, ecosystems and climates. Better data about the historical behaviours of these dynamics are urgently needed. Such data are already available from ecology, archaeology, palaeontology and geology, but their integration into climate change research is hampered by differences in their temporal and geographical scales. One productive way to unite data across scales is the study of functional morphological traits, which can form a common denominator for studying interactions between species and climate across taxa, across ecosystems, across space and through time-an approach we call 'ecometrics'. The sampling methods that have become established in palaeontology to standardize over different scales can be synthesized with tools from community ecology and climate change biology to improve our understanding of the dynamics among species, ecosystems, climates and earth systems over time. Developing these approaches into an integrative climate change biology will help enrich our understanding of the changes our modern world is undergoing. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

In the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus), an Australian lizard with TSD, data from nests in the field demonstrate that offspring sex ratios are predictable from thermal fluctuations but not from mean nest temperatures. To clarify this paradox, we incubated eggs in a factorial experiment with two levels of mean temperature and three levels of diel fluctuation. We show that offspring sex is determined by an interaction between these critical thermal parameters. Intriguingly, because these two thermal descriptors shift in opposing directions throughout the incubation season, this interactive effect inhibits seasonal shifts in sex ratio. Hence, our results suggest that TSD can yield offspring sex ratios that resemble those produced under genotypic sex-determining systems. These findings raise important considerations for understanding the diversity of TSD reaction norms, for designing experiments that evaluate the evolutionary significance of TSD, and for predicting sex ratios under past and future climate change scenarios. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

Using ruminant diets as environmental proxies, it becomes possible to detect variations in vegetation over time with the potential to explain fluctuations in primate diversity along a NW-SE European transect. Analysis shows that ruminants had diverse diets when primate diversity reached its peak, with more grazers in eastern Europe and more browsers farther west. After the drop in primate diversity, grazers accounted for a greater part of western and central European communities. Eastwards, the converse trend was evident with more browsing ruminants. These opposite trends indicate habitat loss and an increase in environmental uniformity that may have severely favoured the decline of primate diversity. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

In this paper, we present a model of competition between three species in a dynamic landscape, where patches are being created and destroyed at a different rate. In our model, species interact according to a linear non-transitive hierarchy, such that species Y3 outcompetes and can invade patches occupied by species Y2 and this species in turn can outcompete and invade patches occupied by the inferior competitor Y1. In this hierarchy, inferior competitors cannot invade patches of species with higher competitive ability. Analytical results show that there are regions in the parameter space where coexistence can occur, as well as regions where each of the species exists in isolation depending on species' life-history traits associated with their colonization abilities and extinction proneness as well as with the dynamics of habitat patches. In our model, the condition for coexistence depends explicitly on patch dynamics, which in turn modulate the limiting similarity for species coexistence. Coexistence in metacommunities inhabiting dynamic landscapes although possible is harder to attain than in static ones. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The struggle for existence occurs through the vital rates of population growth. This basic fact demonstrates the tight connection between ecology and evolution that defines the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics. An effective synthesis of the interdependencies between ecology and evolution is grounded in six principles. The mechanics of evolution specifies the origin and rules governing traits and evolutionary strategies. Traits and evolutionary strategies achieve their selective value through their functional relationships with fitness. Function depends on the underlying structure of variation and the temporal, spatial and organizational scales of evolution. An understanding of how changes in traits and strategies occur requires conjoining ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Adaptation merges these five pillars to achieve a comprehensive understanding of ecological and evolutionary change. I demonstrate the value of this world-view with reference to the theory and practice of habitat selection. The theory allows us to assess evolutionarily stable strategies and states of habitat selection, and to draw the adaptive landscapes for habitat-selecting species. The landscapes can then be used to forecast future evolution under a variety of climate change and other scenarios. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {A key part of the ecological theory of adaptive radiation is disruptive selection during periods of sympatry. Some insight into this process might be gained by studying populations that are bimodal for dual-context traits, i.e. those showing adaptive divergence and also contributing to reproductive isolation. A population meeting these criteria is the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis) of El Garrapatero, Santa Cruz Island, Galápagos. We examined patterns of selection in this population by relating individual beak sizes to interannual recaptures during a prolonged drought. Supporting the theory, disruptive selection was strong between the two beak size modes. We also found some evidence of selection against individuals with the largest and smallest beak sizes, perhaps owing to competition with other species or to gaps in the underlying resource distribution. Selection may thus simultaneously maintain the current bimodality while also constraining further divergence. Spatial and temporal variation in G. fortis bimodality suggests a dynamic tug of war among factors such as selection and assortative mating, which may alternatively promote or constrain divergence during adaptive radiation. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Phenotypic variability in nature is the most important feature for Darwinian adaptation, yet it has been rarely investigated in invasive species. Zaprionus indianus is an Afrotropical drosophilid species that have recently invaded the Palearctic and the Neotropical regions. Here, we compared the variability of three size-related traits and one meristic trait the sternopleural (STP) bristle number, between wild-collected flies living under different conditions: a stressful Mediterranean environment in Egypt, and a benign tropical environment in Brazil. From each population, a F1 generation was also grown under the stable conditions of the laboratory. Variability of size in nature had a variance 13 times greater than in the laboratory, but not affected by different climates. By contrast, STP variability was identical in nature and in the laboratory. Sexual dimorphism was also investigated with contrasting results between traits. It is suggested that the very high invasiveness of Z. indianus might be related to a better capacity to survive adverse conditions. To cite this article: A. Yassin et al., C. R.

	abstract = {The geographical cline of the coevolving traits of weevil rostrum (mouthpart) length and camellia pericarp (fruit coat) thickness provides an opportunity to test the arms race theory of defense (pericarp thickness) and countermeasure (rostrum length) between antagonistically interacting species. By extending the previous model for the coevolution of quantitative traits to introduce nonlinear costs for exaggerated traits, the generation overlap, and density-dependent regulation in the host, we studied the evolutionarily stable (ES) pericarp thickness in the Japanese camellia (Camellia japonica) and the ES rostrum length in the camellia-weevil (Curculio camelliae). The joint monomorphic ES system has a robust outcome with nonlinear costs, and we analyzed how the traits of both species at evolutionary equilibrium depend on demographic parameters. If camellia demographic parameters vary latitudinally, data collected over the geographical scale of rostrum length and pericarp thickness should lie on an approximately linear curve with the slope less than that of the equiprobability line A/. B of boring success, where A and B are coefficients for the logistic regression of boring success to pericarp thickness and rostrum length, respectively. This is a robust prediction as long as the cost of rostrum length is nonlinear (accelerating). As a result, boring success should be lower in populations with longer rostrum length, as reported in the weevil-camellia system (Toju, H., and Sota, T., 2006a. Imbalance of predator and prey armament: Geographic clines in phenotypic interface and natural selection. American Naturalist 167, 105-117). The nonlinearity (exponent) for the cost of rostrum length estimated from the geographical cline data for the weevil-camellia system was 2.2, suggesting nonlinearity between quadratic and cubic forms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Asexual reproduction imposes evolutionary handicaps on asexual species, rendering them prone to extinction, because asexual reproduction generates novel genotypes and purges deleterious mutations at lower rates than sexual reproduction. Here, we report the first case of complete asexuality in ants, the fungusgrowing ant Mycocepurus smithii, where queens reproduce asexually but workers are sterile, which is doubly enigmatic because the clonal colonies of M. smithii also depend on clonal fungi for food. Degenerate female mating anatomy, extensive field and laboratory surveys, and DNA fingerprinting implicate complete asexuality in this widespread ant species. Maternally inherited bacteria (e.g. Wolbachia, Cardinium) and the fungal cultivars can be ruled out as agents inducing asexuality. M. smithii societies of clonal females provide a unique system to test theories of parent-offspring conflict and reproductive policing in social insects. Asexuality of both ant farmer and fungal crop challenges traditional views proposing that sexual farmer ants outpace coevolving sexual crop pathogens, and thus compensate for vulnerabilities of their asexual crops. Either the double asexuality of both farmer and crop may permit the host to fully exploit advantages of asexuality for unknownreasons or frequent switching between crops (symbiont reassociation) generates novel ant-fungus combinations, which may compensate for any evolutionary handicaps of asexuality in M. smithii. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change has already altered the timing of major life-history transitions, such as the initiation of reproduction. Both phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution can underlie rapid phenological shifts in response to climate change, but their relative contributions are poorly understood. Here, we combine a continuous 38 year field survey with quantitative genetic field experiments to assess adaptation in the context of climate change. We focused on Boechera stricta (Brassicaeae), a mustard native to the US Rocky Mountains. Flowering phenology advanced significantly from 1973 to 2011, and was strongly associated with warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt dates. Strong directional selection favoured earlier flowering in contemporary environments (2010-2011). Climate change could drive this directional selection, and promote even earlier flowering as temperatures continue to increase. Our quantitative genetic analyses predict a response to selection of 0.2 to 0.5 days acceleration in flowering per generation, which could account for more than 20 per cent of the phenological change observed in the long-term dataset. However, the strength of directional selection and the predicted evolutionary response are likely much greater now than even 30 years ago because of rapidly changing climatic conditions. We predict that adaptation will likely be necessary for long-term in situ persistence in the context of climate change. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {A population-genetic analysis is performed of a two-locus two-allele model, in which the primary locus has a major effect on a quantitative trait that is under frequency-dependent disruptive selection caused by intraspecific competition for a continuum of resources. The modifier locus determines the degree of dominance at the trait level. We establish the conditions when a modifier allele can invade and when it becomes fixed if sufficiently frequent. In general, these are not equivalent because an unstable internal equilibrium may exist and the condition for successful invasion of the modifier is more restrictive than that for eventual fixation from already high frequency. However, successful invasion implies global fixation, i.e., fixation from any initial condition. Modifiers of large effect can become fixed, and also invade, in a wider parameter range than modifiers of small effect. We also study modifiers with a direct, frequency-independent deleterious fitness effect. We show that they can invade if they induce a sufficiently high level of dominance and if disruptive selection on the ecological trait is strong enough. For deleterious modifiers, successful invasion no longer implies global fixation because they can become stuck at an intermediate frequency due to a stable internal equilibrium. Although the conditions for invasion and for fixation if sufficiently frequent are independent of the linkage relation between the two loci, the rate of spread depends strongly on it. The present study provides further support to the view that evolution of dominance may be an efficient mechanism to remove unfit heterozygotes that are maintained by balancing selection. It also demonstrates that an invasion analysis of mutants of very small effect is insufficient to obtain a full understanding of the evolutionary dynamics under frequency-dependent selection. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Certain invasive plants may rely on interference mechanisms (. e.g., allelopathy) to gain competitive superiority over native species. But expending resources on interference presumably exacts a cost in another life-history trait, so that the significance of interference competition for invasion ecology remains uncertain. We model ecological invasion when combined effects of preemptive and interference competition govern interactions at the neighborhood scale. We consider three cases. Under "novel weapons," only the initially rare invader exercises interference. For "resistance zones" only the resident species interferes, and finally we take both species as interference competitors. Interference increases the other species' mortality, opening space for colonization. However, a species exercising greater interference has reduced propagation, which can hinder its colonization of open sites. Interference never enhances a rare invader's growth in the homogeneously mixing approximation to our model. But interference can significantly increase an invader's competitiveness, and its growth when rare, if interactions are structured spatially. That is, interference can increase an invader's success when colonization of open sites depends on local, rather than global, species densities. In contrast, interference enhances the common, resident species' resistance to invasion independently of spatial structure, unless the propagation-cost is too great. The particular combination of propagation and interference producing the strongest biotic resistance in a resident species depends on the shape of the tradeoff between the two traits. Increases in background mortality (. i.e., mortality not due to interference) always reduce the effectiveness of interference competition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

There is therefore considerable interest in establishing the degree of plasticity in traits and how selection acts on plasticity in natural populations. Breeding time is a key life-history trait that affects fitness and recent studies have found that females vary significantly in their breeding time-environment relationships, with selection often favouring individuals exhibiting stronger plastic responses. In contrast, here, we show that although breeding time in the common guillemot, Uria aalge, is highly plastic at the population level in response to a large-scale environmental cue (the North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO), there is very little between-individual variation-most individuals respond to this climate cue very similarly. We demonstrate strong stabilizing selection against individuals who deviate from the average population-level response to NAO. This species differs significantly from those previously studied in being a colonial breeder, in which reproductive synchrony has a substantial impact on fitness; we suggest that counter selection imposed by a need for synchrony could limit individuals in their response and potential for directional selection to act. This demonstrates the importance of considering the relative costs and benefits of highly plastic responses in assessing the likely response of a population to the environmental change. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

However, connecting pollution to disease spread remains difficult, in part, because contaminants can simultaneously exert direct and multi-generational effects on several host and parasite traits. To address these challenges, we parametrized a model using a zooplankton-fungus-copper system. In individual-level assays, we considered three sublethal contamination scenarios: no contamination, single-generation contamination hosts and parasites exposed only during the assays and multi-generational contamination hosts and parasites exposed for several generations prior to and during the assays. Contamination boosted transmission by increasing contact of hosts with parasites. However, it diminished parasite reproduction by reducing the size and lifespan of infected hosts. Multi-generational contamination further reduced parasite reproduction. The parametrized model predicted that a single generation of contamination would enhance disease spread via enhanced transmission, whereas multi-generational contamination would inhibit epidemics relative to unpolluted conditions through greatly depressed parasite reproduction. In a population-level experiment, multi-generational contamination reduced the size of experimental epidemics but did not affect Daphnia populations without disease. This result highlights the importance of multi-generational effects for disease dynamics. Such integration of models with experiments can provide predictive power for disease problems in contaminated environments. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {It is now generally acknowledged that climate change has wide-ranging biological consequences, potentially leading to impacts on biodiversity. Environmental factors can have diverse and often strong effects on reproduction, with obvious ramifications for population fitness. Nevertheless, reproductive traits are often neglected in conservation considerations. Focusing on animals, recent progress in sexual selection and sexual conflict research suggests that reproductive costs may pose an underestimated hurdle during rapid climate change, potentially lowering adaptive potential and increasing extinction risk of certain populations. Nevertheless, regime shifts may have both negative and positive effects on reproduction, so it is important to acquire detailed experimental data. We hence present an overview of the literature reporting short-term reproductive consequences of exposure to different environmental factors. From the enormous diversity of findings, we conclude that climate change research could benefit greatly from more coordinated efforts incorporating evolutionary approaches in order to obtain cross-comparable data on how individual and population reproductive fitness respond in the long term. Therefore, we propose ideas and methods concerning future efforts dealing with reproductive consequences of climate change, in particular by highlighting the advantages of multi-generational experimental evolution experiments. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions may expose populations to strong selection for local adaptation along geographical gradients in climate. However, evolution during contemporary timescales can be constrained by low standing genetic variation and genetic correlations among life-history traits. We examined limits to local adaptation associated with northern migration of the invasive wetland plant purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) using a selection model incorporating a trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction, and common garden experiments of populations sampled along a latitudinal transect of approximately 1200 km in eastern North America. A strong trade-off between flowering time and size at reproduction caused early-flowering plants to be smaller with reduced seed production in northern populations. Northward spread was associated with a decline in genetic variance within populations and an increase in genetic skew for flowering time and size, with limited genetic variation for small, early-flowering genotypes. These patterns were predicted by our selection model of local adaptation to shorter growing seasons and were not consistent with expectations from non-adaptive processes. Reduced fecundity may limit population growth and rates of spread in northern populations. Identifying genetic constraints on key life-history traits can provide novel insights into invasion dynamics and the causes of range limits in introduced species. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

Accordingly, the potential of spatial dispersal among introduced individuals compared with local individuals is a key parameter to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of populations after an introduction event. In addition, if the variance in dispersal rate and distance is linked to individual characteristics, this may further affect the population dynamics. We conducted a large-scale experiment where we introduced 123 house sparrows from a distant population into 18 local populations without changing population density or sex ratio. Introduced individuals dispersed more frequently and over longer distances than residents. Furthermore, females had higher probability of dispersal than males. In females, there was also a positive relationship between the wing length and the probability of dispersal and dispersal distance. These results suggest that the distribution and frequency of introduced individuals may be predicted by their sex ratio as well as their phenotypic characteristics. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary branching is the process by which ecological interactions induce evolutionary diversification. In asexual populations with sufficiently rare mutations, evolutionary branching occurs through trait-substitution sequences caused by the sequential invasion of successful mutants. A necessary and sufficient condition for evolutionary branching of univariate traits is the existence of a convergence stable trait value at which selection is locally disruptive. Real populations, however, undergo simultaneous evolution in multiple traits. Here we extend conditions for evolutionary branching to bivariate trait spaces in which the response to disruptive selection on one trait can be suppressed by directional selection on another trait. To obtain analytical results, we study trait-substitution sequences formed by invasions that possess maximum likelihood. By deriving a sufficient condition for evolutionary branching of bivariate traits along such maximum-likelihood-invasion paths (MLIPs), we demonstrate the existence of a threshold ratio specifying how much disruptive selection in one trait direction is needed to overcome the obstruction of evolutionary branching caused by directional selection in the other trait direction. Generalizing this finding, we show that evolutionary branching of bivariate traits can occur along evolutionary-branching lines on which residual directional selection is sufficiently weak. We then present numerical analyses showing that our generalized condition for evolutionary branching is a good indicator of branching likelihood even when trait-substitution sequences do not follow MLIPs and when mutations are not rare. Finally, we extend the derived conditions for evolutionary branching to multivariate trait spaces. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In addition to confirming the importance of previously identified traits (e.g. narrow range size), we find that extrinsic threats (primarily the disease chytridiomycosis and invasive mosquitofish) are equally important and interact with intrinsic traits (primarily ecological group) to create guild-specific pathways to decline in our model system.

For predictive conservation science to be effective, large datasets and integrative models that quantify the relative importance of potential factors and separate rapidly changing from relatively static threat drivers are urgently required. Here, we integrate and map in space the relative and joint effects of key correlates of The International Union for Conservation of Nature-assessed extinction risk for 8700 living birds. Extinction risk varies significantly with species' broad-scale environmental niche, geographical range size, and life-history and ecological traits such as body size, developmental mode, primary diet and foraging height. Even at this broad scale, simple quantifications of past human encroachment across species' ranges emerge as key in predicting extinction risk, supporting the use of land-cover change projections for estimating future threat in an integrative setting. A final joint model explains much of the interspecific variation in extinction risk and provides a remarkably strong prediction of its observed global geography. Our approach unravels the species-level structure underlying geographical gradients in extinction risk and offers a means of disentangling static from changing components of current and future threat. This reconciliation of intrinsic and extrinsic, and of past and future extinction risk factors may offer a critical step towards a more continuous, forward-looking assessment of species' threat status based on geographically explicit environmental change projections, potentially advancing global predictive conservation science. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

In a first attempt to reconcile these two approaches, we developed a simple modelling framework where two strains of pathogens, defined by a pair of life-history traits (infectious period and infectivity), interfere through a given level of cross-immunity.We used whooping cough as a potential example, but the framework proposed here could be applied to other acute infectious diseases. Specifically, we analysed the effects of these parameters on the invasion dynamics of one strain into a population, where the second strain is endemic. Whereas the deterministic version of the model converges towards stable coexistence of the two strains in most cases, stochastic simulations showed that transient epidemic dynamics can cause the extinction of either strain. Thus ecological dynamics, modulated by the immune parameters, eventually determine the adaptive value of different pathogen genotypes.We advocate an integrative view of pathogen dynamics at the crossroads of immunology, epidemiology and evolution, as a way towards efficient control of infectious diseases. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

Prolonged diapause is a major trait in evolution and insect population dynamics, but its effects on invasion speed remain unknown. From a recently developed mathematical approach (integro-difference equations) applied to the insect dormancy, we show that despite a dispersal cost, bet-hedging diapause strategies with low (0.1-0.2) prolonged diapause frequency (emergence after 1 or 2 years) can have a higher invasion speed than a simple diapause strategy (emergence after 1 year) when the environmental stochasticity is sufficiently high. In such conditions, prolonged diapause is a trait supporting invasion capacity by increasing population stochastic growth rate. This conclusion, which applies to a large range of demographic parameters, is in opposition to the usual view that prolonged dormancy is an alternative strategy to dispersal. However, prolonged diapause does not support invasion if the level of environmental stochasticity is low. Therefore, conclusion about its influence on invasion ability needs a good knowledge of environmental stochasticity in the introduction area of considered species. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Process-based crop simulation models require employment of new knowledge for continuous improvement. To simulate growth and development of different genotypes of a given crop, most models use empirical relationships or parameters defined as genetic coefficients to represent the various cultivar characteristics. Such a loose introduction of different cultivar characteristics can result in bias within a simulation, which could potentially integrate to a high simulation error at the end of the growing season when final yield at maturity is predicted. Recent advances in genetics and biomolecular analysis provide important opportunities for incorporating genetic information into process-based models to improve the accuracy of the simulation of growth and development and ultimately the final yield. This improvement is especially important for complex applications of models. For instance, the effect of the climate change on the crop growth processes in the context of natural climatic and soil variability and a large range of crop management options (e.g., N management) make it difficult to predict the potential impact of the climate change on the crop production. Quantification of the interaction of the environmental variables with the management factors requires fine tuning of the crop models to consider differences among different genotypes. In this paper we present this concept by reviewing the available knowledge of major genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for important traits of rice for improvement of rice growth modelling and further requirements. It is our aim to review the assumption of the adequacy of the available knowledge of rice genes and QTL information to be introduced into the models. Although the rice genome sequence has been completed, the development of gene-based rice models still requires additional information than is currently unavailable. We conclude that a multidiscipline research project would be able to introduce this concept for practical applications. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Applying a dynamic and heterogeneous species abundance model we study how differences in extinction time for species in a community act as a force changing the distribution of dynamic parameters across species. This process may generate communities that are more heterogeneous then the heterogeneity measured as the species enter the community.

We present a general model for the hybridization of two plant species to investigate the conditions under which hybrid invasions can occur, and the ecological and genetic consequences of such hybridizations. We find that parental compatibility and fecundity are important determinants of whether (and at what rate) hybrid genotypes emerge. Enhanced hybrid fitness traits affect both the population's genetic structure and total rate of increase, with rapid selection for the fittest genotype. Conversely, if different genotypes maximize different life-history characteristics, the ensuing population can be genetically very variable.

	abstract = {Traditionally, theoretical works on the evolution of virulence of wildlife infections have focused on interactions between just the host and its parasite. In a large number of study cases, however, infected host individuals also incur severe mortality due to predation of higher trophic levels. Such mortality should be virulence-dependent since the population size of predators is determined by the available amount prey they consume, which, in turn, is a function of pathogen virulence. The potential role of trophic pressure by predators in the evolution of virulence of their prey remains largely unaddressed in the literature. Here we investigate the possible role of predators in promoting biodiversity and disruptive evolution (evolutionary branching) of pathogen strains infecting the prey that those predators consume. Our theoretical study is based on principles of adaptive dynamics and evolutionary game theory. With the help of a fairly simple model we demonstrate that predation on infected prey can result in evolutionary branching of pathogen virulence, which would be impossible in the same system without predators. We show that predator-mediated evolutionary branching can occur within a large range of species life-history traits and for various types of transmission-virulence trade-off relation. We argue that predation can play an important role in explaining the existing polymorphism and biodiversity of pathogen strains in wildlife. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we evaluated patterns in species richness, phylogenetic structure and life-history traits of bee communities along altitudinal gradients in the Alps, Germany. We found a linear decline in species richness and abundance but increasing phylogenetic clustering in communities with increasing altitude. The proportion of social- and ground-nesting species, as well as mean body size and altitudinal range of bee communities, increased with increasing altitude, whereas the mean geographical distribution decreased. Our results suggest that community assembly at high altitudes is dominated by environmental filtering effects, whereas the relative importance of competition increases at low altitudes.

	abstract = {Although migration is a widespread and taxonomically diverse behaviour, the ecological factors shaping migratory behaviour are poorly understood. Like other montane taxa, many birds migrate along elevational gradients in the tropics. Forty years ago, Alexander Skutch postulated that severe storms could drive birds to migrate downhill. Here, we articulate a novel mechanism that could link storms to mortality risks via reductions in foraging time and provide, to our knowledge, the first tests of this hypothesis in the White-ruffed Manakin (Corapipo altera), a small partially migratory frugivore breeding on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica. As predicted, variation in rainfall was associated with plasma corticosterone levels, fat stores, plasma metabolites and haematocrit. By collecting data at high and low elevation sites simultaneously, we also found that high-elevation residents were more adversely affected by storms than low elevation migrants. These results, together with striking temporal capture patterns of altitudinal migrants relative to storms, provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that weather-related risks incurred by species requiring high food intake rates can explain altitudinal migrations of tropical animals. These findings resolve conflicting evidence for and against food limitation being important in the evolution of this behaviour, and highlight how endogenous and exogenous processes influence life-history trade-offs made by individuals in the wild. Because seasonal storms are a defining characteristic of most tropical ecosystems and rainfall patterns will probably change in ensuing decades, these results have important implications for understanding the ecology, evolution and conservation of tropical animals. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

Of the insecticides 5 % are biological, and more than 90 % of biological insecticides are based on Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt; Sanchis 2000). The use of bio-insecticides has increased because of the growing need to obtain better quality food and to protect the environment, but very little is known about the impact these organisms have on the environment and mainly on the soil functional microorganism groups. Due to the efficiency of bio-insecticides based on B. thuringiensis, the gene which produces the bio-insecticide crystal was introduced into plants to produce Bt-transgenic plants. Transformed tobacco using the Ti plasmodium from Agrobacterium tumefasciens was obtained in the 1980s. Later, the electroporation and bombardment or bio-ballistic of embryos method, which is more efficient for transformation of a greater number of plant species with the cry B. thuringiensis gene, was used (Peferoen 1997). The second generation of Bt-transgenic plants is presently obtained with the introduction of at least two cry genes in the plant genome, and there are already more than 20 species of transgenic plants of economic importance being used in a few countries (Sanchis 2000). Although transgenic plants have been produced and sown for two decades, there is little information about their environmental impact. Currently proposed plant gene products will probably have less impact on soil ecosystems than some familiar and accepted practices. However, some transgenic plant products may have measurable adverse effects on soil organisms that will have to be monitored for some years after widespread introduction. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004, 2008.},

	abstract = {Crop cultivation in saline soils is one of the major agricultural challenges worldwide. Such soils are often poor in organic matter content and have a low level of microbes, many of which are potentially pathogenic. It requires appropriate biotechnology to introduce plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria for improving crop health, yield, and soil quality in arid saline soils. Introducing such bacterial strains to plant roots can lead to increased plant growth, usually due to enhancing the availability of minerals and nutrients, alleviating salt stress and suppressing plant pathogenic microorganisms. However, harsh conditions, including high salinity and droughts, may reduce the bacterial population introduced into the soil. In such conditions, screening and application of the enhanced potential root-colonizing rhizobacteria is essential for developing sound strategies to manage the rhizosphere in such a way that it becomes more difficult for pathogens to colonize the rhizosphere; thus, these beneficial bacteria can engineer positive interactions in the rhizosphere and stimulate plant growth under saline conditions. Based on these properties and on several tested plant-beneficial traits of the strains, the possible mechanisms behind the beneficial results are discussed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

In these rivers, C. nasus was an introduced species, originating in central Europe, and C. toxostoma was an endemic congener, in the south of France. Stable isotope analysis was used to analyse trophic and spatial niches. Isotopic differences indicated that individuals from the three taxa (C. nasus, C. toxostoma and their hybrid) have different spatial origins. At the interspecific level, the different chondrostomes originating from the Buech River showed a high level of trophic niche overlap. At the intraspecific level, nase individuals originating from the different spatial origins showed a resource polymorphism; differences in morphology were associated with variation in behaviour and life history traits. Their coexistence was a likely outcome of resource polymorphism.

We investigated the specific traits of the hyperparasite and those of the release event which allow a successful regulation of primary parasite populations. This study has been motivated by the case study of chestnut-Cryphonectria parasitica-Cryphonectria Hypovirus interaction. We use a model of SIR/SIS type which assumes a limited diffusion of the parasite. Our model emphasizes the thresholds for invasion linked to the ecological specificities of both the pathogen and the hyperparasite (transmission rates and virulence) and to the initial conditions of the system (population sizes of the different categories). The predictions are consistent with data on the observed spread of the virus. "Mild" strains of the hyperparasite, characterized by a high vertical transmission rate and low virulence, are more prone to establish than "severe" strains. It also demonstrates that the horizontal transmission of the virus, which is controlled by a vegetative incompatibility system in the fungus, is not the unique constraint for the virus establishment. This study may contribute to theoretical and practical aspects of the biological control of plant diseases with a hyperparasite and to the ecology of biological invasions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Models that demonstrate environmental regulation as a consequence of organism and environment coupling all require a number of core assumptions. Many previous models, such as Daisyworld, require that certain environment-altering traits have a selective advantage when those traits also contribute towards global regulation. We present a model that results in the regulation of a global environmental resource through niche construction without employing this and other common assumptions. There is no predetermined environmental optimum towards which regulation should proceed assumed or coded into the model. Nevertheless, polymorphic stable states that resist perturbation emerge from the simulated co-evolution of organisms and environment. In any single simulation a series of different stable states are realised, punctuated by rapid transitions. Regulation is achieved through two main subpopulations that are adapted to slightly different resource values, which force the environmental resource in opposing directions. This maintains the resource within a comparatively narrow band over a wide range of external perturbations. Population driven oscillations in the resource appear to be instrumental in protecting the regulation against mutations that would otherwise destroy it. Sensitivity analysis shows that the regulation is robust to mutation and to a wide range of parameter settings.

	abstract = {In agricultural systems, biodiversity includes diversity within species and among species and provides many benefits for production, resilience and conservation. This article addresses the effects of a strategy of in situ conservation called dynamic management (DM) on population evolution, adaptation and diversity. Two French DM initiatives are considered, the first one corresponding to an experimental context, the second to an on-farm management. Results from a study over 26 years of experimental DM of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are first presented, including the evolution of agronomic traits and genetic diversity at neutral and fitness related loci. While this experiment greatly increased scientific knowledge of the effects of natural selection on cultivated populations, it also showed that population conservation cannot rely only on a network of experimental stations. In collaboration with a farmers' network in France, researchers have begun studying the effects of on-farm DM (conservation and selection) on diversity and adaptation. Results from these studies show that on-farm DM is a key element for the long-term conservation and use of agricultural biodiversity. This method of in situ conservation deserves more attention in industrialised countries. © 2011 Académie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Maternal and physical factors play a significant role in animal life-history variability, which means that large scale climate change has the potential to affect the size and dynamics of animal populations indirectly through maternal investment and directly through conditions that animals are exposed to. However, little is known about the effects of large-scale oceanographic events such as the El-Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) that influence productivity in the Southern Ocean and the abundance, quality and distribution of prey. The possible mechanisms by which physical factors and primary productivity could influence life-history traits, such as survival of apex predators, includes direct influences such as food availability and foraging success and indirect influences such as stored maternal investment and resource transfer during lactation. Here, we quantify the relative contribution of maternal investment and climate conditions at remote foraging sites to survival in the first year of life for southern elephant seals. We present evidence linking climate (ENSO) and variations in a key demographic parameter-first-year survival-and demonstrate that survival was highest during ENSO events and that the ability of mothers to store and acquire resources, which is typically related to ocean productivity, is the most important determinant of survival in the first year. This functional link provides valuable insights that can be used to model the responses of the seal populations to climate change scenarios. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

These two approaches assume that variation in molecular markers reflects variation in ecologically important traits and ignore the possibility of local adaptation among populations that show little divergence or variation at marker loci. Using common garden experiments, we demonstrate that populations of the rare endemic plant Arabis fecunda are physiologically adapted to the local microclimate. Local adaptation occurs despite (i) the absence of divergence at almost all marker loci and (ii) very small effective population sizes, as evidenced by extremely low levels of allozyme and DNA sequence polymorphism. Our results provide empirical evidence that setting conservation priorities based exclusively on molecular marker diversity may lead to the loss of locally adapted populations.},

In boreal forests of Eurasia and North America the natural habitat is changing, mainly because of forestry practices and agriculture. Although there is evidence that the diversity and abundance of animal species are lower in intensively managed than in natural forests, very little is known about how the changes in habitat composition affect reproduction and survival. The best available measure of individual performance in the wild is lifetime reproductive success (LRS), the number of offspring produced during a lifetime, because it combines both survival and reproductive success to a single measure. We show that the LRS of forest-dwelling Tengmalm's owls (Aegolius funereus) increases with the proportion of old forest in the territory because of a higher number of breeding attempts, whereas it decreases with the proportion of agricultural land because of declining fledging success in years when prey populations crashed during owl breeding. These unique results provide an interesting insight into how human influence on the landscape can affect life-history traits of animals through various pathways. © 2004 The Royal Society.},

Natural selection acts against hybrids either because of their incompatible genome, or because of differential adaptation of the pure types across an environmental gradient. Here, we provide experimental evidence that the location of the Bombina (Anura: Discoglossidae) hybrid zone in Croatia is, at least in part, determined by differential adaptation. B. bombina typically breeds in permanent water in the lowland, whereas B. variegata reproduces in puddles at higher elevations. In a reciprocal translocation, pure bombina and variegata tadpoles were introduced in equal proportions into lowland pond enclosures and upland puddles. After three weeks, variegata exceeded bombina in survival and growth in both habitats. The effect was most pronounced in puddles, where the few surviving bombina tadpoles had hardly grown at all. In comparison to variegata, the smaller hatchlings of bombina grew relatively faster in ponds, but remained smaller in absolute terms. Nevertheless, B. bombina appears better adapted to ponds than to puddles. The mechanisms by which variegata is excluded from ponds remain to be demonstrated. These data show that habitat dependent selection prevents the invasion of bombina tadpole traits into the variegata gene pool. Given the strong linkage disequilibria in hybrid populations, differential selection on tadpoles may be sufficient to maintain the integrity of the two gene pools.},

	abstract = {Habitat fragmentation may change local climatic conditions leading to altered selection regimes for life-history traits in small ectotherms, including several insects. We investigated temperature-related performance in terms of fitness among populations of the woodland butterfly Pararge aegeria (L.) originating from populations of a closed, continuous woodland landscape versus populations of an open, highly fragmented agricultural landscape in central Belgium. Female fecundity and longevity were evaluated in a temperature-gradient experiment. As predicted, females of woodland landscape origin reached higher maximum daily fecundity and lifetime number of eggs than did agricultural landscape females at low ambient temperatures, but this reversed at high ambient temperature. Egg weight decreased with temperature, and eggs of woodland butterflies were smaller. Contrary to what is generally assumed, remaining thorax mass was a better predictor of lifetime reproductive output than was abdomen mass. Since we used the F2 generation from wild-caught females reared under common garden conditions, the observed effects are likely to rely on intrinsic, heritable variation. Our results suggest that differential selection regimes associated with different landscapes intervene by intraspecific variation in the response of a butterfly to variation in ambient temperature, and may thus be helpful when making predictions of future impacts on how wild populations respond to environmental conditions under a global change scenario, with increasing temperatures and fragmented landscapes. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

On the contrary, some contemporaneous generalist lineages like Apodemus show a limited morphological evolution. Dental shape can be related to diet and can be used to assess the ecological changes along the lineages. Consequently, size and shape of the first upper molar were measured in order to quantify the patterns of morphological evolution along both lineages and compare them to environmental trends. Climatic changes do not have a direct influence on evolution, but they open new ecological opportunities by changing vegetation and allow the evolution of a specialist like Stephanomys. On the other hand, environmental changes are not dramatic enough to destroy the habitat of a long-term generalist like Apodemus.

In this research, I analyse data on male life histories for a relatively isolated population in rural Belize. Some of the 56 subjects practise subsistence-level slash-and-burn farming, and others are involved in the cash economy. Fecundity levels are quite high in this population, with men over the age of 40 averaging over eight children. Low FA successfully predicted lower morbidity and more offspring fathered, and was marginally associated with a lower age at first reproduction and more lifetime sex partners. These results indicate that FA may be important in predicting human performance in fecundity and morbidity in predemographic transition conditions.},

	abstract = {Climate change is predicted to be most severe in northern regions and there has been much interest in to what extent organisms can cope with these changes through phenotypic plasticity or microevolutionary processes. A red squirrel population in the southwest Yukon, Canada, faced with increasing spring temperatures and food supply has advanced the timing of breeding by 18 days over the last 10 years (6 days per generation). Longitudinal analysis of females breeding in multiple years suggests that much of this change in parturition date can be explained by a plastic response to increased food abundance (3.7 days per generation). Significant changes in breeding values (0.8 days per generation), were in concordance with predictions from the breeder's equation (0.6 days per generation), and indicated that an evolutionary response to strong selection favouring earlier breeders also contributed to the observed advancement of this heritable trait. The timing of breeding in this population of squirrels, therefore, has advanced as a result of both phenotypic changes within generations, and genetic changes among generations in response to a rapidly Changing environment.},

Females may choose brightly coloured males for mating because colour is a reliable signal of a male's genetic resistance to parasites, or that he can bear the cost of the immunosuppressant effects of androgens. Bright yellows, oranges and reds are the product of carotenoid pigments, which are known to have significant health benefits. Therefore, bright colours may be indicative of a bird's quality because it shows access to a superior diet or superior foraging ability. We maintained populations of American kestrels and loggerhead shrikes in captivity that were largely free of parasites and fed a uniform diet. Male kestrels were more brightly coloured than females in the colour of their ceres, lores and legs, and there were pronounced age- and gender-specific patterns to concentrations of carotenoids in their plasma. Even though shrikes do not show any carotenoid-based colouration, the sexes had pronounced differences in plasma carotenoids. Carotenoids in kestrels were unrelated to androgen levels, but the correlation between carotenoids and plasma proteins suggest colour may be a condition-dependent trait. These results suggest that neglected physiological processes may regulate carotenoids, and hence some colour variation need not be explained by parasites, androgens or diet.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, global temperature has increased at an unprecedented rate. This has been causing rapid environmental shifts that have altered the selective regimes determining the annual organization of birds. In order to assess the potential for adaptive evolution in the timing of autumn migration, we estimated heritabilities of the onset of migratory activity in a southern German blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) population. Heritabilities (h2=0.34-0.45) and coefficients of additive genetic variation (CVA=4.7-5.7) were significant and consistent when estimated by different methods, irrespective of whether they were derived from birds hatched in the wild or bred in captivity. In an artificial selection experiment, we selected for later onset of migratory activity, simulating expected natural selection on this trait. We obtained a significant delay in the mean onset of migratory activity by more than one week after two generations of selection. Realized heritability (h2=0.55) was in agreement with expected heritability in the cohort that the selection line was derived from. Our results suggest that evolutionary changes in the timing of autumn migration may take place over a very short time period and will most probably be unconstrained by the lack of additive genetic variation.},

	abstract = {The current theory of natural selection explains that adaptive evolution occurs because genotypes with greater survival or reproductive tendencies, due to their particular biological properties, tend to increase in frequency over the lesser ones in a common environment; therefore, the former will eventually replace the latter. In nature, such a selection process most often occurs in a local population which is nested in a community involving local ecological dynamics which are not clearly articulated in the explanatory scheme of the theory. This paper seeks to explicate such an ecological process giving rise to the evolution of a local population with a particular focus on dynamic effects of an increase in the number of invasive, new types on the fate of old ones. Arguments using the ecological-mechanistic model, representing negative interactions among alternative types of organisms, suggest major ecological mechanisms by which the new replace the old; a selective increase in the number of one type leads to a decrease in the equilibrial abundance of a limiting resource, an increase in the density of conspecifics, and/or an increase in the density of predators, which would in turn lower the per capita reproductive rate, or raise the mortality rate of another and make it extinct. Thus, replacement due to selection is associated with such dynamic shifts in equilibria occurring in a local community. The analysis of three (a resource, a prey and a predator) and four species (those plus a top predator) models suggests that evolutionary processes cannot be predicted without reference to the web structure of the community, that some fitness components causing a selective increase in a particular type can have, in some cases, nothing to do with factors causing selective decreases in alternatives, and that evolution of some traits can occur without resource competition.},

We show that Darwin's finches on a Galapagos island underwent two evolutionary changes after a severe El Nino event caused changes in their food supply. Small beak sizes were selectively favoured in one granivorous species when large seeds became scarce. The effects of selection were transmitted to the next generation as a result of high trait heritabilities. Hybridization between this species and two others resulted in gene exchange, but only after the El Nino when hybrid fitness was much enhanced under the altered feeding conditions. These observations imply that if global warming increases the frequency or severity of El Nino events on the Galapagos, microevolutionary changes in animal and plant populations are to be anticipated.},

This trait relies on individual recognition processes between ewes and lambs. Whereas identification at the udder is only olfactory, distance recognition is performed through visual and acoustic cues. We studied the effectiveness and modalities of mutual acoustic recognition between ewes and lambs by spectrographic analysis of their vocal signatures and by playbacks of modified calls in the field. Our results show that ewes and their lambs can recognize each other based solely on their calls. The coding of identity within the vocal signatures, previously unknown in sheep, is similar in lamb and ewe: it uses the mean frequency and the spectral energy distribution of the call, namely the timbre of the call. These results point out a simple signature system in sheep that uses only the frequency domain. This engenders a signal with low information content, as opposed to some highly social birds and mammal species that may integrate information both in the temporal and spectral domains. The simplicity of this system is linked to the roles played by vision and olfaction that corroborate the information brought by the vocal signature.},

Because many species inhabit heterogeneous environments and have pronounced local adaptations, gene flow between differently adapted populations may be a persistent source of genetic variation within populations. If this migration-selection balance is biologically important then there should be strong correlations between genetic variance within populations and the amount of heterogeneity in the environment surrounding them. Here, we use data from a long-term study of 142 populations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) to compare levels of genetic variation in growth response with measures of climatic heterogeneity in the surrounding region. We find that regional heterogeneity explains at least 20% of the variation in genetic variance, suggesting that gene flow and heterogeneous selection may play an important role in maintaining the high levels of genetic variation found within natural populations. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

Analysis of a modifier of homogenization reveals (1) that the trait is most likely to spread if interactions between deleterious mutations are not strongly synergistic; (2) that selection on the modified is of the order of the mutation rate, hence the modifier is most likely to be favoured by selection when the species has a large effective population size and/or if the modifier affects many genes simultaneously; and (3) that linkage between the genes in the family and between these genes and the modifier, makes invasion of the modifier easier, suggesting that selection may favour multigene families being in clustered arrays. It follows from the first conclusion that genes for which mutations may often be dominant or semi-dominant should undergo concerted evolution more commonly than others. By analysis of the mouse knockout database, we show that mutations affecting growth-related genes are more commonly associated with dominant lethality than expected by chance. We predict then that selection will favour homogenization of such genes, and possibly others that are significantly dosage dependent, more often than it favours homogenization in other genes. The first condition is almost the opposite of that required for the maintenance of sexual reproduction according to the mutation deterministic theory. The analysis here therefore suggests that sexual organisms can simultaneously minimize both the effects of deleterious, strongly synergistically, interacting mutations and those that interact either weakly synergistically, multiplicatively or antagonistically, assuming the latter class belong to a multicopy gene family. Recombination and an absence of homogenization are efficient in purging deleterious mutations in the former class, homogenization and an absence of recombination are efficient at minimizing the costs imposed by the latter classes.},

	abstract = {Aluminium is acutely toxic to fish in acid waters. The gill is the principal target organ and death is due to a combination of ionoregulatory, osmoregulatory and respiratory dysfunction. The toxic mechanism has hitherto received little direct consideration and is unknown. In this paper the mechanism of acute aluminium toxicity is approached from a chemical perspective. Symptomatic evidence of toxicity is taken from the literature and combined with our own research to elucidate a biochemically sound model to describe a possible mechanism of acute aluminium toxicity in fish. The proposed model delineates the chemical conditions immediately adjacent to the gill surface and emphasizes their importance in aluminium's toxic mode of action. The mechanism is shown to be bipartite. Aluminium binding to functional groups both apically located at the gill surface and intracellularly located within lamellar epithelial cells disrupts the barrier properties of the gill epithelium. The concomitant iono- and osmoregulatory dysfunction results in accelerated cell necrosis, sloughing and death of the fish. The mechanism of epithelial cell death is proposed as a general mechanism of aluminium-induced accelerated cell death. © 1991 Academic Press Limited.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive progress in characterizing the genetic events involved in the development of gliomas, the cellular origin and the defined molecular mechanisms that lead to their occurrence are still unclear. It is known that tumours are of monoclonal origin. This is contrasted by the fact that gliomas frequently express features of different glial cell lineages. With the identification of pluripotent neural stem cells and the growth factors that control neural cell development, we are now making early inroads towards understanding glial cell migration as well as the neural cell plasticity within the adult central nervous system (CNS). Gliomas share several fetal antigens with immature brain cells. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the migration of neural precursor cells actually represents the normal counterpart of glioma cell migration. The migratory behavior of gliomas may be due to a predetermined interplay between normal brain tissue and the migrating cells, where the brain represents a permissive tissue for guiding cells with certain phenotypic traits to migrate along specific anatomical structures. Malignant progression is also accompanied by extensive angiogenesis which is especially prominent in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). For cell proliferation to take place, several cell signaling cues mediated by specific growth factors are shared between the glioma cells and the endothelial cells while others are unique for endothelial cells. Therefore the endothelial cell compartment represents a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies including gene therapy and cell-based therapies.},

	abstract = {A major biological problem is how phenotypic clusters, known as species, separated one from the other by prominent phenotypic gaps, are produced. Palaeontological evidence suggests that species remain remarkably stable over long periods of time. When phenotypic change occurs it tends to be abrupt, again producing phenotypic gaps, but now between successive species. A surprisingly simple mechanism might explain both phenomena. Because, by definition, fit traits replace less fit traits, fit traits tend to become common, while maladaptive traits tend to develop low to very low allelomorphic frequencies. Sexual creatures would therefore be expected to prefer mates sporting predominantly common features. This is termed koinophilia. When two polygenic traits initially formed independent, continuously variable, phenotypic dines on a continuous resource gradient, a stochastic computer model of koinophilia invariably caused the de novo evolution of distinct morphospecies separated by prominent phenotypic gaps, involving both traits, under a wide range of selection criteria. Koinophilia reproductively isolated the morphospecies from one another, suggesting that this might be the crucial first step in the development of other barriers to hybridization. The rapidity with which koinophilia canalized the initial continuum of interbreeding phenotypes into reproductively isolated species, and its subsequent defence of those phenotypes against invasion by unusual or unfamiliar phenotypes, might be a paradigm of punctuated equilibrium. © 1995 Academic Press Limited.},

Presence of G. triacanthos juvenile bank was a determinant condition for invasion success. Main parameters influencing invasion velocity were mean seed dispersal distance and minimum reproductive age. Seed production had a small influence on the invasion velocity. Velocities predicted by the model agreed well with estimations from field data. Values of population density predicted matched field values closely.

These species include: Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli. All Shigella species invade the colonic epithelium through M cells and then proceed to spread from cell to cell. Invasion is accompanied by inflammation of the mucosa, a clinical hallmark of the disease. Studies suggest that protective immunity to Shigella is directed to the somatic-O antigen and is type-specific. As with Salmonella vaccines, genetic engineering technology can help prepare more immunogenic Shigella vaccines by precise mutagenesis. These efforts focus either on introducing the metabolic auxotrophies that will result in global attenuation of the organism or on specific virulence-related traits. The principal protective antigen in Shigella infection is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-associated O antigen, which determines the serogroup of the strain. Presentation of Shigella LPS in the context of a non-. Shigella vaccine vector has been possible with the production of-parenteral conjugate vaccines consisting of purified Shigella LPS conjugated to a protein carrier. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play multiple roles in tumor initiation and progression. Tumors frequently appear in areas of chronic inflammation. This is likely aided by the mutagenic actions of macrophages. Tumor growth and progression is supported by macrophage-induced neoangiogenesis and stroma production, and macrophages produce tumor-stimulating growth factors. In most cancers a high density of TAMs predicts poor outcome. But not only do cancer cells depend upon macrophages for growth and invasion, they also co-opt macrophage traits. These include a wide diversity of molecules and pathways regulating adhesion, matrix alterations, neoangiogenesis, motility, chemotaxis, immune signaling pathways and even multidrug resistance proteins. Evidence is presented that these traits could be generated through macrophage-tumor cell fusion. Fusion has been reported in numerous animal tumor models and was recently documented in 2 human cases. Fusion could also account for the high degree of aneuploidy and plasticity in cancer, and for immune evasion. One common trait of myeloid-tumor fusion is the high expression of Beta1,6-branched N-glycans, used by macrophages in systemic migration. Beta1,6-branched oligosaccharides have long been associated with metastasis in animal models and were recently found to be common in a wide diversity of human cancers. We suggest that Beta1,6-branched oligosaccharides in human cancer may reflect widespread tumor cell fusion. Viewing the cancer cell as a myeloid hybrid provides new approaches towards understanding and treating this complex disease.},

	abstract = {I present a framework to study the evolution of traits that allow an organism to survive life-threatening but rare risks. Specifically, I am concerned with risks so rare that any one individual in a population may not experience the risk-causing event in its lifetime. A theory of rare risk management is virtually absent in evolutionary biology, although it is well developed in economics. This is surprising because of the great influence economics had on evolutionary biology, and because biology is full of examples for evolved risk management traits. They include the ability of bacteria to sporulate, of pathogens to survive antibiotic treatment, of temperate bacteriophages to enter a lytic life cycle, as well as traits that allow higher organisms to survive rare environmental disasters, such as sporadic wildfires and irregular flooding. I make predictions about the sustenance of risk management traits under two scenarios, one where the catastrophic events cause individual deaths, and another one where catastrophic events cause population extinction. A well-developed theory of risk management will not only predict the distribution of risk management traits, but may also serve other purposes, such as to reconstruct the spectrum of environments that an organism encountered in its evolutionary history from the record stored in its genome's memory. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Individual resting eggs were obtained from a large selection of lakes which were representative of five endorheic basins and the chain of coastal ponds in the Iberian Peninsula. The novel use of resting eggs allows the integration of seasonal and annual variations as well as the impact of stochastic effects such as drift and local extinction. A 653 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene was sequenced from 98 eggs. Our results revealed a deep phylogeographical structure in this species, with a division into two main lineages with distinct geographical distributions, which probably diverged at the beginning of the Pleistocene period. Most of the mitochondrial DNA haplotypes were restricted to single lakes. Nested clade analysis supported Early Pleistocene fragmentation of populations, low gene flow and some long-distance colonization. These conclusions contrast strongly with previous ideas on rotifer biogeography and this pattern is consistent with a recolonization of the Iberian Peninsula from two glacial refugia. The results provide new insights into the processes responsible for the genetic diversification of passive dispersers, a life-history trait typical of zooplanktonic biotas.},

	abstract = {Although the impacts of exotic plant invasions on community structure and ecosystem processes are well appreciated, the pathways or mechanisms that underlie these impacts are poorly understood. Better exploration of these processes is essential to understanding why exotic plants impact only certain systems, and why only some invaders have large impacts. Here, we review over 150 studies to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the impacts of exotic plant invasions on plant and animal community structure, nutrient cycling, hydrology and fire regimes. We find that, while numerous studies have examined the impacts of invasions on plant diversity and composition, less than 5% test whether these effects arise through competition, allelopathy, alteration of ecosystem variables or other processes. Nonetheless, competition was often hypothesized, and nearly all studies competing native and alien plants against each other found strong competitive effects of exotic species. In contrast to studies of the impacts on plant community structure and higher trophic levels, research examining impacts on nitrogen cycling, hydrology and fire regimes is generally highly mechanistic, often motivated by specific invader traits. We encourage future studies that link impacts on community structure to ecosystem processes, and relate the controls over invasibility to the controls over impact.},

	abstract = {An 'adaptive dynamics' modelling approach to the evolution of dominance-recessivity is presented. In this approach, fitness derives from an explicit ecological scenario, and both evolutionary attractivity and invasibility of resident populations are examined. The ecology consists of a within-individual part representing a locus with regulated activity and a between-individual part that is a two-patch soft selection model. Evolutionary freedom is allowed at a single locus. The evolutionary analysis considers directed random walks on trait space, generated by repeated invasions of mutants. The phenotype of an individual is determined by allelic parameters. Mutations can have two effects: they either affect the affinity of the promoter sequence for transcription factors, or they affect the gene product. The dominance interaction between alleles derives from their promoter affinities. Additive genetics is evolutionarily unstable when selection and evolution maintain two alleles in the population. In such a situation, dominance interactions can become stationary and close to additive genetics or they continue to evolve at a very slow pace towards dominance-recessivity. The probability that a specific dominance interaction will evolve depends on the relative mutation rate of promoter compared to gene product and the distribution of mutational effect sizes. Either allele in the dimorphism can become dominant, and dominance-recessibility is always most likely to evolve. Evolution then approaches a population state where every phenotype has maximum viability in one of the two patches. When the within-individual part is replaced by a housekeeping locus that codes for a metabolic enzyme, evolution favours a population of two alleles under the same conditions as for a regulated locus. In the case of a housekeeping gene, however, the evolutionary dynamical system approaches a population state where the heterozygote and only one homozygote phenotype are equivalent to the optimum phenotypes in the two patches.},

Human hunting is implicated in these extinctions, but the impact of hunting is difficult to disentangle from the effects of other changes induced by humans, including habitat destruction and the introduction of other mammalian predators. Here, we use data from bones collected at a natural sand dune site and associated archaeological middens in New Zealand to show that, having controlled for differences in body mass and family membership (and hence for variation in life-history traits related to population growth rate), birds that were more intensively hunted by prehistoric humans had a higher probability of extinction. This result cannot be attributed to preservation biases and provides clear evidence that selective hunting contributed significantly to prehistoric bird extinctions at this site.},

	abstract = {Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA elements that replicate in an autonomous, self-controlled way and that exist with characteristic copy numbers within a host organism [7,10]. They are mostly organized as double-stranded circular DNA molecules with closed strands that can be isolated in the form of supercoiled DNA. Concerning their genetic organization, plasmids contain an essential DNA region, the basic replicon, which comprises the genes and loci involved in autonomous replication and replication control. Additionally, plasmids may encode auxiliary inheritance mechanisms ensuring their stable maintenance and faithful segregation during cell division [18,15]. Plasmids may also carry genes that could be considered dispensable, although they might play an important or beneficial role for the plasmid itself and/or its host organism. Furthermore, plasmids favor the genetic exchange in bacterial populations since they cannot only incorporate, but also deliver additional genetic material by recombination processes or transposition. This so-called gene load may be involved, for instance, in antibiotic or toxic heavy metal resistance or it may confer favorable physiological traits on the host [68]. Since plasmids can be introduced into new host species by a variety of transfer mechanisms, they can be considered to represent an easy, accessible pool of horizontal mobile DNA, which is shared among bacterial populations. Consequently, plasmids play a major role in enhancing the genetic diversity and adaptation of bacteria by transferring their gene load into new host species [31]. © 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Phenotypic variation among cohorts was pronounced for calves, yearlings and reproductively mature adults. Fluctuations in cohort-specific mean body weights and skeletal ratios of adults correlated with global climatic variation in winter conditions influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation while cohorts were in utero. Red deer born following warm winters were smaller than those born after cold winters, and this inter-cohort variability persisted into adulthood. Phenotypic variation among cohorts of red deer influenced by climate change may pose consequences for fitness of cohorts since body size and condition contribute to reproductive success and survival in male and female red deer. In particular, the recent trend of increasingly warm winters in northern Europe and Scandinavia may lead to reduced body size and fecundity of red deer, and perhaps other ungulates, in those areas.},

	abstract = {Enterococci are commensal organisms well suited to survival in intestinal and vaginal tracts and the oral cavity. However, as for most bacteria described as causing human disease, enterococci also possess properties that can be ascribed roles in pathogenesis. The natural ability of enterococci to readily acquire, accumulate, and share extrachromosomal elements encoding virulence traits or antibiotic resistance genes lends advantages to their survival under unusual environmental stresses and in part explains their increasing importance as nosocomial pathogens. This review discusses the current understanding of enterococcal virulence relating to (i) adherence to host tissues, (ii) invasion and abscess formation, (iii) factors potentially relevant to modulation of host inflammatory responses, and (iv) potentially toxic secreted products. Aggregation substance, surface carbohydrates, or fibronectin-binding moieties may facilitate adherence to host tissues. Enterococcus faecalis appears to have the capacity to translocate across intact intestinal mucosa in models of antibiotic-induced superinfection. Extracellular toxins such as cytolysin can induce tissue damage as shown in an endophthalmitis model, increase mortality in combination with aggregation substance in an endocarditis model, and cause systemic toxicity in a murine peritonitis model. Finally, lipoteichoic acid, superoxide production, or pheromones and corresponding peptide inhibitors each may modulate local inflammatory reactions.},

	abstract = {Aerial dispersal by ballooning is a passive flight, by which wind drag generates an upward lift on a silk thread. It is likely to reflect an aerial lottery, in which the absence of flight direction control is a serious cost for long-distance dispersal in a fragmented landscape. For species occurring in one patchily distributed habitat type, dispersal should evolve in a different way from morphological traits, directly linked to active dispersal. Therefore, we expect that if the risk of landing in an unsuitable habitat is lower than the probability of reaching a suitable habitat, selection should benefit a well-developed ballooning behaviour. We investigated interspecific variation in the ballooning-initiating tiptoe behaviour as it is linked to spider dispersal performance. Our results indeed indicate that ballooning performance is negatively related to habitat specialization in spiders from patchy grey dunes, so habitat specialists are characterized by poorly developed dispersal behaviour. These findings are concordant with recent insights that dispersal is selected as risk spreading in generalists, while it is selected against in specialist species.},

Seasonality in disease incidence has been attributed to seasonal changes in pathogen transmission rates, resulting from fluctuations in extrinsic climate factors. Multi-strain infectious diseases with strain-specific seasonal signatures, such as cholera, indicate that a range of seasonal patterns in transmission rates is possible in identical environments. We therefore consider pathogens capable of evolving their 'seasonal phenotype', a trait that determines the sensitivity of their transmission rates to environmental variability. We introduce a theoretical framework, based on adaptive dynamics, for predicting the evolution of disease dynamics in seasonal environments. Changes in the seasonality of environmental factors are one important avenue for the effects of climate change on disease. This model also provides a framework for examining these effects on pathogen evolution and associated disease dynamics. An application of this approach gives an explanation for the recent cholera strain replacement in Bangladesh, based on changes in monsoon rainfall patterns. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

It is known that tumours are of monoclonal origin. This is contrasted by the fact that gliomas frequently express features of different glial cell lineages. With the identification of pluripotent neural stem cells and the growth factors that control neural cell development, we are now making early inroads towards understanding glial cell migration as well as the neural cell plasticity within the adult central nervous system (CNS). Gliomas share several fetal antigens with immature brain cells. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the migration of neural precursor cells actually represents the normal counterpart of glioma cell migration. The migratory behavior of gliomas may be due to a predetermined interplay between normal brain tissue and the migrating cells, where the brain represents a permissive tissue for guiding cells with certain phenotypic traits to migrate along specific anatomical structures. Malignant progression is also accompanied by extensive angiogenesis which is especially prominent in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). For cell proliferation to take place, several cell signaling cues mediated by specific growth factors are shared between the glioma cells and the endothelial cells while others are unique for endothelial cells. Therefore the endothelial cell compartment represents a promising target for novel therapeutic strategies including gene therapy and cell-based therapies.},

	abstract = {The house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus) of eastern North America was introduced onto Long Island, New York, around 1940. The source is presumed to be southern California, where ca. 80% of individuals are completely sedentary. The eastern population has become migratory: by the early 1960s, 36% of eastern house finches were performing migratory movements (more than 80 km from their banding site) and that proportion has fluctuated between 28 and 54% in succeeding years. The movements of birds banded during the breeding season and recovered in winter were strongly orientated towards the south-west, and the same pattern was evident in the earliest recoveries (1958-1966); recoveries of birds banded during winter and recovered in the breeding season were orientated toward the north-east. The average distance of migration has continued to increase logarithmically. Areas colonized later, as the range expanded, were characterized by initial long migration distances and high proportions of migrants, suggesting that these traits have evolved in the eastern population. Eastern house finches are partial migrants: not all individuals migrate, and birds that migrate some winters remain in breeding areas in others. Younger birds exhibit a stronger tendency to migrate.

	abstract = {Although approximately 12% of the world's population is infected with E. histolytica, only 10% of those infected will develop clinical symptoms, and of this group, only 2 to 20% will have invasive disease. It has been postulated that the large number of asymptomatic people are infected with a nonpathogenic strain that cannot be distinguished morphologically from pathogenic strains. It has been shown that pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains can be differentiated by the use of isoenzyme (zymodeme) analysis, monoclonal antibodies, and molecular probes, and the results correlate with clinical symptoms and serological tests. Whether the isoenzyme patterns are a phenotypic or genotypic trait will have to be answered by future research. It is possible to transfer genetic material between organisms, thus transforming one pathogenic zymodeme into a completely different pathogenic zymodeme, and the presence or absence of specific bacterial flora has been associated with the interconversion of nonpathogenic and pathogenic strains in culture. Mirelman (87) found that nonpathogenic E. histolytica isolates contain extrachromosomal DNA that hybridizes with pathogen-specific DNA probes. However, through the use of recombinant DNA technology, two genetically distinct forms of E. histolytica have been found to exist. Genetic analysis has shown substantial differences between the nonpathogenic and pathogenic forms. Until our understanding of the pathogens is elucidated, there will continue to be questions concerning the influence of bacterial flora and genetic exchange between isolates. Because of the uncertainty of isoenzyme stability, the expression or repression of pathogenic genes, or transfer of genetic material between organisms, the designation of an organism as nonpathogenic or pathogenic should not be solely relied on for therapeutic purposes. Although recent research has helped to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of organism attachment, cytolysis, and phagocytosis of host cells, pathogenesis is still not well understood, even though E. histolytica has been studied for over 100 years. Most recent work cited has dealt with the galactose-specific lectin receptor of E. histolytica. Prevention or alteration of attachment may eliminate the pathogenicity of this organism. The sequencing of this receptor and others involved in attachment may lead in the near future to a vaccine or a specific therapeutic agent that will prevent or reduce the pathological sequelae associated with pathogenic zymodemes. Diagnosis of E. histolytica infections depends primarily on examinations for ova and parasites and on serological tests. There are no commercially available or practical and reliable methods for differentiating pathogenic from nonpathogenic strains for routine use in clinical laboratories. Currently, there are no antigen tests for routine clinical laboratory use, and monoclonal antibodies and DNA probe tests have been used only with culture isolates to detect pathogenic zymodemes. With the current interest in developing genomic libraries (51) and in using amplification methods to selectively look at specific functions of the organism, our knowledge of E. histolytica will be considerably enhanced. Amplification methods and serological tests that are sensitive and specific enough to directly detect very small numbers of organisms are currently needed. In the near future, clinical laboratories will be evaluating a number of new test products for diagnosing infections caused by pathogenic E. histolytica.},

	abstract = {A goal of life-history theory has been to understand what combination of demographic traits is maximized by natural selection. In practice, researchers usually choose either density-independent population growth rate, λ, or lifetime reproductive success, R0 (expected number of offspring produced in a lifetime). Others have shown that the maxima of density-independent λ and R0 are evolutionarily stable strategies under specific density-dependent conditions: population regulation by equal density dependence among all age classes for λ and by density dependence on a single age class for R0. Here I extend these connections between density-independent optimization models and density-dependent invasion function models in two ways. First, I derive a new demographic function for which a maximum corresponds to attainability of the equilibrium strategy or stability of the mean rather than stability of the variance of the strategy distribution. Second, I show explicitly a continuous range of cases with maxima between those for the λ and R0. Graphical and biological interpretations are given for an example model. Finally, exceptions to a putative life-history generality (from λ and R0 models), that high early-life mortality selects for high iteroparity, are shown.},

	abstract = {Empirical evidence for between-trait correlation in fluctuating asymmetry (FA) at the individual level is generally lacking or contradictory. Yet the assumption of organism-wide asymmetry, estimated by the asymmetry of any given trait, is inherent to most studies that use FA as a measure of developmental stability (DS). A commonly assumed reason for this weak between-trait correlation is the low repeatability of individual, single-trait asymmetry. In this paper we describe high repeatability and significant between-trait correlation in population- and individual-level FA in five afrotropical bird species inhabiting a fragmented cloud forest. Absence of anti-symmetry and of between-trait correlation in signed FA levels permits us to translate the observed patterns into the presumed underlying DS, using the concept of hypothetical repeatability. This correction, which has not been applied before in this context, proved adequate as it yielded correlations comparable to those found at the population level.},
