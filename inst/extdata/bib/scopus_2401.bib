	abstract = {Background: Mucormycosis is a life-threatening infection due to the members of the Mucorales order with increasing incidence during the last decades. Rhizopus spp. are the most common causes of disease; however, this infection could be developed by various other species. Objectives: This study presented the clinical features and predisposing factors of several patients with mucormycosis along with the causative agents using sequence analysis. Methods: Clinical specimens of 25 cases with mucormycosis were included in this study. Direct examination and culture were performed for all specimens and then isolated fungi were identified based on their morphology and sequence analysis of ribosomal DNA. Results: The patients were comprised of 17 (68%) females and 8 (32%) males with the mean age of 47.16 ± 17.4 years. Rhino-cerebral mucormycosis was the most common clinical form (24 cases) followed by pulmonary mucormycosis (one case). Diabetes mellitus was the most common predisposing factor (n = 17, 68%). The culture was positive in 15 specimens and the isolated fungi were mor-phologically identified as Rhizopus spp., subsequently, all of the isolates were identified as Rhizopus oryzae at the species level using the molecular method. Conclusions: Diabetes and R. oryzae played the most important roles as the predisposing factor and etiologic agent of mucormycosis, respectively. © 2019, Archives of Clinical Infectious Diseases.},

	abstract = {Two experiments were conducted in this study, using 250 Oreochromis niloticus (O. niloticus) (average weight 30.28 ± 0.27 g). The first experiment was conducted to investigate the 96-h lethal concentration 50 (LC50) of copper chloride (CuCl2) using the probit analysis, seventy fish was divided into seven different concentration of CuCl2 (0, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27 mg/L), the accurate Cu concentrations were (1.23, 5.36, 6.02, 6.98, 7.05, 7.93, 8.12 mg/L Cu). The second experiment was conducted for investigating the effect of dietary supplementation with thyme (Thymus vulgaris, T. vulgaris) and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum, O. basilicum) essential oils (TEO and BEO respectively) against sub-lethal Cu exposure (1/10 96-h LC50 of CuCl2). About 180 fish was divided into six groups in triplicate (10 fish/replicate, 30 fish/group). Group 1 (C) was kept as a control group with no Cu exposure and was fed the control basal diet. Group 2 (C–Cu) was fed the control basal diet and simultaneously exposed to 1/10 of the 96 h LC50 of CuCl2 (2.574 mg/L) as a sub-lethal concentration of Cu, where the realistic Cu concentration was 3.976 mg/L. Group 3 (TEO) and group 4 (BEO) were fed the diets fortified with 1%TEO and BEO, respectively without exposure to Cu. Group 5 (TEO-Cu) and group 6 (BEO-Cu) were fed the diets fortified with 1%TEO and 1%BEO, respectively, and simultaneously exposed to 1/10 of the 96 h LC50 of CuCl2 (2.574 mg/L). The growth and behavioral performance, immunological response and its related gene expression, antioxidant status, stress biomarker indicators, apoptosis biomarkers, and histopathological alteration were investigated. The results of the first experiment showed that the 96-h LC50 of CuCl2 in O. niloticus was 25.740 mg/L with lower and upper confidence limits of 25.152 and 26.356 mg/L, respectively. The results of the second experiment showed that sub-lethal Cu exposure induced growth retardation (lowered final body weight, total weight gain, and specific growth rate %), behavioral abnormalities (slower swimming activity and feeding performance), immunosuppression (lowered nitric oxide, complement-3, lysozyme, total proteins, albumin, and globulin), and lowering the hepatic antioxidant functions (higher MDA, and lower SOD, CAT, and GPx) in the exposed fish. Furthermore, alteration in the immune-related genes expression (down-regulation of IL-10 and TGF-β and up-regulation of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and TRL-4), hepato-renal dysfunction (elevated ALT, AST, urea, and creatinine), and high levels of serum stress indicators (cortisol and glucose) were markedly evident. sub-lethal Cu toxicity induced significant up-regulation of apoptosis biomarkers involving, nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ), Bcl-2 Associated X-protein (BAX), meanwhile, the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was remarkably down-regulated. In addition, apoptosis was also evident by histopathological investigation of branchial, hepatic, and renal sections. TEO and/or BEO dietary supplementation mitigate the destructive impacts of sub-lethal Cu exposure in O. niloticus, depending on the results of our study, it could be concluded that TEO and BEO with a 1% dietary level could be a promising antioxidant, immunostimulant, anti-stress factors, and anti-apoptosis mediators against heavy metal contaminants (Cu) in O. niloticus, providing a solution to the problem of aquatic bodies pollution, consequently aiding in the development of aquaculture industry. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microbiome analysis has identified a state of microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) in patients with chronic intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer. The bacterial phylum Proteobacteria is often overrepresented in these individuals, with Escherichia coli being the most prevalent species. It is clear that a complex interplay between the host, bacteria and bacterial genes is implicated in the development of these intestinal diseases. Understanding the basic elements of these interactions could have important implications for disease detection and management. Recent studies have revealed that E. coli utilizes a complex arsenal of virulence factors to colonize and persist in the intestine. Some of these virulence factors, such as the genotoxin colibactin, were found to promote colorectal cancer in experimental models. In this Review, we summarize key features of the dysbiotic states associated with chronic intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer, and discuss how the dysregulated interplay between host and bacteria could favor the emergence of E. coli with pathological traits implicated in these pathologies. © 2014, Company of Biologists Ltd.

	abstract = {The introduction of oil-adjuvanted vaccines in salmon aquaculture made large-scale production feasible by reducing the impact of infections. Vaccines given intraperitoneally (ip) contain oil adjuvant such as mineral oil. However, in rodents, a single ip injection of adjuvant hydrocarbon oil induces lupus-like systemic autoimmune syndrome. We have recently reported that autoimmune disease in farmed salmon, characterized by production of various autoantibodies, immune complex glomerulonephritis, liver thrombosis, and spinal deformity, are previously unrecognized side effects of vaccination. In the present study, we examined whether vaccination-induced autoantibody production in farmed Atlantic salmon is a mere result of polyclonal B-cell activation. Sera were collected from 205 vaccinated and unvaccinated Atlantic salmon (experimental, 7 farms) and wild salmon. Total IgM levels and autoantibodies to salmon blood cell (SBC) extract in sera were measured by ELISA and the relationship between hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody production was analyzed. Comparison of endpoint titers vs levels/units using a single dilution of sera in detection of autoantibodies to SBC showed near perfect correlation, justifying the use of the latter for screening. Both total IgM and anti-SBC antibodies are increased in vaccinated salmon compared with unvaccinated controls, however, they do not always correlate well when compared between groups or between individuals, suggesting the involvement of antigen-specific mechanisms in the production of anti-SBC autoantibodies. The primary considerations of successful vaccine for aquaculture are cost-effectiveness and safety. Vaccination-induced autoimmunity in farmed Atlantic salmon may have consequences on future vaccine development and salmon farming strategy. Evaluation for polyclonal hypergamamglobulinemia and autoimmunity should be included as an important trait when vaccine efficacy and safety are evaluated in future. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) is a high economic value aquacultural fish in China, however, it often suffers from the outbreak of parasitic ciliate Cryptocaryon irritans as well as bacterium Vibrio harveyi which bring great loss in grouper farming. In the present study, we established a high dose C. irritans local-infected model which caused the mortality of groupers which showed low vitality and histopathological analysis demonstrated inflammatory response and degeneration in infected skin, gill and liver. In addition, gene expression of inﬂammatory cytokines was detected to assist the estimate of inflammatory response. Furthermore, we also found that the activity of Na+/K+ ATPase in gill was decreased in groupers infected C. irritans and the concentration of Na+/Cl− in blood were varied. Base on the morbidity symptom occurring in noninfected organs, we hypothesized that the result of morbidity and mortality were due to secondary bacterial infection post parasitism of C. irritans. Moreover, four strains of bacteria were isolated from the infected site skin and liver of local-infected groupers which were identified as V. harveyi in accordance of phenotypic traits, biochemical characterization and molecular analysis of 16S rDNA genes, housekeeping genes (gyrB and cpn60) and species-specific gene Vhhp2. Regression tests of injecting the isolated strain V. harveyi has showed high pathogenicity to groupers.

	abstract = {The innate immunity of invertebrates serves as a critical trait that provides a valuable foundation for studying the common biological responses to environmental changes. With the exponential growth of the human population, the demand for protein has soared, leading to the intensification of aquaculture. Regrettably, this intensification has resulted in the overuse of antibiotics and chemotherapeutics, which have led to the emergence of resistant microbes or superbugs. In this regard, biofloc technology (BFT) emerges as a promising strategy for disease management in aquaculture. By harnessing the power of antibiotics, probiotics, and prebiotics, BFT offers a sustainable and eco-friendly approach that can help mitigate the negative impacts of harmful chemicals. By adopting this innovative technology, we can enhance the immunity and promote the health of aquatic organisms, thereby ensuring the long-term viability of the aquaculture industry. Using a proper carbon to nitrogen ratio, normally adding an external carbon source, BFT recycles waste in culture system with no water exchange. Heterotrophic bacteria grow along with other key microbes in the culture water. Heterotrophs play a major role in assimilating ammonia from feed and fecal waste, crucial pathway to form suspended microbial aggregates (known as ‘biofloc’); while chemoautotrophs (e.g. nitrifying bacteria) oxidize ammonia into nitrite, and nitrite into nitrate promoting a healthy farming conditions. By using a highly aerated media and an organic substrates that contain carbon and nitrogen, protein-rich microbes are able to flocculate in culture water. Several types of microorganisms and their cell components have been studied and applied to aquatic animals as probiotics or immunostimulants (lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and 1-glucans) to enhance their innate immunity and antioxidant status, thereby enhancing their resistance to disease. In recent years, many studies have been conducted on the application of BFT for different farmed aquatic species and it has been observed as a promising method for the development of sustainable aquaculture, especially due to less use of water, increased productivity and biosecurity, but also an enhancement of the health status of several aquaculture species. This review analyses the immune status, antioxidant activity, blood and biochemical parameters, and level of resistance against pathogenic agents of aquatic animals farmed in BFT systems. This manuscript aims to gather and showcase the scientific evidences related to biofloc as a ‘health promoter’ in a unique document for the industry and academia. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Targeted cell migration plays important roles in developmental biology and disease processes, including in metastasis. Drosophila tumors exhibit traits characteristic of human cancers, providing a powerful model to study developmental and cancer biology. We now find that cells derived from Drosophila eye-disc tumors also display organ-specific metastasis, invading receptive organs but not wing disc. Toll receptors are known to affect innate immunity and the tumor inflammatory microenvironment by modulating the NF-κB pathway. Our RNA interference (RNAi) screen and genetic analyses show that Toll-6 is required for migration and invasion of the tumor cells. Further, receptive organs express Toll ligands [Spätzle (Spz) family molecules], and ectopic Spz expression renders the wing disc receptive to metastasis. Finally, Toll-6 promotes metastasis by activating JNK signaling, a key regulator of cell migration. Hence, we report Toll-6 and Spz as a new pair of guidance molecules mediating organ-specific metastatic behavior and highlight a novel signaling mechanism for Toll-family receptors. © 2019.

	abstract = {Outbreaks of mass mortalities occurred in Macrobrachium rosenbergii farms in Gaoyou county, Jiangsu Province of China. The bacterial isolates from M. rosenbergii exhibited the same phenotypic traits and biochemical characteristics, and were identified as non-O1/O139 Vibrio cholerae according to biochemical characteristics and molecular identification. In challenge test, M. rosenbergii infected with non-O1/O139 V. cholerae GXFL1-4 developed similar pathological signs to the naturally diseased prawns, and LD50 of the strain to M. rosenbergii was 4.5 × 106 CFU/mL at 96 h post-infection. Histopathological analysis revealed that hepatopancreas and intestines of diseased M. rosenbergii exhibited obvious inflammatory responses to non-O1/O139 V. cholerae infection. Detection virulence factors of the strain GXFL1-4 showed that the bacteria produced caseinase, lipase, amylase, lecithinase and hemolysin, and carried toxR, hlyA, ompW, ompU, hap, rtxA and rtxC virulence related genes, supporting the strong virulence to M. rosenbergii. Additionally, the immune related gene expression in M. rosenbergii evaluated by qRT-PCR analysis showed that HSP70, Crustin, Lysozyme, TRL1, ALF1, Lectin, Peroxinectin, proPO and SOD immune related genes were significantly up-regulated at 6 and 12 h after infection with GXFL1-4. The results of our study suggested that non-O1/O139 V. cholerae was an etiological element in the mass mortalities of M. rosenbergii and this study provided preliminary insights into the diversity in the immune response of M. rosenbergii to the bacterial invasion. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study addresses the plant beneficial enterobacteria present in rice rhizosphere and their efficiency for enhancing nitrogen uptake in rice plant. Using culturable approaches, the population of total diazotrophs present in rhizosphere samples collected from different organic rice fields of Sikkim were studied and recorded in the range between 4.62 to 4.97 log10 CFU/g soil. All the isolated commonly occurred diazotrophic bacterial isolates were screened based on their ability to fix nitrogen in milligram per gram of sugar consumed under in-vitro condition with the reference check. In addition to nitrogen fixation, plant growth promoting traits such as production of indole-3-acetic acid and gibberellic acid were estimated using spectrophotometric approaches and compared against Bacillus subtilis as reference multi-potent plant growth promoting strain. In-vivo evaluation of these diazotrophic species in rice found improvement in both above and below ground responses in rice plant evaluated by estimating changes in chlorophyll concentration, plant biomass, root architecture, nitrogen uptake, microbial biomass and associated biochemical activity of soil. Further, the selected isolates were identified through DNA targeted analysis of 16S rRNA gene present in diazotrophs and which identified that the isolates belonged to the Enterobacter genus. Statistical models were prepared for deciphering the dynamics of plant growth improvement due to selective enrichment of rhizosphere bacteria and found significant (p<0.05) correlation between soil and plant parameters. This study concludes that Enterobacter spp. present in organic paddy soils of Sikkim having good nitrogen fixing abilities and whose selective enrichment in rhizosphere improved nitrogen uptake and plant growth promotion in rice plant. © 2021},

	abstract = {High temperature has direct confinement on fish survival and growth, especially under the background of global warming. Selection of fish line with heat resistance is an important means to address this problem. In the present study, we analyzed the difference in heat resistance between families of olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus and turbot Scophthalmus maximus, two flatfish species occupying slightly different thermal niches. Then the chosen families were tested to determine their differential response to heat stress (ΔT = +8 °C and +12 °C) in blood, including anaerobic metabolism (lactate), oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation) and antioxidant enzymes. Results showed a difference in heat resistance between families of the two species. Among the chosen parameters, growth traits had a significant effect on contents of lactate and malondialdehyd (MDA), and activities of catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase in flounder (P < 0.05), and on MDA content and CAT activity in turbot (P < 0.05). In comparison with heat-sensitive family of each species, levels of all studied parameters were lower and more stable in heat-resistant families after heat stress. What's more, heat resistance of fish significantly influenced contents of lactate and MDA and activity of CAT in flounder (P < 0.05), as well as contents of lactate, MDA and carbonyl and activity of superoxide dismutate (SOD) in turbot (P < 0.05). These results demonstrated that such physiological phenotypes as anaerobic metabolism, oxidative stress and antioxidant enzymes are good biomarkers of fish heat-resistance, being potentially valuable in fish breeding. However, these markers should be applied with more caution when there is a growth discrepancy between fish families. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Modern intensive agricultural practices face numerous challenges that pose major threats to global food security. In order to address the nutritional requirements of the ever-increasing world population, chemical fertilizers and pesticides are applied on large scale to increase crop production. However, the injudicious use of agrochemicals has resulted in environmental pollution leading to public health hazards. Moreover, agriculture soils are continuously losing their quality and physical properties as well as their chemical (imbalance of nutrients) and biological health. Plant-associated microbes with their plant growth- promoting traits have enormous potential to solve these challenges and play a crucial role in enhancing plant biomass and crop yield. The beneficial mechanisms of plant growth improvement include enhanced nutrient availability, phytohormone modulation, biocontrol of phytopathogens and amelioration of biotic and abiotic stresses. Solid-based or liquid bioinoculant formulation comprises inoculum preparation, addition of cell protectants such as glycerol, lactose, starch, a good carrier material, proper packaging and best delivery methods. Recent developments of formulation include entrapment/microencapsulation, nano-immobilization of microbial bioinoculants and biofilm-based biofertilizers. This review critically examines the current state-of-art on use of microbial strains as biofertilizers and the important roles performed by these beneficial microbes in maintaining soil fertility and enhancing crop productivity. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Because obesity is associated with diverse chronic diseases, little attention has been directed to the multiple beneficial functions of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue not only provides energy for growth, reproduction and immune function, but also secretes and receives diverse signaling molecules that coordinate energy allocation between these functions in response to ecological conditions. Importantly, many relevant ecological cues act on growth and physique, with adiposity responding as a counterbalancing risk management strategy. The large number of individual alleles associated with adipose tissue illustrates its integration with diverse metabolic pathways. However, phenotypic variation in age, sex, ethnicity and social status is further associated with different strategies for storing and using energy. Adiposity therefore represents a key means of phenotypic flexibility within and across generations, enabling a coherent life-history strategy in the face of ecological stochasticity. The sensitivity of numerous metabolic pathways to ecological cues makes our species vulnerable to manipulative globalized economic forces. The aim of this article is to understand how human adipose tissue biology interacts with modern environmental pressures to generate excess weight gain and obesity. The disease component of obesity might lie not in adipose tissue itself, but in its perturbation by our modern industrialized niche. Efforts to combat obesity could be more effective if they prioritized 'external' environmental change rather than attempting to manipulate 'internal' biology through pharmaceutical or behavioral means. © 2012.
