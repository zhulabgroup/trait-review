	abstract = {Background. Fire blight is a destructive disease of pome trees, caused by Erwinia amylovora, leading to high losses of chain-of-values fruits. Major outbreaks were registered between 2010 and 2017 in Portugal, and the first molecular epidemiological characterization of those isolates disclosed a clonal population with different levels of virulence and susceptibility to antimicrobial peptides. Methods. This work aimed to further disclose the genetic characterization and unveil the phenotypic diversity of this E. amylovora population, resorting to MLSA, growth kinetics, biochemical characterization, and antibiotic susceptibility. Results. While MLSA further confirmed the genetic clonality of those isolates, several phenotypic differences were recorded regarding their growth, carbon sources preferences, and chemical susceptibility to several antibiotics, disclosing a heterogeneous population. Principal component analysis regarding the phenotypic traits allows to separate the strains Ea 630 and Ea 680 from the remaining. Discussion. Regardless the genetic clonality of these E. amylovora strains isolated from fire blight outbreaks, the phenotypic characterization evidenced a population diversity beyond the genotype clonality inferred by MLSA and CRISPR, suggesting that distinct sources or environmental adaptations of this pathogen may have occurred. Conclusion. Attending the characteristic clonality of E. amylovora species, the data gathered here emphasizes the importance of phenotypic assessment of E. amylovora isolates to better understand their epidemiological behavior, namely by improving source tracking, make risk assessment analysis, and determine strain-specific environmental adaptations, that might ultimately lead to prevent new outbreaks. © Copyright 2022 Mendes et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Measuring mammals' bite force in laboratory conditions is not a simple task, let alone on wild medium-sized mammals in the field. Thus, morphometric-proxies are usually used to infer morphofunctional properties of musculoskeletal features. For instance, the study of bite force-indexes suggests that different capacities to crack food items reduce the competition between coexistent collared and white-lipped peccaries (Pecari tajacu and Tayassu pecari). The presence of exotic feral hogs (Sus scrofa) in peccaries' endemic areas gives rise to new ecological interactions between them. An example is the Brazilian Pantanal wetland, where ecomorphological mechanisms may play a role in their ecological relations. Taking this scenario as a case of study, we aimed to verify if the morphometric-proxies are de facto reliable tools, by comparing bite forces-indexes with the in vivo bite forces of these species. Methods. We captured 21 collared and white-lipped peccaries and feral hogs in the Brazilian Pantanal to assess their bite force at first molar. The Bite Force Measuring Tube (BiTu) is a robust and simple mechanical device designed to be used in field conditions. Only 11 individuals successfully bit the BiTu before being released. Their body measurements were compared and correlated with their bite force. The in vivo bite forces were compared with bite force-indexes of two papers based on independent morphometric methods and datasets: Sicuro & Oliveira (2002) used classic morphometrics to infer the bite forces of these three species in the Brazilian Pantanal, and Hendges et al. (2019) used geometric morphometrics to compare bite forces-indexes and feeding habits of the extant peccary species. The results of all species were standardized (Z-curves) according to each method. Doing so, we obtained comparable dimensionless comparable values but maintaining the differences between them. Results. The morphometric-proxies-based studies presented similar results: collared peccaries present weaker bites than white-lipped peccaries and feral hogs, while these two species presented no significant differences in their bite force-indexes. The in vivo bite force results suggest the same relations predicted by the morphometric models, including the high variation among the feral hogs. We found a significant correlation between the individuals' weight (kg) and their actual bite force (N) but no significant correlations with the head length. Conclusions. The BiTu proved to be a functional and low-cost tool to measure bite force in field conditions. The in vivo results presented a good correspondence with the predictions based on morphometric-proxies by Sicuro & Oliveira (2002) and Hendges et al. (2019). The results denote that these studies succeed in capturing the biomechanical signal of the three species' skull-jaw systems. This empirical validation confirms that these morphometric-proxies analyses are reliable methods to ecomorphological and evolutionary inferences. Copyright © 2021 Sicuro et al.},

	abstract = {Drought stress is a major issue impacting wheat growth and yield worldwide, and it is getting worse as the world’s climate changes. Thus, selection for drought-adaptive traits and drought-tolerant genotypes are essential components in wheat breeding programs. The goal of this study was to explore how spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) and yield traits in wheat genotypes changed in irrigated and water-limited environments. In two wheat-growing seasons, we evaluated 56 preselected wheat genotypes for SRIs, stay green (SG), canopy temperature depression (CTD), biological yield (BY), grain yield (GY), and yield contributing traits under control and drought stress, and the SRIs and yield traits exhibited higher heritability (H2) across the growing years. Diverse SRIs associated with SG, pigment content, hydration status, and aboveground biomass demonstrated a consistent response to drought and a strong association with GY. Under drought stress, GY had stronger phenotypic correlations with SG, CTD, and yield components than in control conditions. Three primary clusters emerged from the hierarchical cluster analysis, with cluster I (15 genotypes) showing minimal changes in SRIs and yield traits, indicating a relatively higher level of drought tolerance than clusters II (26 genotypes) and III (15 genotypes). The genotypes were appropriately assigned to distinct clusters, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) demonstrated that the clusters differed significantly. It was found that the top five components explained 73% of the variation in traits in the principal component analysis, and that vegetation and water-based indices, as well as yield traits, were the most important factors in explaining genotypic drought tolerance variation. Based on the current study’s findings, it can be concluded that proximal canopy reflectance sensing could be used to screen wheat genotypes for drought tolerance in water-starved environments.

	abstract = {The vertebrate stress response comprises a suite of behavioural and physiological traits that must be functionally integrated to ensure organisms cope adaptively with acute stressors. Natural selection should favour functional integration, leading to a prediction of genetic integration of these traits. Despite the implications of such genetic integration for our understanding of human and animal health, as well as evolutionary responses to natural and anthropogenic stressors, formal quantitative genetic tests of this prediction are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that acute stress response components in Trinidadian guppies are both heritable and integrated on the major axis of genetic covariation. This integration could either facilitate or constrain evolutionary responses to selection, depending upon the alignment of selection with this axis. Such integration also suggests artificial selection on the genetically correlated behavioural responses to stress could offer a viable non-invasive route to the improvement of health and welfare in captive animal populations. @ Houslay et al.},

	abstract = {Predictions of future biological invasions often rely on the assumption that introduced species establish only under climatic conditions similar to those in their native range. To date, 135 studies have tested this assumption of ‘niche conservatism’, yielding contradictory results. Here we revisit this literature, consider the evidence for niche shifts, critically assess the methods used, and discuss the authors’ interpretations of niche shifts. We find that the true frequency of niche shifts remains unknown because of diverging interpretations of similar metrics, conceptual issues biasing conclusions towards niche conservatism, and the use of climatic data that may not be biologically meaningful. We argue that these issues could be largely addressed by focussing on trends or relative degrees of niche change instead of dichotomous classifications (shift versus no shift), consistently and transparently including non-analogous climates, and conducting experimental studies on mismatches between macroclimates and microclimates experienced by the study organism. Furthermore, an observed niche shift may result either from species filling a greater part of their fundamental niche during the invasion (a ‘realised niche shift’) or from rapid evolution of traits adapting species to novel climates in the introduced range (a ‘fundamental niche shift’). Currently, there is no conclusive evidence distinguishing between these potential mechanisms of niche shifts. We outline how these questions may be addressed by combining computational analyses and experimental evidence. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The storage root crop cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is predicted to remain central to future food and economic security for smallholder farming households and agricultural output in the tropics. Genetic improvement of cassava is required to meet changing farmer and consumer needs, evolving pests and diseases, and challenges presented by climate change. Transgenic and genome editing technologies offer significant potential for introducing desired traits into farmer-preferred varieties and breeding lines, and for studying the biology of this under-investigated crop species. A bottleneck in implementing genetic modification in this species has been access to robust methods for transformation of cassava cultivars and landraces. In this article, we provide a detailed protocol for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of cassava and regeneration of genetically modified plants. Basic Protocol 1 describes how to establish and micropropagate in vitro cassava plantlets, and Alternate Protocol 1 details how to establish in vitro cultures from field or greenhouse cuttings. Basic Protocol 2 describes all steps necessary for genetic transformation in the model variety 60444, and Alternate Protocol 2 provides details for modifying this method for use with other cultivars. Finally, Basic Protocol 3 describes how to establish plants produced via Basic Protocol 2 and Alternate Protocol 2 in soil in a greenhouse. These methods have proven applications across more than a dozen genotypes and are capable of producing transgenic and gene-edited plants for experimental purposes, for testing under greenhouse and field conditions, and for development of plants suitable for subsequent regulatory approval and product deployment. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Invasive thrips, Thrips parvispinus Karny recently reported in India, causing a widespread severe infestation in more than 0.4 million ha of chilli (Capsicum annum L.) growing areas. This species is native to Thailand and most prevalent in other South East Asian countries. Large scale cultivation of the major host plants (chilli and papaya), and favourable climatic conditions in India and other countries similar to native range of Thrips parvispinus expected to favour its further spread and establishment to new areas. Materials and Methods: The present study was undertaken to confirm invasive thrips species identity through both morphological and molecular approaches and predict its potential invasion using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm. Results: The model predicted species range in respect of discrimination of suitable and unsuitable areas for its occurrence both in current and future climatic scenarios. The model provided a good fit for species distribution with a high value of area under the curve (0.957). The jackknife test indicated annual mean temperature and precipitation were found to be the most important bioclimatic variable in determining the distribution of T. parvispinus. High suitability areas were predicted in the countries wherever its occurrence was reported with high discrimination ability of suitable and unsuitable areas. Key distinguishing morphological characters of T. parvispinus were illustrated through high-resolution scanning electron microscopic images. Conclusion: The identity of the thrips causing wide spread damage in chilli confirmed through morphological and molecular approaches. Key identifying characters were described through high resolution scanning electron microscopic images for accurate identification of the species. MaxEnt model identified high suitability regions for the potential establishment of T. parvispinus in India and other parts of the world. This study facilitates forecasting of further spread and also suggests imposing strict domestic quarantine measures to curtail its establishment in the new areas. Copyright 2022 Hn et al.},

	abstract = {AU Movement: Pleaseconfirmthatallheadinglevelsarerepresentedcorrectly is critical to animal survival and, thus, biodiversity: in fragmented landscapes. Increasing fragmentation in the Anthropocene necessitates predictions about the movement capacities of the multitude of species that inhabit natural ecosystems. This requires mechanistic, trait-based animal locomotion models, which are sufficiently general as well as biologically realistic. While larger animals should generally be able to travel greater distances, reported trends in their maximum speeds across a range of body sizes suggest limited movement capacities among the largest species. Here, we show that this also applies to travel speeds and that this arises because of their limited heat-dissipation capacities. We derive a model considering how fundamental biophysical constraints of animal body mass associated with energy utilisation (i.e., larger animals have a lower metabolic energy cost of locomotion) and heat-dissipation (i.e., larger animals require more time to dissipate metabolic heat) limit aerobic travel speeds. Using an extensive empirical dataset of animal travel speeds (532 species), we show that this allometric heat-dissipation model best captures the hump-shaped trends in travel speed with body mass for flying, running, and swimming animals. This implies that the inability to dissipate metabolic heat leads to the saturation and eventual decrease in travel speed with increasing body mass as larger animals must reduce their realised travel speeds in order to avoid hyperthermia during extended locomotion bouts. As a result, the highest travel speeds are achieved by animals of intermediate body mass, suggesting that the largest species are more limited in their movement capacities than previously anticipated. Consequently, we provide a mechanistic understanding of animal travel speed that can be generalised across species, even when the details of an individual species' biology are unknown, to facilitate more realistic predictions of biodiversity dynamics in fragmented landscapes.

	abstract = {Avian pathogenic E. coli is the causative agent of extra-intestinal infections in birds known as colibacillosis, which can manifest as localized or systemic infections. The disease affects all stages of poultry production, resulting in economic losses that occur due to morbidity, carcass condemnation and increased mortality of the birds. APEC strains have a diverse virulence trait repertoire, which includes virulence factors involved in adherence to and invasion of the host cells, serum resistance factors, and toxins. However, the pathogenesis of APEC infections remains to be fully elucidated. The Type 6 secretion (T6SS) system has recently gained attention due to its role in the infection process and protection of bacteria from host defenses in human and animal pathogens. Previous work has shown that T6SS components are involved in the adherence to and invasion of host cells, as well as in the formation of biofilm, and intramacrophage bacterial replication. Here, we analyzed the frequency of T6SS genes hcp, impK, evpB, vasK and icmF in a collection of APEC strains and their potential role in virulence-associated phenotypes of APECO18. The T6SS genes were found to be significantly more prevalent in APEC than in fecal E. coli isolates from healthy birds. Expression of T6SS genes was analyzed in culture media and upon contact with host cells. Mutants were generated for hcp, impK, evpB, and icmF and characterized for their impact on virulence-associated phenotypes, including adherence to and invasion of host model cells, and resistance to predation by Dictyostelium discoideum. Deletion of the aforementioned genes did not significantly affect adherence and invasion capabilities of APECO18. Deletion of hcp reduced resistance of APECO18 to predation by D. discoideum, suggesting that T6SS is involved in the virulence of APECO18.  Copyright © 2021 de Oliveira et al.},

	abstract = {Reliable identification of species is important for protecting native ecosystems against the invasion of non-native species. DNA barcoding using molecular markers, such as the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, helps researchers distinguish species. In this study, we focused on introduced veronicellid slugs in the Ryukyu Islands and some greenhouses on mainland Japan. Some veronicellids are medium-to-high risk pest species for humans. Identifying veronicellid species by their external morphology is difficult and unreliable because there is substantial overlap between intraspecific variation and interspecific differentiation. Therefore, internal morphologies such as male genitalia have been the primary traits used to distinguish veronicellids. To identify introduced veronicellid slugs in Japan to the species level, we used morphological assessment of male genitalia and DNA barcoding of the standard COI gene fragment. We also conducted species-delimitation analyses based on the genetic data. The results showed that five evolutionarily significant units, corresponding to four nominal species inhabit the Ryukyu Islands, of which two species were also found in the greenhouses of mainland Japan, including the first record of Sarasinula plebeia in Japan.

	abstract = {Reynoutria japonica (Japanese knotweed) is a problematic invasive plant found in many areas of Europe and North America. Notably, in the UK, the species can cause issues with mortgage acquisition. Control of R. japonica is complicated by its ability to regenerate from small fragments of plant material; however, there remains uncertainty about how much (in terms of mass) rhizome is required for successful regeneration. This study investigated the ability of crowns and rhizomes with different numbers of nodes to regenerate successfully from three sites in the north of England, UK. Two of the sites had been subject to herbicide treatment for two years prior to sampling and the third site had no history of herbicide treatment. No significant differences were observed in regenerated stem diameter, maximum height of stem and maximum growth increments among crowns. All traits measured from the planted crowns were significantly greater than those of the planted rhizome fragments and at least one node was necessary for successful regeneration of rhizomes. The smallest initial fragment weight to regenerate and survive the experiment was 0.5 g. Subjecting all plant material to desiccation for 38 days resulted in no regrowth (emergence or regeneration) after replanting. These findings suggest that desiccation could be a valuable management strategy for small to medium scale infestations common in urban settings. Copyright © 2021 Lawson et al.},

	abstract = {Arable land polluted by copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) is a widespread problem. The use of biochar and/or clay mineral as a soil amendment can effectively solidify heavy metals in the soil. We applied biochar (BC), iron modified biochar (Fe-BC), maifanite (MF, a kind of clay minerals), a combination of BC with MF (BC:MF), and Fe-BC with MF (Fe-BC:MF) at a 2 wt % dose as soil amendments to study their ability to prevent Cu and Cd from accumulating in ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). We found that after 90 days of cultivation, the Cd and Cu content both significantly decreased in ryegrass shoots from 2.06 and 209.3 mg kg-1 (control) to 1.44-2.01 and 51.50-70.92 mg kg-1, respectively, across treatments (p < 0.05). Similarly, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) for Cd/Cu was significantly smaller (P < 0.05) in all amendments versus control soil. This trend differed among the shoot, BCF, and transportation factor (TF). Combining BC:MF or Fe-BC:MF did not significantly improve the Cd/Cu stabilization in the soil compared to the corresponding single amendment (p > 0.05). Our adsorption balance experiment showed that BC, Fe-BC, and MF physically and chemically adsorbed Cd and Cu by complexation with functional groups (mesoporous nanomaterials) whose porosity measurements ranged from 0.68 to 78.57 m2 g-1. Furthermore, the amorphous crystalline iron oxide binding Cd and Cu was the key to immobilizing these metals in the soil. The amendments applied in our study show promise for enhancing immobilization of Cu and Cd in contaminated paddy soils. Copyright © 2021 Ding et al.},

	abstract = {Global change has dramatic impacts on grassland diversity. However, little is known about how fast species can adapt to diversity loss and how this affects their responses to global change. Here, we performed a common garden experiment testing whether plant responses to global change are influenced by their selection history and the conditioning history of soil at different plant diversity levels. Using seeds of four grass species and soil samples from a 14-year old biodiversity experiment, we grew the offspring of the plants either in their own soil or in soil of a different community, and exposed them either to drought, increased nitrogen input, or a combination of both. Under nitrogen addition, offspring of plants selected at high diversity produced more biomass than those selected at low diversity, while drought neutralized differences in biomass production. Moreover, under the influence of global change drivers, soil history, and to a lesser extent plant history, had species-specific effects on trait expression. Our results show that plant diversity modulates plant-soil interactions and growth strategies of plants, which in turn affects plant eco-evolutionary pathways. How this change affects species' response to global change and whether this can cause a feedback loop should be investigated in more detail in future studies. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Jolkinolide B (JB), a diterpenoid compound isolated from the roots of Euphorbia fischeriana, has gained research attention for its antitumor effects. In recent years, JB reportedly displayed anti-tumor activity in solid tumors, such as breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer, and leukemia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of JB on HeLa cells with a focus on cell growth inhibition and related mechanisms. HeLa cells were cultured in vitro and divided into a blank control group, HeLa-Scramble (0, 0.25, 0.5 mM), and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homolog (WASH) protein silenced group, HeLa-shWASH (0, 0.25, 0.5 mM). Morphological changes were observed using an inverted microscope. The inhibition rate of cell proliferation was detected using the WST-1 method. Flow cytometry Brdu+PI double standard method was used to detect cell replication ability and FITC+PI double standard method was used to detect cell apoptosis rate. Western blot was used to verify the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, WASH, Bax, Bcl-2, and PCNA. The mRNA expression of cytokines (IL-1a, IL-6, and IL-8) was detected using RT-qPCR. The results showed that JB induced cell apoptosis and arrested cells at the G2/M phase in HeLa-shWASH cells compared with HeLa-Scramble cells (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). In addition, JB upregulated IL-1a, IL-6, and IL-8 in HeLa-shWASH cells. We conclude that WASH protein participates in JB-induced regulation of the Nrf2/ ARE pathway, aggravates inflammatory responses, and promotes cancer cell apoptosis, thus inhibiting the proliferation and invasion abilities of HeLa cells. JB may have anti-tumor effects and potential clinical value for the treatment of cervical cancer. Copyright 2022 Hong et al.},

	abstract = {Background: The subtropical dune thicket (hereafter “dune thicket”) of the Cape Floristic Region experiences a wide range of fire exposure throughout the landscape, unlike other dry rainforest formations that rarely experience fire. We sought to determine how fire exposure influences species composition and the architectural composition of dune thicket. Methods: We used multivariate analysis and diversity indices based on cover abundance of species to describe the species composition, architectural guild composition and structure of dune thicket sites subject to different levels of fire exposure, namely low (fire return interval of >100 years), moderate (fire return interval of 50-100 years), and high (fire return interval of 10-50 years). Results: The diversity, cover abundance and architectural guild cover abundance of dune thicket canopy species were strongly influenced by the level of fire exposure such that each level was associated with a well-circumscribed vegetation unit. Dune thickets subject to low fire exposure comprises a floristically distinct, low forest characterized by shrubs with one-to-few upright stems (ca. 4-8 m tall) and a relatively small canopy spread (vertical growers). Of the 25 species in this unit, 40% were restricted to it. Dune thickets subject to moderate fire exposure had the highest abundance of lateral spreaders, which are multi-stemmed (ca. 3-6 m tall) species with a large canopy spread and lower stature than vertical growers. None of the 17 species found in this unit was restricted to it. Dune thickets subject to high fire exposure had the highest abundance of hedge-forming shrubs, these being low shrubs (ca. 0.6-1.4 m tall), with numerous shoots arising from an extensive system of below-ground stems. Of the 20 species in this unit, 40% were restricted to it. Multivariate analysis identified three floristic units corresponding to the three fire exposure regimes. Compositional structure, in terms of species and architectural guilds, was most distinctive for dune thickets subject to high and low fire exposure, while the dune thicket subject to moderate fire exposure showed greatest compositional overlap with the other units. Conclusion: Fire exposure profoundly influenced the composition and structure of dune thicket canopy species in the Cape Floristic Region. In the prolonged absence of fire, the thicket is invaded by vertical-growing species that overtop and outcompete the multi-stemmed, laterally-spreading shrubs that dominate this community. Regular exposure to fire selects for traits that enable thicket species to rapidly compete for canopy cover post-fire via the prolific production of resprouts from basal buds below- and above-ground. The trade-off is that plant height is constrained, as proportionately more resources are allocated to below-ground biomass. Copyright © 2022 Strydom et al.},

The study of ant-plant networks has increased our knowledge of the diversity of interactions and structure of these communities; however, little is known about how land-use change affects ant-plant networks. Here we determine whether the change in land use, from native oak forest to induced grassland, affected the network properties of ant-plant networks in a temperate forest in Mexico. We hypothesize that the disturbed vegetation will be more nested and generalized due to the addition of generalist species to the network. The oak forest network comprises 47 plant species and 11 ant species, while the induced grassland network has 35 and 13, respectively. Floral nectar was the resource used most intensely by the ants in both vegetation types. The ant-plant network of the induced grassland was significantly more nested and generalist than that of the oak forest; however, none of the networks were nested when considering the frequency of interaction. In both vegetation types, the ants were more specialized than the plants, and niche overlap was low. This could be related to the dominant species present in each type of vegetation: Prenolepis imparis in the oak forest and Camponotus rubrithorax in the grassland. The central core of cold climate ant species in the oak forest was replaced by a central core of subordinate Camponotini and tropical specialists in the induced grassland. These results suggest that the increase in nestedness and generalization in the grassland may be related to the loss of the cold climate specialists from the core of the oak forest network. Our findings provide evidence that land-use change increases the level of generalization in the ant-plant interaction networks of temperate forests. Copyright 2022 Cuautle et al.},

	abstract = {Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) possesses a high level of nutritional quality and is widely used as a forage species to establish permanent pastures in southern Chile. However, the productivity of most such pastures is limited by various environmental agents, such as insect pests and drought. In this context, our work stresses the need for elucidating the ability of fungal endophytes to establish interactions with plants, and to understand how these processes contribute to plant performance and fitness. Therefore, we evaluated the colonization and impact of two native strains of the endophytic insect-pathogenic fungus (EIPF) group isolated from permanent ryegrass pastures in southern Chile. Roots and seeds of ryegrass and scarabaeid larvae were collected from nine different ryegrass pastures in the Los Ríos region of southern Chile to specifically isolate EIPFs belonging to the genera Beauveria and Metarhizium. Fungal isolations were made on 2% water agar with antibiotics, and strains were identified by analyzing the entire internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA region. Four strains of Beauveria and 33 strains of Metarhizium were isolated only in scarabaeid larvae from ryegrass pastures across four sites. Experimental mini-pastures that were either not inoculated (control) or co-inoculated with conidia of the strains Beauveria vermiconia NRRL B- 67993 (P55_1) and Metarhizium aff. lepidiotae NRRL B-67994 (M25_2) under two soil humidity levels were used. Ryegrass plants were randomly collected from the mini-pastures to characterize EIPF colonization in the roots by real-time PCR and fluorescence microscopy. Aboveground biomass was measured to analyze the putative impact of colonization on the mini-pastures' aboveground phenotypic traits with R software using a linear mixed-effects model and the ANOVA statistical test. Seasonal variation in the relative abundance of EIPFs was observed, which was similar between both strains from autumn to spring, but different in summer. In summer, the relative abundance of both EIPFs decreased under normal moisture conditions, but it did not differ significantly under water stress. The aboveground biomass of ryegrass also increased from autumn to spring and decreased in summer in both the inoculated and control mini-pastures. Although differences were observed between moisture levels, they were not significant between the control and inoculated mini-pastures, except in July (fresh weight and leaf area) and October (dry weight). Our findings indicate that native strains of B. vermiconia NRRL B-67993 (P55_1) and M. aff. lepidiotae NRRL B-67994 (M25_2) colonize and co-exist in the roots of ryegrass, and these had little or no effect on the mini-pastures' aboveground biomass; however, they could have other functions, such as protection against root herbivory by insect pests.  © 2022 Vera et al.},

	abstract = {Fire and herbivores are two important drivers of changes in vegetation composition, quality and dynamics and both are highly related to each other. Herbivores are known to respond to fire both in terms of foraging decisions and distribution. However, little is known about the actual changes in plant chemistry following a fire event and how long these changes will last. We investigated the effect of fire on two different plant functional groups (grasses and woody species) in a woodland savanna of southern Africa. We studied chemical compounds known to be important for palatability of five perennial grass and seven woody species (trees and shrubs) common in the woodland savanna and known to be utilized by herbivores. We wanted to know if plant chemistry differs between a recently burned site (burned 2 years ago) and a control site, burned 16 years ago, and if grasses and woody species show similar relative differences between sites (i.e., the plants' response to fire). We found a clear difference in chemical composition patterns between the plant functional groups, with an almost homogenous response to fire among woody species, but higher variability in response among grass species. Furthermore, we found that woody species maintained a higher nutritional value even 2 years after burning, whereas grasses did not show clear differences among the two investigated sites. Hence, few years after burning, woody plants might still serve as an attraction for herbivores, especially browsers, in contrast to grasses. The knowledge about these differences between the two functional groups in response to fire is beneficial for the development of management strategies for large herbivores whether domestic or wild. © 2022 PeerJ Inc..

	abstract = {Structural and physiological changes in the female reproductive system underlie the origins of pregnancy in multiple vertebrate lineages. In mammals, the glandular portion of the lower reproductive tract has transformed into a structure specialized for supporting fetal development. These specializations range from relatively simple maternal nutrient provisioning in egg-laying monotremes to an elaborate suite of traits that support intimate maternal-fetal interactions in Euthe-rians. Among these traits are the maternal decidua and fetal component of the placenta, but there is considerable uncertainty about how these structures evolved. Previously, we showed that changes in uterine gene expression contributes to several evolutionary innovations during the origins of pregnancy (Mika et al., 2021b). Here, we reconstruct the evolution of entire transcriptomes (‘ances-tral transcriptome reconstruction’) and show that maternal gene expression profiles are correlated with degree of placental invasion. These results indicate that an epitheliochorial-like placenta evolved early in the mammalian stem-lineage and that the ancestor of Eutherians had a hemochorial placenta, and suggest maternal control of placental invasiveness. These data resolve major transitions in the evolution of pregnancy and indicate that ancestral transcriptome reconstruction can be used to study the function of ancestral cell, tissue, and organ systems. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Centaurea scabiosa L. and C. stoebe Tausch are known to co-exist naturally in two extremely different types of open dry habitats in the temperate zone, alkaline xerothermic grasslands and acidic dry grasslands. However, knowledge about their preferences to edaphic conditions, including soil acidity (pH), and iron (Fe) availability is scarce. Therefore, experimental comparison of soil requirements (acidic Podzol vs alkaline Rendzina) of these species was carried out. The study was designed as a pot experiment and conducted under field conditions. Fe availability was increased by application of Fe-HBED. Reactions of plants to edaphic conditions were determined using growth measurements, leaf morphometric measurements, chlorosis scoring, chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a fluorescence (OJIP) quantification as well as determination of element content (Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu). Growth and leaf morphometrical traits of the studied congeneric species were affected similarly by the soil type and differently by the chelate treatment. Increased availability of Fe in Rendzina contrasted the species, as treatment with 25 µmol Fe-HBED kg−1 soil promoted growth only in C. stoebe. Both species turned out to be resistant to Fe-dependent chlorosis which was also reflected in only minor changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters. Both species showed relatively low nutritional demands. Surprisingly, Fe-HBED did not stimulate Fe acquisition in the studied species, nor its translocation along the root:shoot axis. Furthermore, contrary to expectations, C. scabiosa took up less Fe from the acidic than alkaline soil. C. scabiosa not only absorbed more Ca and Zn but also translocated greater amounts of these elements to shoots than C. stoebe. Both species acquired more Mg on Podzol than on Rendzina which suggests adaptation allowing avoidance of aluminum (Al) toxicity on acidic soils. Overall, it seems that C. scabiosa prefers alkaline soils, whilst C. stoebe prefers acidic ones. © Copyright 2021 Wala et al.},

	abstract = {Sunflower is an important oilseed crop across the world. It is considered as a moderately drought tolerant plant, however, its yield is still negatively affected by drought stress. Improving drought tolerance is of the outmost important for breeding. Although several studies have documented the relationship between the sunflower phenotype and genotype under drought stress, but relatively few studies have simultaneously investigated the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in the sunflower at different growth stages. In this study, we conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for different sunflower traits during the germination and seedling stages. Eighteen phenotypic traits were evaluated under well-watered and drought stress conditions. We determined that the germination rate, germination potential, germination index, and root-to-shoot ratio can be used as effective indexes for drought tolerance selection and breeding. A total of 33 QTLs were identified on eight chromosomes (PVE: 0.016%–10.712% with LOD: 2.017–7.439). Within the confidence interval of the QTL, we identified 60 putative drought-related genes. Four genes located on chromosome 13 may function in both germination and seedling stages for drought response. Genes LOC110898128, LOC110898092, LOC110898071, and LOC110898072 were annotated as aquaporin SIP1-2-like, cytochrome P450 94C1, GABA transporter 1-like, and GABA transporter 1-like isoform X2, respectively. These genes will be used for further functional validation. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of the sunflower’s in response to drought stress. At the same time, it lays a foundation for sunflower drought tolerance breeding and genetic improvement. © 2023 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {For millennia, societies have tried to find ways to sustain people’s livelihoods by setting rules to equitably and sustainably access, harvest and manage common pools of resources (CPR) that are productive and rich in species. But what are the elements that explain historical successes and failures? Elinor Ostrom suggested that it depends on at least eight axiomatic principles of good governance, whereas empirical results suggest that these principles are not sufficient to describe them, especially when applied to CPRs that possess great social and ecological diversity. The aim of this article is to explore the behavior of a mathematical model of multi-species forest dynamics that respects the foundations of ecology and Ostrom’s governance theory, in order to detect possible constraints inherent to the functioning of these complex systems. The model reveals that fundamental structural laws of compatibilities between species life-history traits are indeed constraining the level of co-existence (average and variance) between a diversity of co-vulnerable timber resource users (RU) and of competing tree species. These structural constraints can also lead to unexpected outcomes. For instance in wetter forest commons, opening up the access to as many diverse RUs as there are competing tree species, produces a diversity of independently-controlled disturbances on species, collectively improving the chances of coexistence between species with different life-history traits. Similar benefits are observed on forest carbon and on profits from timber harvesting. However in drier forest commons, the same benefits cannot be observed, as predicted on the basis of the constraining laws. The results show that the successes and failures of certain management strategies can be reasonably explained by simple mechanistic theories from ecology and the social-ecological sciences, which are themselves constrained by fundamental ecological invariants. If corroborated, the results could be used, in conjunction with Ostrom’s CPR theory, to understand and solve various human-nature coexistence dilemmas in complex social-ecological systems.

	abstract = {Medicago polymorpha L. (bur clover), an invasive plant species of the genus Medicago, has been traditionally used in China as an edible vegetable crop because of its high nutritive value. However, few molecular markers for M. polymorpha have been identified. Using the recently published high-quality reference genome of M. polymorpha, we performed a specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) analysis of 10 M. polymorpha accessions to identify molecular markers and explore genetic diversity. A total of 52,237 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were developed. These SNPs were mostly distributed on pseudochromosome 3, least distributed on pseudochromosome 7, and relatively evenly distributed on five other pseudochromosomes of M. polymorpha. Phenotypic analysis showed that there was a great difference in phenotypic traits among different M. polymorpha accessions. Moreover, clustering all M. polymorpha accessions based on their phenotypic traits revealed three groups. Both phylogenetic analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) of all M. polymorpha accessions based on SNP markers consistently indicated that all M. polymorpha accessions could be divided into three distinct groups (I, II, and III). Subsequent genetic diversity analysis for the 10 M. polymorpha accessions validated the effectiveness of the M. polymorpha germplasm molecular markers in China. Additionally, SSR mining analysis was also performed to identify polymorphic SSR motifs, which could provide valuable candidate markers for the further breeding of M. polymorpha. Since M. polymorpha genetics have not been actively studied, the molecular markers generated from our research will be useful for further research on M. polymorpha resource utilization and marker-assisted breeding.

	abstract = {We examined the distribution patterns of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera functional feeding groups (EPT FFGs) in five streams that drain semi-urban landscapes in the Tsitsa River catchment, Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. We undertook macroinvertebrate and physicochemical analysis over four seasons between 2016 and 2017 at eight sites in three land-use categories (Sites 1, 2 and 3), representing an increasing gradient of semi-urban pollution. Five EPT FFGs (shredders, grazers/scrapers, predators, collector-gatherers and collector-filterers) were fuzzy coded and analyzed using RLQ-R (environmental characteristics of samples), L (taxa distribution across samples) and Q (species traits) and fourth-corner analyses. Physicochemical variables, including phosphate-phosphorus, total inorganic nitrogen and temperature, were the most influential variables that significantly influenced the distribution patterns of EPT FFGs in the Tsitsa River. RLQ and the fourth-corner model revealed varying responses of FFGs to semi-urban pollution. Of the five FFGs, collectors were the most abundant EPT FFGs in the study area, exhibiting disparate responses to disturbances, with collector-gatherers associated with impacted sites and significantly associated with phosphate-phosphorus. On the other hand, collector-filterers decreased with increasing semi-urban disturbance and exhibited a significant negative association with phosphate-phosphorus, total inorganic nitrogen and temperature. Overall, this study provides further insights into the environmental factors that influence the distribution patterns of FFGs in Afrotropical streams and the potential use of FFGs as indicators of anthropogenic pollution in tropical streams and rivers. © Copyright 2022 Akamagwuna et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Cotton is an economically important crop in China, and drought has seriously affected cotton production. Understanding genetic variation, genotype ×environment interactions, and the associations between these traits is critical for developing improved cotton varieties with high drought tolerance. Methods. To screen ideal drought-resistant cotton germplasm lines and excellent genotypes, the yield traits of 103 cotton germplasm lines were analyzed. Cotton resource material was planted under normal watering and water deficit conditions for three consecutive years. The yield traits under normal irrigation and water stress conditions were measured, and then five screening indicators were calculated based on the cotton yield per plant under the two water treatments to determine the ideal genotype and most accurate identification indicators. Results. The results of correlation analysis and principal component analysis showed that the geometric mean productivity (GMP), mean productivity (MP), and stress tolerance index (STI) were significantly positively correlated with yield under water stress and could be used to distinguish genotypes with high drought tolerance. Among the experimental germplasm lines, some had higher STI and GMP values, indicating their higher drought tolerance. This result indicates that best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) analysis of the STI and GMP under drought stress can effectively improve screening for drought tolerance in cotton germplasm lines. The results from the screening index, three-dimensional map, and genotype ×environment (GGE) biplots were consistent with the above results. We determined that CQJ-5, Xin lu zao 45, Bellsno, Zhong R 2016 and ND 359-5 are drought-tolerant genotypes that can be used to breed drought-tolerant germplasm lines that produce high and stable yields. © Copyright 2023 Sun et al.},

	abstract = {Unusually low temperatures caused by global climate change adversely affect rice production. Sensing cold to trigger signal network is a key base for improvement of chilling tolerance trait. Here, we report that Oryza sativa Calreticulin 3 (OsCRT3) localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exhibits conformational changes under cold stress, thereby enhancing its interaction with CBL-interacting protein kinase 7 (OsCIPK7) to sense cold. Phenotypic analyses of OsCRT3 knock-out mutants and transgenic overexpression lines demonstrate that OsCRT3 is a positive regulator in chilling tolerance. OsCRT3 localizes at the ER and mediates increases in cytosolic calcium levels under cold stress. Notably, cold stress triggers secondary structural changes of OsCRT3 and enhances its binding affinity with OsCIPK7, which finally boosts its kinase activity. Moreover, Calcineurin B-like protein 7 (OsCBL7) and OsCBL8 interact with OsCIPK7 specifically on the plasma membrane. Taken together, our results thus identify a cold-sensing mechanism that simultaneously conveys cold-induced protein conformational change, enhances kinase activity, and Ca2+ signal generation to facilitate chilling tolerance in rice. ©2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Broomcorn millet, a C4 cereal, has better tolerance to environmental stresses. Although elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration has led to grain nutrition reduction in most staple crops, studies evaluating its effects on broomcorn millet are still scarce. The yield, nutritional quality and metabolites of broomcorn millet were investigated under ambient CO2 (aCO2, 400 µmol mol–1) and elevated CO2 (eCO2, aCO2+ 200 µmol mol–1) for three years using open-top chambers (OTC). The results showed that the yield of broomcorn millet was markedly increased under eCO2 compared with aCO2. On average, eCO2 significantly increased the concentration of Mg (27.3%), Mn (14.6%), and B (21.2%) over three years, whereas it did not affect the concentration of P, K, Fe, Ca, Cu or Zn. Protein content was significantly decreased, whereas starch and oil concentrations were not changed by eCO2. With the greater increase in grain yield, eCO2 induced increase in the grain accumulations of P (23.87%), K (29.5%), Mn (40.08%), Ca (22.58%), Mg (51.31%), Zn (40.95%), B (48.54%), starch (16.96%) and oil (28.37%) on average for three years. Flavonoids such as kaempferol, apigenin, eriodictyol, luteolin, and chrysoeriol were accumulated under eCO2. The reduction in L-glutamine and L-lysine metabolites, which were the most representative amino acid in grain proteins, led to a reduction of protein concentration under eCO2. Broomcorn millet has more desirable nutritional traits for combating hidden hunger. This may potentially be useful for breeding more nutritious plants in the era of climate change.

The same zoonotic pathogens that cause severe infections in a human host frequently fail to produce any disease outcome in their natural hosts. What precise features of the immune system enable natural reservoirs to carry these pathogens so efficiently? To understand these effects, we highlight the importance of tracing the evolutionary basis of pathogen tolerance in reservoir hosts, while drawing implications from their diverse physiological and life-history traits, and ecological contexts of host-pathogen interactions. Long-term co-evolution might allow reservoir hosts to modulate immunity and evolve tolerance to zoonotic pathogens, increasing their circulation and infectious period. Such processes can also create a genetically diverse pathogen pool by allowing more mutations and genetic exchanges between circulating strains, thereby harboring rare alive-on-arrival variants with extended infectivity to new hosts (i.e., spillover). Finally, we end by underscoring the indispensability of a large multidis-ciplinary empirical framework to explore the proposed link between evolved tolerance, pathogen prevalence, and spillover in the wild. ‍© Seal et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Stephadiscus lyratus (Couthouy in Gould, 1846), an endemic Charopidae from southern South America, was described from few dry shells. The distribution of this species is known on scattering occurrences, mainly from material deposited in museum collections. We provide here new information on anatomy, habitat, and microhabitat preferences and estimate the potential geographic distribution of the species to test if it is exclusively endemic to the Subpolar Magellanic Forest. Methods: Fieldwork was carried out in the National Parks of the Patagonian Forests. Snails were photographed, measured, and dissected for anatomical studies; shells were studied with scanning electron microscopy. Estimation of the species geographical distribution (EGD) was obtained through correlative ecological niche modeling (ENM). We designed a calibration area a priori with known species points of occurrence in the Magellanic Subpolar Forests and borders of the Patagonian steppe. Seven bioclimatic variables of the WorldClim database were used. The best ENMs were calibrated and selected using a maximum entropy method with Maxent v3.3.3K through the R package "kuenm". Candidate models were created by combining four values of regularization multiplier and all possible combinations of three feature classes. We evaluated candidate model performance based on significance (partial ROC), omission rates (E = 5%), and model complexity (AICc). From the best models obtained, a final model was transferred to a region "G" consisting of the calibration area plus the Valdivian Temperate Forests and whole Patagonian steppe, where we hypothesize that the species could be present. Finally, we obtained binary presence-Absence maps. We quantified the proportion of the occurrence points and distribution range of S. lyratus in different land cover categories. To explore the degree of protection of S. lyratus EGD, we quantified the proportion of its distributional range within protected areas. Results: A be-lobed kidney, a close secondary ureter, the terminal portion of the uterus forming a compact glandular mass, and the vas deferens with a dilatation are new anatomical information that distinguishes this species. Stephadiscus lyratus inhabit cold native forest areas, mainly living on or under humid logs in contact with the ground. The main constraining variables to explain S. lyratus distribution in the EGD were BIO3, BIO12, BIO6, and BIO4. The potential area of distribution obtained almost duplicates their original range (140,454 km2) extending to the Valdivian Temperate forests mainly in Chile. Natural and semi-natural terrestrial vegetation was predominant in the potential area of distribution of S. lyratus. However, only 14.7% of this area occurs within current protected areas from Argentina and Chile. The ectothermic physiological traits of this species, low dispersal capacity, and its narrow habitat requirements turn S. lyratus into a potentially vulnerable species. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

Climate change is altering abiotic seasonality (e.g., longer summers) and in turn, phenological patterns contained within. However, how phenology should evolve is still an unsolved problem. This problem lies at the crux of predicting future phenological changes that will likely have substantial ecosystem consequences, and more fundamentally, of understanding an undeniably global phenomenon. Most studies have associated proximate environmental variables with phenological responses in case-specific ways, making it difficult to contextualize observations within a general evolutionary framework. We outline the complex but universal ways in which seasonal timing maps onto evolutionary fitness. We borrow lessons from life history theory and evolutionary demography that have benefited from a first principles-based theoretical scaffold. Lastly, we identify key questions for theorists and empiricists to help advance our general understanding of phenology. © 2022 Park, Post.

	abstract = {In June 2017, extreme fires along the southern Cape coast of South Africa burnt native fynbos and thicket vegetation and caused extensive damage to plantations and residential properties. Invasive alien plants (IAPs) occur commonly in the area and were thought to have changed the behaviour of these fires through their modification of fuel properties relative to that of native vegetation. This study experimentally compared various measures of flammability across groups of native and alien invasive shrub species in relation to their fuel traits. Live plant shoots of 30 species (10 species each of native fynbos, native thicket, and IAPs) were sampled to measure live fuel moisture, dry biomass, fuel bed porosity and the proportions of fine-, coarse- and dead fuels. These shoots were burnt experimentally, and flammability measured in terms of maximum temperature (combustibility), completeness of burn (consumability), and time-to-ignition (ignitability). Multiple regression models were used to assess the relationships between flammability responses and fuel traits, while the Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to establish if differences existed in flammability measures and fuel traits among the vegetation groups. Dry biomass significantly enhanced, while live fuel moisture significantly reduced, maximum temperature, whereas the proportion of fine fuels significantly increased completeness of burn. Unlike other similar studies, the proportion of dead fuels and fuel bed porosity were not retained by any of the models to account for variation in flammability. Species of fynbos and IAPs generally exhibited greater flammability in the form of higher completeness of burn and more rapid ignition than species of thicket. Little distinction in flammability and fuel traits could be made between species of fynbos and IAPs, except that fynbos species had a greater proportion of fine fuels. Thicket species had higher proportions of coarse fuels and greater dry biomass (~fuel loading) than species of fynbos and IAPs. Live fuel moisture did not differ among the vegetation groups, contrary to the literature often ascribing variation in flammability to fuel moisture differences. The fuel traits investigated only explained 21–53% of the variation in flammability and large variation was evident among species within vegetation groups suggesting that species-specific and in situ community-level investigations are warranted, particularly in regard fuel moisture and chemical contents.

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies have shown that Crambe abyssinica and Raphanus sativus are physiologically tolerant to water deficits; however, there is a lack of information on the mechanisms responsible for their tolerance regarding root morphological characteristics. This study aimed to characterize morphological changes in the root system of C. abyssinica and R. sativus subjected water deficit, as well as to identify the responses that improve tolerance and post-stress recovery capacity of these plants. Methods: Independent experiments for each specieswere performed in a controlled greenhouse, where plants were randomly set in a randomized block design with five replicates. Plants of C. abyssinica and R. sativus were cultivated in pots and exposed to well-watered treatment (WW; 90% water holding capacity-WHC of the substrate) or water deficit (WD; 40% WHC) conditions, at 28 days after planting. The plants were kept underWDfor 7, 14, or 21 days with rehydration soon after each episode of water deficit. Assessment of water relations, biomass allocation, leaf and root system morphological characteristics and gas exchange were performed after each period of water deficit and 48 h after rehydration. Results: The water deficit reduced the water status of both species, and morphological and biomass allocation were not recovered after rehydration. Photosynthesis of C. abyssinica decreased with prolonged water deficit, which was also not recovered after rehydration. In R. sativus, photosynthesis was not altered by WD for 21 days, and a higher WUE was recorded. Root morphology of R. sativus was mainly affected at 14 days of WD, while the traits related to very fine roots increased at 21 days of WD, when compared to WW plants. Thus, R. sativus has shown greater tolerance to water deficits mainly due to the presence of very fine roots throughout the period of stress, when compared to C. abyssinica in which the fine roots predominated. © 2022 PeerJ Inc..

	abstract = {Drier climates impose environmental stresses on plant communities that may result in community reassembly and threatened ecosystem services, but also may trigger self-organization in spatial patterns of biota and resources, which act to relax these stresses. The complex relationships between these counteracting processes – community reassembly and spatial self-organization – have hardly been studied. Using a spatio-temporal model of dryland plant communities and a trait-based approach, we study the response of such communities to imposed water stress of increasing degrees. We first show that spatial patterning acts to reverse shifts from fast-growing species to stress-tolerant species, as well as to reverse functional-diversity loss. We then show that spatial re-patterning buffers the impact of further stress on community structure. Finally, we identify multistability ranges of uniform and patterned community states and use them to propose forms of non-uniform ecosystem management that integrate the need for provisioning ecosystem services with the need to preserve community structure. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

Here, we use population genomics to evaluate the history and consequences of an invasion of wild tomato—Solanum pimpinellifolium—onto the Galápagos islands from continental South America. Using >300 archipelago and mainland collections, we infer this invasion was recent and largely the result of a single event from central Ecuador. Patterns of ancestry within the genomes of invasive plants also reveal post-colonization hybridization and introgression between S. pimpinellifolium and the closely related Galapagos endemic Solanum cheesmaniae. Of admixed invasive individuals, those that carry endemic alleles at one of two different carotenoid biosynthesis loci also have orange fruits— characteristic of the endemic species—instead of typical red S. pimpinellifolium fruits. We infer that introgression of two independent fruit color loci explains this observed trait convergence, suggesting that selection has favored repeated transitions of red to orange fruits on the Galapagos. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Background. The Malagasy Region, one of the top megadiversity regions, hosts one of the highest numbers of endemic and threatened organisms on earth. One of the most spectacular examples of ant radiation on the island has occurred in the hyperdiverse genus Pheidole. To this date, there are 135 described Madagascan Pheidole divided into 16 species-groups, and 97% of Malagasy species are endemic to the island. This study is a taxonomic revision of the Pheidole megacephala group, one of only two species-groups comprising a combination of native, endemic taxa and widely distributed introduced species. Methods. The diversity of the Malagasy members of the megacephala group was assessed via application of qualitative morphological and DNA sequence data. Qualitative, external morphological characteristics (e.g., head shape, gaster sculpture, body colouration) were evaluated in order to create a priori grouping hypotheses, and confirm and improve species delimitation. Mitochondrial DNA sequences from cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene fragments were analyzed to test the putative species previously delimited by morphological analyses. Results.Werecognize three species belonging to the megacephala group: P. megacephala (Fabricius, 1793), P. megatron Fischer & Fisher, 2013 and P. spinosa Forel, 1891 stat. nov. Pheidole spinosa is redescribed and elevated to the species level. The following names are recognized as junior synonyms of P. spinosa: P. megacephala scabrior Forel, 1891 syn. nov., P. picata Forel, 1891 syn. nov., P. picata gietleni Forel, 1905 syn. nov., P. picata bernhardae Emery, 1915 syn. nov., and P. decepticon Fischer & Fisher, 2013 syn. nov. The results are supplemented with an identification key to species for major workers of the megacephala group, high-resolution images for major and minor workers, and comments on the distribution and biology of all Malagasy members of the group. Our study revealed that Pheidole megacephala, a species listed among the 100 worst invasive species worldwide, occurs in both natural and disturbed sites in the Malagasy region. The two remaining members of the megacephala group, most likely endemic to this region, are also present in anthropogenic habitats and often co-occur with P. megacephala. It appears that the Malagasy members of the group are generalists and dominant in anthropogenic habitats. Additionally, we documented the presence of supermajors in colonies of P. spinosa-a phenomenon previously not known for this group. © 2022 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary changes in the anatomy and physiology of the female reproductive system underlie the origins and diversification of pregnancy in Eutherian (“Placental”) mammals. This developmental and evolutionary history constrains normal physiological functions and biases the ways in which dysfunction contributes to reproductive trait diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Here, we show that gene expression changes in the human endometrium during pregnancy are associated with the evolution of human-specific traits and pathologies of pregnancy. We found that hundreds of genes gained or lost endometrial expression in the human lineage. Among these are genes that may contribute to human-specific maternal-fetal communication (HTR2B) and maternal-fetal immunotolerance (PDCD1LG2) systems, as well as vascular remodeling and deep placental invasion (CORIN). These data suggest that explicit evolutionary studies of anatomical systems complement traditional methods for characterizing the genetic architecture of disease. We also anticipate our results will advance the emerging synthesis of evolution and medicine (“evolutionary medicine”) and be a starting point for more sophisticated studies of the maternal-fetal interface. Furthermore, the gene expression changes we identified may contribute to the development of diagnostics and interventions for adverse pregnancy outcomes. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Climate change (rainfall events and global warming) affects the survival of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) in winter. Appropriate water management can quickly reduce the mortality of alfalfa during winter. To determine how changes in water affect the cold resistance of alfalfa, we explored the root system traits under different rainfall events and the effects on cold resistance in three alfalfa cultivars. These were exposed to three simulated rainfall events (SRE) × two phases in a randomized complete block design with six replications. The three cultivars were WL168, WL353 and WL440, and the three SRE were irrigation once every second day (D2), every four days (D4) and every eight days (D8). There were two phases: Before cold acclimation and after cold acclimation. Our results demonstrated that a period of exposure to low temperature was required for alfalfa to achieve maximum cold resistance. The root system tended toward herringbone branching under D8, compared with D2 and D4, and demonstrated greater root biomass, crown diameter, root volume, average link length and topological index. Nevertheless, D8 had less lateral root length, root surface area, specific root length, root forks and fractal dimensions. Greater root biomass and topological index were beneficial to cold resistance in alfalfa, while more lateral roots and root forks inhibited its ability to survive winter. Alfalfa roots had higher proline, soluble sugar and starch content in D8 than in D2 and D4. In contrast, there was lower malondialdehyde in D8, indicating that alfalfa had better cold resistance following a longer irrigation interval before winter. After examining root biomass, root system traits and physiological indexes we concluded that WL168 exhibited stronger cold resistance. Our results contribute to greater understanding of root and cold stress, consequently providing references for selection of cultivars and field water management to improve cold resistance of alfalfa in the context of changes in rainfall patterns.  © 2021 Li et al.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease is marked by intracellular tau aggregates in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and extracellular amyloid aggregates in the default network (DN). Here, we examined codependent structural variations between the MTL’s most vulnerable structure, the hippocampus (HC), and the DN at subregion resolution in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). By leveraging the power of the approximately 40,000 participants of the UK Biobank cohort, we assessed impacts from the protective APOE ε2 and the deleterious APOE ε4 Alzheimer’s disease alleles on these structural relationships. We demonstrate ε2 and ε4 genotype effects on the inter-individual expression of HC-DN co-variation structural patterns at the population level. Across these HC-DN signatures, recurrent deviations in the CA1, CA2/3, molecular layer, fornix’s fimbria, and their cortical partners related to ADRD risk. Analyses of the rich phenotypic profiles in the UK Biobank cohort further revealed male-specific HC-DN associations with air pollution and female-specific associations with cardiovascular traits. We also showed that APOE ε2/2 interacts preferentially with HC-DN co-variation patterns in estimating social lifestyle in males and physical activity in females. Our structural, genetic, and phenotypic analyses in this large epidemiological cohort reinvigorate the often-neglected interplay between APOE ε2 dosage and sex and link APOE alleles to inter-individual brain structural differences indicative of ADRD familial risk. © 2022 Savignac et al.

	abstract = {Our understanding of the cellular composition and architecture of cancer has primarily advanced using 2D models and thin slice samples. This has granted spatial information on fundamental cancer biology and treatment response. However, tissues contain a variety of interconnected cells with different functional states and shapes, and this complex organization is impossible to capture in a single plane. Furthermore, tumours have been shown to be highly heterogenous, requiring large-scale spatial analysis to reliably profile their cellular and structural composition. Volumetric imaging permits the visualization of intact biological samples, thereby revealing the spatio-phenotypic and dynamic traits of cancer. This review focuses on new insights into cancer biology uniquely brought to light by 3D imaging and concomitant progress in cancer modelling and quantitative analysis. 3D imaging has the potential to generate broad knowledge advance from major mechanisms of tumour progression to new strategies for cancer treatment and patient diagnosis.

	abstract = {Over the past decade, concerns over microplastic pollution in the marine ecosystem has increasingly gained more attention, but research investigating the ingestion of microplastics by marine fish in Malaysia is still regrettably lacking. This study investigated the microplastic presence, abundance, and morphological types within the guts of four species of commercial marine fish (Atule mate, Crenimugil seheli, Sardinella fimbriata and Rastrelliger brachysoma) caught in seawater off the coast of Malaysia’s Northwest Peninsular. A total of 72 individual commercial marine fish guts from four species (fish per species n = 18) were examined. Remarkably, this study found that 100% of the samples contained microplastics. A total number of 432 microplastics (size < 5 mm) from the four species were found in the excised marine fish guts. The most common type of microplastic discovered was fragment, which accounted for 49.5% of all microplastics present. The gut microplastic content differed between species. Sardinella fimbriata recorded the greatest amount of microplastic ingestion, with an average microplastic count of 6.5 (±4.3) items per individual fish. However, there were no statistically significant differences found when comparing study species and different locations. SEM-EDX analysis confirmed the presence of microplastic particles by identifying the chemical elements found in the samples. Since the four studied species of commercial marine fish are popular protein sources in Malaysians’ daily diet, this study suggests potential microplastic exposure to humans via contaminated fish consumption in Malaysia, which was previously unknown. Based on previous scientific evidence, this study also demonstrates the high probability of microplastic ingestion in marine fish in the Malaysian seawater, which could have an adverse effect on fish health as well as marine biota.

	abstract = {Avian haemosporidians are parasites with great capacity to spread to new environments and new hosts, being considered a good model to host-parasite interactions studies. Here, we examine avian haemosporidian parasites in a protected area covered by Restinga vegetation in northeastern Brazil, to test the hypothesis that haemosporidian prevalence is related to individual-level traits (age and breeding season), species-specific traits (diet, foraging strata, period of activity, species body weight, migratory status, and nest shape), and climate factors (temperature and rainfall). We screened DNA from 1,466 birds of 70 species captured monthly from April 2013 to March 2015. We detected an overall prevalence (Plasmodium/ Haemoproteus infection) of 22% (44 host species) and parasite’s lineages were identified by mitochondrial cyt b gene. Our results showed that migration can be an important factor predicting the prevalence of Haemoproteus (Parahaemoproteus), but not Plasmodium, in hosts. Besides, the temperature, but not rainfall, seems to predict the prevalence of Plasmodium in this bird community. Neither individual-level traits analyzed nor the other species-specific traits tested were related to the probability of a bird becoming infected by haemosporidians. Our results point the importance of conducting local studies in particular environments to understand the degree of generality of factors impacting parasite prevalence in bird communities. Despite our attempts to find patterns of infection in this bird community, we should be aware that an avian haemosporidian community organization is highly complex and this complexity can be attributed to an intricate net of factors, some of which were not observed in this study and should be evaluated in future studies. We evidence the importance of looking to host-parasite relationships in a more close scale, to assure that some effects may not be obfuscated by differences in host life-history.

	abstract = {Seed germination is a key stage in the life history of plants, which has a crucial effect on plant community structure. Climate change has substantially altered the surface soil temperature and light availability, which can affect seed germination. However, whether the seed germination of different functional groups is affected by the interactions of light and temperature remains unclear. Under laboratory conditions, we examined the effects of low temperature and darkness, as well as their interaction, on the seed germination of 16 species belonging to three plant functional groups (annual and biennials, perennial grasses, and perennial forbs) in a typical steppe, Northern China. We found that low temperature had a significant negative effect on seed germination of all species. Low temperature significantly decreased the final germination percentage and germinative force of the three plant functional groups, and the germination duration of perennial grasses. Darkness significantly decreased the germinative force of perennial forbs and total seeds, and the germination duration of perennial grasses. The interactive effects of light and temperature on the seed final germination percentage and germinative force of perennial grass indicated that darkness strengthened the inhibitory effect of low temperature on the seed germination of the grass functional group. Our study indicate that the seed germination of different plant functional groups varied greatly in response to changing environmental conditions. Our results suggest that future climate change could alter the regeneration and species composition of plant communities through changing seed germination. © 2022 Liu et al.},

	abstract = {Climate warming has the potential to influence plant flowering phenology which in turn can have broader ecological consequences. Herbarium collections offer a source of historical plant data that makes possible the ability to document and better understand how warming climate can influence long-term shifts in flowering phenology. We examined the influence of annual, winter, and spring temperatures on the flowering phenology of herbarium specimens for 36 species collected from 1884–2015. We then compared the response to warming between native and nonnative, woody and herbaceous, dry and fleshy fruit, and spring vs summer blooming species. Across all species, plants flowered 2.26 days earlier per 1 ◦C increase in annual average temperatures and 2.93 days earlier per 1 ◦C increase in spring onset average temperatures. Winter temperatures did not significantly influence flowering phenology. The relationship of temperature and flowering phenology was not significantly different between native and non-native species. Woody species flowered earlier than herbaceous species only in response to increasing annual temperatures. There was no difference in the phenological response between species with dry fruits and those fleshy fruits for any of the temperature periods. Spring blooming species exhibited a significantly greater phenological response to warming yearly average temperatures than summer blooming species. Although herbarium specimens can reveal climate change impacts on phenology, it is also evident that the phenological responses to warming vary greatly among species due to differences in functional traits such as those considered here, as well as other factors.

	abstract = {In the course of global climate change, central Europe is experiencing more frequent and prolonged periods of drought. The drought years 2018 and 2019 affected European beeches (Fagus sylvatica L.) differently: even in the same stand, drought damaged trees neighboured healthy trees, suggesting that the genotype rather than the environment was responsible for this conspicuous pattern. We used this natural experiment to study the genomic basis of drought resistance with Pool-GWAS. Contrasting the extreme phenotypes identified 106 significantly associated SNPs throughout the genome. Most annotated genes with associated SNPs (>70%) were previously implicated in the drought reaction of plants. Non-synonymous substitutions led either to a functional amino acid exchange or premature termination. A SNP-assay with 70 loci allowed predicting drought phenotype in 98.6% of a validation sample of 92 trees. Drought resistance in European beech is a moderately polygenic trait that should respond well to natural selection, selective management, and breeding. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

A unique ‘DNA barcoding’ signature (mtDNA COI and Cytb) revealed that it differs from any other previously bar-coded goby species clustered phylogenetically with the shrimp-gobies group, in which Cryptocentrus is the most speciose genus. A morphological study supported the assignment of the fish to Cryptocentrus and differentiated the new species from its congeners. The species is described here as Cryptocentrus steinhardti n. sp. However, the present phylogenetic analysis demonstrates a paraphyly of Cryptocentrus and emphasizes the need for revision of the genus based on integrating morphological and genetic characteristics. This finding constitutes the third record of an invasive shrimp goby in the Mediterranean Sea. An intriguing ecological issue arises regarding the possible formation of a fish-shrimp symbiosis in a newly invaded territory. Describing an alien tropical species in the Mediterranean prior to its discovery in native distribution is an unusual event, although not the first such case.

	abstract = {Background: Rainfed agriculture plays key role in ensuring food security and maintain ecological balance. Especially in developing areas, most grain food are produced rainfed agricultural ecosystem. Therefore, the increase of crop yields in rainfed agricultural ecosystem becomes vital as well as ensuring global food security. Methods: The potential roles of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in improving crop yields under rainfed condition were explored based on 546 pairs of observations published from 1950 to 2021. Results: AMF inoculation increased 23.0% crop yields based on 13 popular crops under rainfed condition. Not only was crop biomass of shoot and root increased 24.2% and 29.6% by AMF inocula, respectively but also seed number and pod/fruit number per plant were enhanced markedly. Further, the effect of AMF on crop yields depended on different crop groups. AMF improved more yield of N-fixing crops than non-N-fixing crops. The effect of AMF changed between grain and non-grain crops with the effect size of 0.216 and 0.352, respectively. AMF inoculation enhances stress resistance and photosynthesis of host crop in rainfed agriculture. Conclusion: AMF increased crop yields by enhancing shoot biomass due to the improvement of plant nutrition, photosynthesis, and stress resistance in rainfed field. Our findings provide a new view for understanding the sustainable productivity in rainfed agroecosystem, which enriched the theory of AMF functional diversity. This study provided a theoretical and technical way for sustainable production under rainfed agriculture. Copyright © 2022 Wu et al.},

	abstract = {Carbon sequestration in forest soil is critical for reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and slowing down global warming. However, little is known about the difference in soil organic carbon (SOC) among different stand ages and the relative importance of biotic and abiotic variations such as soil microbial community and soil physicochemical properties in the regulation of SOC in forests. In the present study, we measured the SOC of the topsoil (0-10 cm) in Chinese subtropical Cunninghamia lanceolata plantations of three different stand ages (young plantation of 6 years, middle-aged plantation of 12 years, and mature plantation of 25 years). We further measured microbial community composition by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and soil organic carbon physical fractions by wet sieving and density floating as well as other physicochemical properties. The effects of the main impact factors on SOC were investigated. The results showed that: the middle-aged plantation had significantly higher SOC (10.63 g kg−1) than the young plantation (5.33 g kg−1), and that of the mature plantation (7.83 g kg−1) was in between. Besides, the soil total PLFAs and all the functional groups (i.e., bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria) of PLFAs were significantly higher in the middle-aged plantation than in the young plantation and the mature plantation. Soil physicochemical properties, including physical fractions, differed among plantations of the three stand ages. Notably, the proportion of organic carbon protected within microaggregates was significantly higher in the middle-aged plantation (40.4%) than those in the young plantation (29.2%) and the mature plantation (27.8%), indicating that the middle-aged Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation had stronger soil organic carbon stability. Both soil microbial community and physicochemical properties exerted dominant effects on SOC and jointly explained 82.7% of the variance of SOC among different stand ages. Among them, total and all the functional groups of PLFAs, nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, and organic carbon protected within microaggregates had a significant positive correlation with SOC. These results highlight the important role of soil biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the contents of SOC in forests of different stand ages. This study provides a theoretical basis for forestry management and forest carbon cycling models. © 2022 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: The Ebo Forest area is a highly threatened centre of diversity in the Littoral Region of Cameroon, globally important for conservation with many threatened species including 68 threatened species of plant, yet not formally protected. The tropical African evergreen forest tree genus Uvariopsis Engl. & Diels (Annonaceae) is characterised by unisexual, usually cauliflorous flowers with a uniseriate corolla of four petals, and two sepals. Cameroon is the centre of diversity of the genus with 14 of the 19 known species. Methods: The herbarium collection MacKinnon 51 from Ebo is hypothesized to represent a new species to science of Uvariopsis. This hypothesis is tested by the study of herbarium specimens from a number of herbaria known to hold important collections from Cameroon and surrounding countries. Results: We test the hypothesis that MacKinnon 51 represents a new species to science, using the most recent dichotomous identification key, and comparing it morphologically with reference material of all known species of the genus. We make a detailed comparative morphological study focussing on three other Cameroonian species, Uvariopsis solheidii, U. korupensis and the sympatric U. submontana. In the context of a review of the pollination biology of Uvariopsis, we speculate that in a genus otherwise with species with dull, flesh-coloured (pink, red to brown) flowers pollinated (where known) by diptera, orthoptera and blattodea (flies, crickets and cockroaches), the glossy, pale yellow-green flowers of Uvariopsis dicaprio, with additional traits unique in the genus, may be pollinated by nocturnal moths. Based on MacKinnon 51, we formally name Uvariopsis dicaprio Cheek & Gosline (Annonaceae) as new to science, and we describe, and illustrate, and map it. Restricted so far to a single site in evergreen forest in the Ebo Forest, Littoral Region, Cameroon, Uvariopsis dicaprio is provisionally assessed as Critically Endangered using the IUCN, 2012 standard because the forest habitat of this species remains unprotected, and there exist imminent threats of logging and conversion to plantations. Discussion: We show that the highest density of species of the genus (12), and of narrow endemics (5), is found in the Cross-Sanaga Interval of SE Nigeria and Western Cameroon. A revised key to the 14 Cameroonian species of Uvariopsis is presented. We review the other seven narrowly endemic and threatened species unique to the Ebo forest of Cameroon and discuss the phytogeographic affinities of the area. Conclusions: Uvariopsis dicaprio adds to the growing list of species threatened with extinction at Ebo Forest due to current anthropogenic pressures.  Copyright 2022 Gosline et al.},

	abstract = {Resilience, the capacity for a system to bounce-back after a perturbation, is critical for conservation and restoration efforts. Different functional traits have differential effects on system-level resilience. We test this experimentally in a lab system consisting of algae consumed by zooplankton, snails, or both, using an eutrophication event as a perturbation. We examined seston settlement load, chlorophyll-a and ammonium concentration as gauges of resilience. We find that Daphnia magna increased our measures of resilience. But this effect is not consistent across ecosystem measures; in fact, D. magna increased the difference between disturbed and undisturbed treatments in seston settlement loads. We have some evidence of shifting reproductive strategy in response to perturbation in D. magna and in the presence of Physa sp. These shifts correspond with altered population levels in D. magna, suggesting feedback loops between the herbivore species. While these results suggest only an ambiguous connection between functional traits to ecosystem resilience, they point to the difficulties in establishing such a link: indirect effects of one species on reproduction of another and different scales of response among components of the system, are just two examples that may compromise the power of simple predictions. © Copyright 2022 Werba et al.},

	abstract = {Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) enables plants to respond to global changes. However, causes for ITV, especially from biotic components such as herbivory, are not well understood. We explored whether small vertebrate herbivores (hares and geese) impact ITV of a dominant clonal plant (Elytrigia atherica) in local communities. Moreover, we looked at the relative importance of their direct (e.g., selective grazing) and indirect effects (altering genotypic richness/diversity and abiotic environment) on ITV. We used exclosures at two successional stages in a Dutch saltmarsh, where grazing pressure at the early successional stage was ca. 1.5 times higher than that of the intermediate successional stage. We measured key functional traits of E. atherica including height, aboveground biomass, flowering (flower or not), specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content in local communities (1 m × 1 m plots) inside and outside the exclosures. We determined genotypic richness and diversity of each plant using molecular markers. We further measured abiotic variations in topography and clay thickness (a proxy for soil total nitrogen). Structural equation models revealed that small herbivores significantly promoted ITV in height and flowering at the early successional stage, while they marginally promoted ITV in height at the intermediate successional stage. Moreover, the direct effects of herbivores played a major role in promoting ITV. Small herbivores decreased genotypic diversity at the intermediate successional stage, but genotypic richness and diversity did not impact ITV. Small herbivores did not alter topographic variation and variation in clay thickness, but these variations increased ITV in all traits at the early successional stage. Small herbivores may not only impact trait means in plants as studies have shown but also their ITV.  Copyright 2021 Chen et al.},

The fundamental components of grassland habitats are grasses and grass-like plants, but diverse assemblages of other plant life forms and diverse animal communities also contribute to grassland biodiversity. Grasses have evolved traits allowing them to cope with climatic extremes, specific soil conditions, fires, and herbivory, all of which sustain grasslands by limiting the establishment, survival, growth, and dominance of woody vegetation. Grasslands occur in almost all climatic zones, except the poles, extreme arid zones, and the highest mountains (Figure 1). Temperate grassland habitats include Eurasian steppes, North American prairies, the pampas lowlands of South America, and Patagonian steppe. Tropical and subtropical grasslands (savannas) occur mostly in Africa and Australia, but are also found in the north of South America, in the southern United States, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

Studies of adaptations in avian systems have been central to key conceptual and empirical advances in the field of evolutionary biology and, over the past decade, leveraged the proliferation of a diversity of genomic tools. In this synthesis, we first discuss how the different genomic architectures of avian traits are relevant to adaptive phenotypes. A mutation's chromosomal location (e.g., microchromosomes or sex chromosomes) or its specific nature (e.g., nucleotide substitution or structural variant) will determine how it may evolve and shape adaptive phenotypes, and we review different examples from the avian literature. We next describe how the source of adaptive variation, whether from de novo mutations, existing genetic variation, or introgression from another species, can affect the evolutionary dynamics of a trait. Our third section reviews case studies where the genetic basis of key avian adaptive phenotypes (e.g., bill morphology or plumage coloration) have been revealed. We end by providing an outlook and identifying important challenges to this field, both by focusing on technical aspects, such as the completeness of genomic assemblies and the ability to validate genetic associations with new sources of data, as well as by discussing the existential threat posed to birds from habitat alteration and climate change. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of population differentiation and gene flow in insect vectors of plant diseases is crucial for the implementation of management programs of disease. We investigated morphological and genome-wide variation across the distribution range of the spittlebug Philaenus spumarius (Linnaeus, 1758) (Hemiptera, Auchenorrhyncha, Aphrophoridae), presently the most important vector of the plant pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa Wells et al., 1987 in Europe. We found genome-wide divergence between P. spumarius and a very closely related species, P.Tesselatus Melichar, 1899, at RAD sequencing markers. The two species may be identified by the morphology of male genitalia but are not differentiated at mitochondrial COI, making DNA barcoding with this gene ineffective. This highlights the importance of using integrative approaches in taxonomy. We detected admixture between P.Tesselatus from Morocco and P. spumarius from the Iberian Peninsula, suggesting gene-flow between them. Within P. spumarius, we found a pattern of isolation-by-distance in European populations, likely acting alongside other factors restricting gene flow. Varying levels of co-occurrence of different lineages, showing heterogeneous levels of admixture, suggest other isolation mechanisms. The transatlantic populations of North America and Azores were genetically closer to the British population analyzed here, suggesting an origin from North-Western Europe, as already detected with mitochondrial DNA. Nevertheless, these may have been produced through different colonization events. We detected SNPs with signatures of positive selection associated with environmental variables, especially related to extremes and range variation in temperature and precipitation. The population genomics approach provided new insights into the patterns of divergence, gene flow and adaptation in these spittlebugs and led to several hypotheses that require further local investigation. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

It has been suggested that bee sociality14 and diet15 affect bee foraging ranges, but how these traits and their potential interactions drive foraging ranges remains unclear. We analyzed flight distance data from 90 bee species and developed an agent-based model to test how social, dietary, and environmental factors affect foraging ranges. We confirm that bee sociality is positively associated with foraging range, with average-sized social bees foraging up to 3 times farther from the nest than size-matched solitary bees. A comparative analysis of social bees and computer simulations shows that foraging distances increase with colony size, supporting the hypothesis that greater foraging distances are an emergent property of increasing colony sizes in a food-limited environment. Flower constancy and communication, two traits often found in social bees, synergistically increase foraging distances further in many simulated environments. Diet breadth (oligolectic versus polylectic diet), on the other hand, does not appear to affect foraging ranges in solitary bees. Our findings suggest that multiple traits linked to bee sociality explain why social bees have greater foraging ranges. This has implications for predicting pollination services and for developing effective conservation strategies for bees and isolated plant populations.15,16,17,18,19 © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The development of phosphorus-efficient crop cultivars boosts productivity while lowering eutrophication in the environment. It is feasible to improve the efficiency of phosphorus (P) absorption in lentils by enhancing phosphorus absorption through root architectural traits. The root architectural traits of 110 diverse lentil genotypes of Indian and Mediterranean origin were assessed, and the relationships between traits were investigated. In a hydroponics experiment, the lentil lines were examined at the seedling stage under two conditions: adequate P supply and deficient P supply. The Pearson correlation coefficients between root architectural traits and genetic diversity among lentil lines were assessed. To estimate variance components, a model (fixed factor) was used. In this experiment, both phosphorus (P) and genotype were fixed variables. Our lentil lines showed significant genetic variability and considerable genetic diversity for all traits under both treatments. The TRL (total root length) and PRL (primary root length) showed strong positive associations with all other characteristics excluding root average diameter (RAD) in both P treatments. In both P treatments, the RAD revealed a negative significant association with Total Root Tips (TRT), as well as total root volume (TRV) and total root forks (TRF) in the deficit conditions of P. Total root volume (TRV), total surface area (TSA), and total root tips had higher coefficient variance values. The first two principal components represented 67.88% and 66.19% of the overall variance in the adequate and deficit P treatments respectively. The Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') revealed that RAD, PRL, and TSA had more variability than TRT and TRF under both treatments. According to the Comprehensive Phosphorus Efficiency Measure (CPEM), the best five highly efficient genotypes are PLL 18-09, PLS 18-01, PLL 18-25, PLS 18-23, and PLL 18-07, while IG112131, P560206, IG334, L11-231, and PLS18-67 are highly inefficient genotypes. The above contrasting diverse lentil genotypes can be utilized to produce P-efficient lentil cultivars. The lentil germplasm with potentially favorable root traits can be suggested to evaluated for other abiotic stress to use them in crop improvement programme. The scientific breakthroughs in root trait phenotyping have improved the chances of establishing trait-allele relationships. As a result, genotype-to-phenotype connections can be predicted and verified with exceptional accuracy, making it easier to find and incorporate favourable nutrition-related genes/QTLs in to breeding programme.  © 2022 Aski et al.},

	abstract = {Rapid rise in temperature in summer causes severe injury to cool-season turfgrass of both native species and introduced ones in Heilongjiang of Northeast China. The objectives of this study were to compare physiological responses to seasonal heat stresses and turf performances between native and introduced commercial Poa accessions. Three Chinese native Poa species (i.e., P. pratensis, P. sibirica and P. sphondylodes) and three USA Kentucky bluegrass cultivars (ie. ‘Midnight’, ‘Moonlight’ and ‘BlueChip’) were evaluated under field conditions in 2017 and 2018. All accessions showed unique characteristics and considerable seasonal differences in response to temperatures. However, performances over all accessions were largely similar in early spring and autumn. In summer, native P. pratensis performed similar to ‘Midnight’, ‘Moonlight’ or ‘BlueChip’, with respect to such traits or parameters as quality, coverage, color intensity, growth rate, osmolytes, ROS and anti-oxidant production. Native P. pratensis could be used as a new turf resource for further improvement and application under the specific climatic conditions in Heilongjiang; native P. sphondylodes may be used in repairing damaged environments or for alternative seasonal greenness. 2021 Chen et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Mining deposits often contain high levels of toxic elements such as mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As) representing strong environmental hazards. The purpose of this study was the isolation for plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPBs) that can improve phytoremediation of such mine waste deposits. Methods: We isolated native soil bacteria from the rhizosphere of plants of mine waste deposits and agricultural land that was previously mine tailings from Tlalpujahua Michoacán, Mexico, and were identified by their fatty acid profile according to the MIDI Sherlock system. Plant growth promoting traits of all bacterial isolates were examined including production of 3-indoleacetic acid (IAA), siderophores, biofilm formation, and phosphate solubilization. Finally, the response of selected bacteria to mercury and arsenic was examined an in-vitro assay. Results: A total 99 bacterial strains were isolated and 48 identified, representing 34 species belonging to 23 genera. Sixty six percent of the isolates produced IAA of which Pseudomonas fluorescens TL97 produced the most. Herbaspirillum huttiense TL36 performed best in terms of phosphate solubilization and production of siderophores. In terms of biofilm formation, Bacillus atrophaeus TL76 was the best. Discussion: Most of the bacteria isolates showed high level of tolerance to the arsenic (as HAsNa2O4 and AsNaO2), whereas most isolates were susceptible to HgCl2. Three of the selected bacteria with PGP traits Herbispirillum huttiense TL36, Klebsiella oxytoca TL49 and Rhizobium radiobacter TL52 were also tolerant to high concentrations of mercury chloride, this might could be used for restoring or phytoremediating the adverse environmental conditions present in mine waste deposits. © Copyright 2023 Rojas-Solis et al.},

	abstract = {Microbial fibrinolytic proteases are therapeutic enzymes responsible to ameliorate thrombosis, a fatal cardiac-disorder which effectuates due to excessive fibrin accumulation in blood vessels. Inadequacies such as low fibrin specificity, lethal aftereffects and short life-span of available fibrinolytic enzymes stimulates an intensive hunt for novel, efficient and safe substitutes. Therefore, we herewith suggest a novel and potent fibrinolytic enzyme RFEA1 from Bacillus cereus RSA1 (MK288105). Although, attributes such as in-vitro purification, characterization and thrombolytic potential of RFEA1 were successfully accomplished in our previous study. However, it is known that structure-function traits and mode of action significantly aid to commercialization of an enzyme. Also, predicting structural model of a protein from its amino acid sequence is challenging in computational biology owing to intricacy of energy functions and inspection of vast conformational space. Our present study thus reports In-silico structural-functional analysis of RFEA1. Sequence based modelling approaches such as_Iterative threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER), SWISS-MODEL, RaptorX and Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre2) were employed to model three-dimensional structure of RFEA1 and the modelled RFEA1 was validated by structural analysis and verification server (SAVES v6.0). The modelled crystal structure revealed the presence of high affinity Ca1 binding site, associated with hydrogen bonds at Asp147, Leu181, Ile185 and Val187 residues. RFEA1 is structurally analogous to Subtilisin E from Bacillus subtilis 168. Molecular docking analysis using PATCH DOCK and FIRE DOCK servers was performed to understand the interaction of RFEA1 with substrate fibrin. Strong RFEA1-fibrin interaction was observed with high binding affinity (-21.36 kcal/mol), indicating significant fibrinolytic activity and specificity of enzyme RFEA1. Overall, the computational research suggests that RFEA1 is a subtilisinlike serine endopeptidase with proteolytic potential, involved in thrombus hydrolysis. © 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Alcohol dependence is associated with adverse consequences of alcohol (ethanol) use and is evident in most severe cases of alcohol use disorder (AUD). The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) plays a critical role in the development of alcohol dependence and escalation of alcohol consumption in dependent subjects. Molecular mechanisms underlying the CeA-driven behavioral changes are not well understood. Here, we examined the effects of alcohol on global gene expression in the CeA using a chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor model in rats and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The CIE procedure resulted in robust changes in CeA gene expression during intoxica-tion, as the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was significantly greater than those expected by chance. Over-representation analysis of cell types, functional groups and molecular pathways revealed biological categories potentially important for the development of alcohol dependence in our model. Genes specific for astrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells were over-represented in the DEG category, suggesting that these cell types were particu-larly affected by the CIE procedure. The majority of the over-represented functional groups and molecular pathways were directly related to the functions of glial and endothelial cells, including extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, myelination, and the regulation of innate immune re-sponse. A coordinated regulation of several ECM metalloproteinases (e.g., Mmp2; Mmp14), their substrates (e.g., multiple collagen genes and myelin basic protein; Mbp), and a metalloproteinase inhibitor, Reck, suggests a specific mechanism for ECM re-organization in response to chronic alco-hol, which may modulate neuronal activity and result in behavioral changes, such as an escalation of alcohol drinking. Our results highlight the importance of glial and endothelial cells in the effects of chronic alcohol exposure on the CeA, and demonstrate further insight into the molecular mechanisms of alcohol dependence in rats. These molecular targets may be used in future studies to develop therapeutics to treat AUD. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background. Freshwater fish populations are facing multiple stressors, including climate change, species invasion, and anthropogenic interference. Temporal studies of fish functional diversity and community assembly rules based on trait-environment relationships provide insights into fish community structure in riverine ecosystems. Methods. Fish samples were collected in 2015 in the Min River, the largest freshwater riverine system in Southeastern China. Fish functional diversity was compared with the background investigation in 1979. Changes in functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence, and functional beta diversity were analyzed. Relationships between functional diversity and environmental factors were modeled by random forest regression. Correlations between fish functional traits and environmental factors were detected by fourth-corner combined with RLQ analysis. Results. Functional richness was significantly reduced in 2015 compared with 1979. Functional beta diversity in 2015 was significantly higher than that in 1979, with functional nestedness being the driving component. Reduction of functional richness and domination of functional nestedness is associated with species loss. Trait convergence was the dominant mechanism driving the temporal changes of functional diversity. Precipitation, temperature, species invasion, and human population were the most significant factors driving fish functional diversity. Higher precipitation, higher temperature, and presence of invasive species were significantly associated with higher swimming factor and higher relative eye diameter, while the opposite environmental conditions were significantly associated with higher pectoral fin length and eurytopic water flow preference. Conclusions. Environmental filtering is the dominant temporal assembly mechanism shaping fish community structure. This work contributes to the understanding of temporal freshwater fish community assembly and the associations between fish functional structure and local environmental conditions, which will be informative for future freshwater fish conservation.

	abstract = {The invasive Asian earthworms, Amynthas tokioensis and A. agrestis, have been successful in entering North American forests in recent decades, with significant damage to both soils and above-ground environments. This success could be driven in part by a polyploid genetic system and parthenogenetic reproduction, often suggested as benefits for invasive species. Therefore, we assessed the genetic population structure, genetic diversity, and reproductive system of both species using morphological traits and panels of microsatellite markers. A total of 216 A. tokioensis and 196 A. agrestis from six sites in Vermont USA were analyzed. Although all worms were morphologically hermaphroditic, all the A. agrestis lacked the male pore (the structure allowing pass of sperm between individuals), and only 19% of the A. tokioensis possessed the male pore. All A. tokioensis earthworms were triploid (scored for three alleles for at least 1 locus, and usually several), and A. agrestis was a mix of triploid and diploid individuals. Notable was the high proportion (80%) of A. agrestis earthworms that were diploid at one site. There was clearly clonal reproduction, with identical seven- locus genotypes observed for earthworms from each site, with as many as 45 individuals with the identical genotype at one site. However, the earthworms were also genetically diverse, with 14 genotypes observed for A. tokioensis and 54 for A. agrestis, and with many singleton genotypes (a single individual). Most genotypes (71% for A. tokioensis and 92% for A. agrestis) were found at a single site. The greatest number of genotypes was found at a commercial nursery where fully 23/26 A. agrestis earthworms were singleton genotypes. As expected for the pattern of private clone alleles at sites, several measures of geographic genetic differentiation were positive, and as expected for triploid systems, an AMOVA analysis showed high within-individual genetic diversity. The paradox of clear clonal reproduction, but with a great number of genotypes for each species, and the mix of triploid and diploid individuals could be explained if the worms have been sexually reproductive, with the switch to the uniparental system only recently (or even if sexual reproduction is episodic). Last, a large number of microsatellite loci were recovered for each species and there sequence and suggested PCR primers are provided for free use by other researchers.

	abstract = {A major malignant trait of gliomas is their remarkable infiltration capacity. When glioma develops, the tumor cells have already reached the distant part. Therefore, complete removal of the glioma is impossible. Recently, research on the involvement of the tumor microenvironment in glioma invasion has advanced. Local hypoxia triggers cell migration as an environmental factor. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, produced in tumor cells under hypoxia, promotes the transcription of various invasion related molecules. The extracellular matrix surrounding tumors is degraded by proteases secreted by tumor cells and simultaneously replaced by an extracellular matrix that promotes infiltration. Astrocytes and microglia become tumor-associated astrocytes and glioma-associated macrophages/microglia, respectively, in relation to tumor cells. These cells also promote glioma invasion. Interactions between glioma cells actively promote infiltration of each other. Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy transform the microenvironment, allowing glioma cells to invade. These findings indicate that the tumor microenvironment may be a target for glioma invasion. On the other hand, because the living body actively promotes tumor infiltration in response to the tumor, it is necessary to reconsider whether the invasion itself is friend or foe to the brain. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Introduction: Although sleep disturbances are well documented in bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs), significantly less research has examined whether these disturbances are present in those at risk for developing BSDs or with subsyndromal symptoms. The present study examined associations between risk for BSDs, as measured by the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS), and sleep assessed using experience sampling. We assessed whether intraindividual variability in sleep was associated with affect, cognition, and behavior in daily life and potential directionality of these relationships. Methods: 233 young adults oversampled for high scores on the HPS completed 14 days of experience sampling assessing total sleep time (TST), bed/rise time, sleep quality, affect (negative and positive affect), cognition (difficulty concentrating, racing thoughts), and behavior (impulsivity) in daily life. We used Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM) to assess within-person links between sleep and bipolar spectrum psychopathology. Results: HPS scores were associated with less TST, later bedtime, and more variable TST and bedtime. Variability in TST was associated with negative affect, difficulty concentrating/racing thoughts, and impulsivity. Within-person decreases in sleep were associated with next day increases in negative affect, stress, difficulty concentrating, and racing thoughts. Limitations: Measurement of sleep was limited. Future studies should examine both objective measures of sleep (e.g., actigraphy) and fragmentation in sleep. Conclusions: Risk for BSD was associated with similar patterns of sleep disruptions as seen in BSDs. Important dynamic links between sleep and bipolar spectrum psychopathology emerged indicating that sleep is an important target for improving symptoms of BSDs in daily life. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Gallery forests are important to the maintenance of a substantial portion of the biodiversity in neotropical savanna regions, but management guidelines specific to this forest type are limited. Here, we use birds as study group to assess if: (1) functional traits can predict the abundance and occupancy of forest species within a savanna landscape, (2) habitat structures influence the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of forest assemblages, and (3) less diverse gallery forest assemblages are a nested subset of more diverse assemblages living near continuous forests. Then, we propose strategies on how gallery forests can be managed to maintain their species assemblages amidst the fast expansion of human activities across tropical savanna landscapes. We studied 26 sites of gallery forests in an Amazonian savanna landscape and found that: (1) habitat specificity is the only functional trait that predicts species abundance and occupancy across a landscape; (2) phylogenetic diversity is negatively correlated with understory foliage density; (3) the percentage of forests and savannas around sites is positively correlated with both phylogenetic and functional diversity; (4) increasing human activities around gallery forest negatively influences taxonomic and functional diversity; and (5) forest bird assemblages are not distributed at random across the landscape but show a nested pattern caused by selective colonization mediated by habitat filtering. Our combined findings have three implications for the design of conservation strategies for gallery forest bird assemblages. First, maintaining the connectivity between gallery forests and adjacent continuous forests is essential because gallery forest bird assemblages are derived from continuous forest species assemblages. Second, because most species use the savanna matrix to move across the landscape, effectively managing the savanna matrices where gallery forests are embedded is as important to maintaining viable populations of forest bird species as managing the gallery forest themselves. Third, in savanna landscapes planned to be used for agriculture production, protecting gallery forests alone is not enough. Instead, gallery forests should be protected with surrounding savanna buffers to avoid the detrimental effects (edge effects and isolation) of human activities on their biodiversity. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

	abstract = {AUUnd:ePrsletaansedcinongfitrhmetoharitgailnlhseoafdbiniogdleivveelrssairtyerheapsrebseenetnedacnorarsepctilrya:tion since the days of early naturalists. The immense complexity of ecological, evolutionary, and spatial processes, however, has made this goal elusive to this day. Computer models serve progress in many scientific fields, but in the fields of macroecology and macroevolution, eco-evolutionary models are comparatively less developed. We present a general, spatially explicit, eco-evolutionary engine with a modular implementation that enables the modeling of multiple macroecological and macroevolutionary processes and feedbacks across representative spatiotemporally dynamic landscapes. Modeled processes can include species' abiotic tolerances, biotic interactions, dispersal, speciation, and evolution of ecological traits. Commonly observed biodiversity patterns, such as α, β, and γ. diversity, species ranges, ecological traits, and phylogenies, emerge as simulations proceed. As an illustration, we examine alternative hypotheses expected to have shaped the latitudinal diversity gradient (LDG) during the Earth's Cenozoic era. Our exploratory simulations simultaneously produce multiple realistic biodiversity patterns, such as the LDG, current species richness, and range size frequencies, as well as phylogenetic metrics. The model engine is open source and available as an R package, enabling future exploration of various landscapes and biological processes, while outputs can be linked with a variety of empirical biodiversity patterns. This work represents a key toward a numeric, interdisciplinary, and mechanistic understanding of the physical and biological processes that shape Earth's biodiversity. © 2021 Hagen et al.

	abstract = {Maize germplasm has greater latent potential to address the global food and feed crisis because of its high radiation, water and nutrient efficiencies. Photosynthetic and canopy architectural traits in maize are important in determining yield. The present study aimed to screen a subset of local maize accessions in Sri Lanka to evaluate their photosynthetic, biomass and yield related traits and to identify resource efficient germplasm. Experiments were carried out in the Ampara district of Sri Lanka. Eight maize accessions viz; SEU2, SEU6, SEU9, SEU10, SEU14, SEU15, SEU17 and SEU17 and two elite F1 cultivars (cv. Pacific-999 and cv. Bhadra) were analyzed under field conditions. Our results showed that maize genotypes produced a lower leaf area index (LAI) at the third and tenth week after field planting (WAP). However, the LAI was significantly increased in six WAP by Pacific-999, SEU2, SEU9, and SEU15. A similar trend was observed for percentage of light interception at three WAP (47%), six WAP (>64%), and decreased at 10 WAP. In addition, LAI maximum values were between 3.0 and 3.5, allowing 80% of the incident light to be intercepted by maize canopies. The estimated light extinction coefficient (k) remained lower (<0.5), suggesting that maize leaves are eractophilic canopies. Although fractional interception (f) varies, SEU2 and SEU9 had the highest values (0.57), and quantum yields of PSII (>0.73) in dark-adapted leaves. In addition, Pacific-999, SEU2, SEU9, and SEU17 had significantly higher rates of photosynthesis with minimal stomatal conductance and transpiration rates. As a result, they outperformed the control plants in terms of biomass, cob weight and grain yield. This suggests that native maize germplasm could be introduced as novel, less resource-intensive cultivars to sustain global food security. Copyright 2023 Mubarak et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Plastic pollution affects all ecosystems, and detrimental effects to animals have been reported in a growing number of studies. However, there is a paucity of evidence for effects on terrestrial animals in comparison to those in the marine realm. Methods. We used the fly Drosophila melanogaster to study the effects that exposure to plastics may have on life history traits and immune response. We reared flies in four conditions: In media containing 1% virgin polyethylene, with no chemical additives; in media supplemented with 1% or 4% polyvinyl chloride, known to have a high content of added chemicals; and control flies in non-supplemented media. Plastic particle size ranged from 23–500 µm. We studied fly survival to viral infection, the length of the larval and pupal stage, sex ratios, fertility and the size of the resultant adult flies. We then performed crossings of F1 flies in non-supplemented media and looked at the life history traits of the F2. Results. Flies treated with plastics in the food media showed changes in fertility and sex ratio, but showed no differences in developmental times, adult size or the capacity to fight infections in comparison with controls. However, the offspring of treated flies reared in non-supplemented food had shorter life cycles, and those coming from both polyvinyl chloride treatments were smaller than those offspring of controls.

	abstract = {With accelerating global warming, understanding the evolutionary dynamics of plant adaptation to environmental change is increasingly urgent. Here we reveal the enigmatic history of the genus Cochlearia (Brassicaceae), a Pleistocene relic that originated from a drought-adapted Mediterranean sister genus during the Miocene. Cochlearia rapidly diversified and adapted to circum-Arctic regions and other cold-characterized habitat types during the Pleistocene. This sudden change in ecological preferences was accompanied by a highly complex, reticulate polyploid evolution, which was apparently triggered by the impact of repeated Pleistocene glaciation cycles. Our results illustrate that two early diversified arctic-alpine diploid gene pools contributed differently to the evolution of this young polyploid genus now captured in a cold-adapted niche. Metabolomics revealed central carbon metabolism responses to cold in diverse species and ecotypes, likely due to continuous connections to cold habitats that may have facilitated widespread adaptation to alpine and subalpine habitats, and which we speculate were coopted from existing drought adaptations. Given the growing scientific interest in adaptive evolution of temperature-related traits, our results provide much-needed taxonomic and phylogenomic resolution of a model system as well as first insights into the origins of its adaptation to cold. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {With the looming threat of abrupt ecological disruption due to a changing climate, predicting which species are most vulnerable to environmental change is critical. The life-history of a species is an evolved response to its environmental context, and therefore a promising candidate for explaining differences in climate-change responses. However, we need broad empirical assessments from across the worlds ecosystems to explore the link between life-history and climate-change responses. Here, we use long-term abundance records from 157 species of terrestrial mammal and a two-step Bayesian meta-regression framework to investigate the link between annual weather anomalies, population growth rates, and species-level life-history. Overall, we found no directional effect of temperature or precipitation anomalies or variance on annual population growth rates. Furthermore, population responses to weather anomalies were not predicted by phylogenetic covariance, and instead there was more variability in weather responses for populations within a species. Crucially, however, long-lived mammals with smaller litter sizes had smaller absolute population responses to weather anomalies compared to their shorter-living counterparts with larger litters. These results highlight the role of species-level life-history in driving responses to the environment. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Sustainable maize production under changing climatic conditions, especially heat and water stress conditions is one of the key challenges that need to be addressed immediately. The current field study was designed to evaluate the impact of water stress on morpho-physiological, biochemical, reactive oxygen species, antioxidant activity and kernel quality traits at different plant growth stages in maize hybrids. Four indigenous i.e., YH-5427, YH-5482, YH-5395, JPL-1908, and one multinational maize hybrid i.e., NK-8441 (Syngenta Seeds) were used for the study. Four stress treatments (i) Control (ii) 3-week water stress at pre-flowering stage (iii) 3-week water stress at anthesis stage (iv) 3-week water stress at grain filling/post-anthesis stage. The presence of significant oxidative stress was revealed by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROXs) i.e., H2O2 (1.9 to 5.8 µmole g−1 FW) and malondialdehyde (120.5 to 169.0 nmole g−1 FW) leading to severe negative impacts on kernel yield. Moreover, a severe reduction in photosynthetic ability (50.6%, from 34.0 to 16.8 µmole m−2 s−1), lower transpirational rate (31.3%, from 3.2 to 2.2 mmol m−2 s−1), alterations in plant anatomy, reduced pigments stability, and deterioration of kernel quality was attributed to water stress. Water stress affected all the three studied growth stages, the pre-flowering stage being the most vulnerable while the post-anthesis stage was the least affected stage to drought stress. Antioxidant activity was observed to increase under all stress conditions in all maize hybrids, however, the highest antioxidant activity was recorded at the anthesis stage and in maize hybrids YH-5427 i.e., T-SOD activity was increased by 61.3% from 37.5 U mg−1 pro to 60.5 U mg−1 pro while CAT activity was maximum under water stress conditions 8.3 U mg−1 pro as compared to 10.3 U mg−1 pro under control (19.3%). The overall performance of maize hybrid YH-5427 was much more promising than other hybrids, attributed to its higher photosynthetic activity, and better antioxidant defense mechanism. Therefore, this hybrid could be recommended for cultivation in drought-prone areas. Copyright 2023 Yousaf et al.},

	abstract = {Background. The African continent is comprised of several different biomes, although savanna is the most prevalent. The current heterogeneous landscape was formed through long-term vegetation shifts as a result of the global cooling trend since the Oligocene epoch. The overwhelming trend was a shift from primarily forest, to primarily savanna. As such, faunal groups that emerged during the Paleogene/Neogene period and have species distributed in both forest and savanna habitat should show a genetic signature of the possible evolutionary impact of these biome developments. Crotaphopeltis and Philothamnus (Colubridae) are excellent taxa to investigate the evolutionary impact of these biome developments on widespread African colubrid snakes, and whether timing and patterns of radiation are synchronous with biome reorganisation. Methods. A phylogenetic framework was used to investigate timing of lineage diversification. Phylogenetic analysis included both genera as well as other Colubridae to construct a temporal framework in order to estimate radiation times for Crotaphopeltis and Philothamnus. Lineage diversification was estimated in Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST), using two mitochondrial markers (cyt–b, ND4), one nuclear marker (c–mos), and incorporating one fossil and two biogeographical calibration points. Vegetation layers were used to classify and confirm species association with broad biome types (‘closed’ = forest, ‘open’ = savanna/other), and the ancestral habitat state for each genus was estimated. Results. Philothamnus showed an ancestral state of closed habitat, but the ancestral habitat type for Crotaphopeltis was equivocal. Both genera showed similar timing of lineage diversification diverging from their sister genera during the Oligocene/Miocene transition (ca. 25 Mya), with subsequent species radiation in the Mid-Miocene. Philothamnus appeared to have undergone allopatric speciation during Mid-Miocene forest fragmentation. Habitat generalist and open habitat specialist species emerged as savanna became more prevalent, while at least two forest associated lineages within Crotaphopeltis moved into Afromontane forest habitat secondarily and independently. Discussion. With similar diversification times, but contrasting ancestral habitat reconstructions, we show that these genera have responded very differently to the same broad biome shifts. Differences in biogeographical patterns for the two African colubrid genera is likely an effect of distinct life-history traits, such as the arboreous habits of Philothamnus compared to the terrestrial lifestyle of Crotaphopeltis. © 2021 Engelbrecht et al.},

	abstract = {Background: In the grass family, a disproportionate number of species have been designated as being invasive. Various growth traits have been proposed to explain the invasiveness of grasses; however, the possibility that allelopathy gives invasive grasses a competitive advantage has attracted relatively little attention. Recent research has isolated plant allelochemicals that are mostly specific to the grass family that can breakdown into relatively stable, toxic byproducts. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies on grass allelopathy to test three prominent hypotheses from invasion biology and competition theory: (1) on native recipients, non-native grasses will have a significantly more negative effect compared to native grasses (Novel Weapons Hypothesis); (2) among native grasses, their effect on non-native recipients will be significantly more negative compared to their effect on native recipients (Biotic Resistance Hypothesis); and (3) allelopathic impacts will increase with phylogenetic distance (Phylogenetic Distance Hypothesis). From 23 studies, we gathered a dataset of 524 observed effect sizes (delta log response ratios) measuring the allelopathic impact of grasses on growth and germination of recipient species, and we used non-linear mixed-effects Bayesian modeling to test the hypotheses. Results: We found support for the Novel Weapons Hypothesis: on native recipients, non-native grasses were twice as suppressive as native grasses (22% vs 11%, respectively). The Phylogenetic Distance Hypothesis was supported by our finding of a significant correlation between phylogenetic distance and allelopathic impact. The Biotic Resistance Hypothesis was not supported. Overall, this meta-analysis adds to the evidence that allelochemicals may commonly contribute to successful or high impact invasions in the grass family. Increased awareness of the role of allelopathy in soil legacy effects associated with grass invasions may improve restoration outcomes through implementation of allelopathy-informed restoration practices. Examples of allelopathy-informed practices, and the knowledge needed to utilize them effectively, are discussed, including the use of activated carbon to neutralize allelochemicals and modify the soil microbial community.

	abstract = {Ornamentation is typically observed in sexually mature adults, is often dimorphic in expression, and is most apparent during breeding, supporting a role for sexual selection in its evolution.1–4 Yet, increasing evidence suggests that nonsexual social selection may also have a role in the evolution of ornamentation, especially in females.5–9 Distinguishing between these alternatives remains challenging because sexual and nonsexual factors may both play important and overlapping roles in trait evolution.7,10 Here, we show that female ornamentation in a dichromatic hummingbird, the white-necked jacobin (Florisuga mellivora), cannot be explained by sexual selection. Although all males are ornamented, nearly 30% of females have male-like plumage. Remarkably, all juveniles of both sexes express ornamented plumage similar to adult males (androchromatism), but 80% of females acquire non-ornamented plumage (heterochromatism) as they age. This unique ontogeny excludes competition for mates as an explanation for female ornamentation because non-reproductive juveniles are more likely to be ornamented than adults. Instead, avoidance of social harassment appears to underlie this female-limited polymorphism, as heterochrome taxidermy mounts received more aggressive and sexual attention than androchrome mounts from this and other hummingbird species. Monitoring electronically tagged birds at data-logging feeders showed that androchrome females accessed feeders more than heterochrome females, presumably because of reduced harassment. Our findings demonstrate that ornamentation can arise purely through nonsexual social selection, and this hypothesis must be considered in the evolution of not only female-limited polymorphism but also the spectacular ornamentation often assumed to result from sexual selection. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background. Host-gut microbiota interactions are complex and can have a profound impact on the ecology and evolution of both counterparts. Several host traits such as systematics, diet and social behavior, and external factors such as prey availability and local environment are known to influence the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota. Methods. In this study, we investigate the influence of systematics, sex, host size, and locality/habitat on gut microbiota diversity in five lizard species from two different sites in Portugal: Podarcis bocagei and Podarcis lusitanicus, living in syntopy in a rural area in northern Portugal (Moledo); the invasive Podarcis siculus and the native Podarcis virescens, living in sympatry in an urbanized environment (Lisbon); and the invasive Teira dugesii also living in an urban area (Lisbon). We also infer the potential microbial transmission occurring between species living in sympatry and syntopy. To achieve these goals, we use a metabarcoding approach to characterize the bacterial communities from the cloaca of lizards, sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA. Results. Habitat/locality was an important factor explaining differences in gut bacterial composition and structure, with species from urbanized environments having higher bacterial diversity. Host systematics (i.e., species) influenced gut bacterial community structure only in lizards from the urbanized environment. We also detected a significant positive correlation between lizard size and gut bacterial alpha-diversity in the invasive species P. siculus, which could be due to its higher exploratory behavior. Moreover, estimates of bacterial transmission indicate that P. siculus may have acquired a high proportion of local microbiota after its introduction. These findings confirm that a diverse array of host and environmental factors can influence lizards' gut microbiota. Copyright © 2023 Vasconcelos et al.},

	abstract = {Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important agricultural plants wearing abiotic stresses, such as water deficit and cold, that cause its productivity reduction. Since resistance to abiotic factors is a multigenic trait, therefore modern genome-wide approaches can help to involve various genetic material in breeding. One technique is full transcriptome analysis that reveals groups of stress response genes serving marker-assisted selection markers. Comparing transcriptome profiles of the same genetic material under several stresses is essential and makes the whole picture. Here, we addressed this by studying the transcriptomic response to water deficit and cold stress for two evolutionarily distant bread wheat varieties: stress-resistant cv. Saratovskaya 29 (S29) and stress-sensitive cv. Yanetzkis Probat (YP). For the first time, transcriptomes for these cultivars grown under abiotic stress conditions were obtained using Illumina based MACE technology. We identified groups of genes involved in response to cold and water deficiency stresses, including responses to each stress factor and both factors simultaneously that may be candidates for resistance genes. We discovered a core group of genes that have a similar pattern of stress-induced expression changes. The particular expression pattern was revealed not only for the studied varieties but also for the published transcriptomic data on cv. Jing 411 and cv. Fielder. Comparative transcriptome profiling of cv. S29 and cv. YP in response to water deficit and cold stress confirmed the hypothesis that stress-induced expression change is unequal within a homeologous gene group. As a rule, at least one changed significantly while the others had a relatively lower expression. Also, we found several SNPs distributed throughout the genomes of cv. S29 and cv. YP and distinguished the studied varieties from each other and the reference cv. Chinese Spring. Our results provide new data for genomics-assisted breeding of stress-tolerant wheat cultivars. © 2021 Konstantinov et al.},

Despite being caused by diverse pathogens, children with sepsis are clinically indistinguishable from one another. In spite of this, most genetic susceptibility loci for invasive infection that have been discovered to date are pathogen specific and are not therefore suggestive of a shared genetic architecture of bacterial sepsis. Here we utilise probabilistic diagnostic models to identify children with a high probability of invasive bacterial disease among critically unwell Kenyan children with P. falciparum parasitaemia. We construct a joint dataset including 1,445 bacteraemia cases and 1,143 severe malaria cases, and population controls, among critically unwell Kenyan children that have previously been genotyped for human genetic variation. Using these data we perform a cross-trait genome-wide association study of invasive bacterial infection, weighting cases according to their probability of bacterial disease. In doing so we identify and validate a novel risk locus for invasive infection secondary to multiple bacterial pathogens, that has no apparent effect on malaria risk. The locus identified modifies splicing of BIRC6 in stimulated monocytes, implicating regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in the pathogenesis of sepsis in Kenyan children. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

Here we present results from a large-scale experimental assessment of coral bleaching resistance, a critical trait for coral population persistence as oceans warm, in 221 colonies of the coral Acropora hyacinthus across 37 reefs in Palau. We find that bleaching resistant individuals inhabit most reefs but are found more often in warmer microhabitats. Our survey also found wide variation in symbiont concentration among colonies, and that colonies with lower symbiont load tended to be more bleaching resistant. By contrast, our data show that low symbiont load comes at the cost of lower growth rate, a tradeoff that may operate widely among corals across environments. Corals with high bleaching resistance have been suggested as a source for habitat restoration or selective breeding in order to increase coral reef resilience to climate change. Our maps show where these resilience corals can be found, but the existence of tradeoffs with heat resistance may suggest caution in unilateral use of this one trait in restoration. © 2021, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: Large-scale changes in habitat conditions due to human modifications and climate change require management practices to consider how species communities can alter amidst these changes. Understanding species interactions across the gradient of space, anthropogenic pressure, and season provide the opportunity to anticipate possible dynamics in the changing scenarios. We studied the interspecific interactions of carnivore species in a high-altitude ecosystem over seasonal (summer and winter) and resource gradients (livestock grazing) to assess the impact of changing abiotic and biotic settings on coexistence. Methods: The study was conducted in the Upper Bhagirathi basin, Western Himalaya, India. We analyzed around 4 years of camera trap monitoring data to understand seasonal spatial and temporal interactions of the snow leopard with common leopard and woolly wolf were assessed in the greater and trans-Himalayan habitats, respectively. We used two species occupancy models to assess spatial interactions, and circadian activity patterns were used to assess seasonal temporal overlap amongst carnivores. In addition, we examined scats to understand the commonalities in prey selection. Results: The result showed that although snow leopard and wolves depend on the same limited prey species and show high temporal overlap, habitat heterogeneity and differential habitat use facilitate co-occurrence between these two predators. Snow leopard and common leopard were spatially independent in the summer. Conversely, the common leopard negatively influences the space use of snow leopard in the winter. Limited prey resources (lack of livestock), restricted space (due to snow cover), and similar activity patterns in winter might result in strong competition, causing these species to avoid each other on a spatial scale. The study showed that in addition to species traits and size, ecological settings also play a significant role in deciding the intensity of competition between large carnivores. Climate change and habitat shifts are predicted to increase the spatial overlap between snow leopard and co-predators in the future. In such scenarios, wolves and snow leopards may coexist in a topographically diverse environment, provided sufficient prey are available. However, shifts in tree line might lead to severe competition between common leopards and snow leopards, which could be detrimental to the latter. Further monitoring of resource use across abiotic and biotic environments may improve our understanding of how changing ecological conditions can affect resource partitioning between snow leopards and predators.  © 2022 Pal et al.},

	abstract = {Estuaries are one of the most productive ecosystems and their productivity is maintained by resident microbial communities. Recent alterations driven by climate change have further escalated these stressors leading to the propagation of traits such as antibiotic resistance and heavy metal resistance in microbial communities. Surface water samples from eleven stations along the Thakuran and Matla estuaries of the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) of Sundarbans mangrove located in South Asia were sampled in monsoon (June) 2019 to elucidate resident microbial communities based on Nanopore sequencing. Metagenomic analyses revealed the widespread dominance of Proteobacteria across all the stations along with a high abundance of Firmicutes. Other phyla, including Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria showed site-specific trends in abundance. Further taxonomic affiliations showed Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria to be dominant classes with high abundances of Bacilli in SBR_Stn58 and SBR_Stn113. Among the eukaryotic communities, the most abundant classes included Prasinophyceae, Saccharyomycetes and Sardariomycetes. Functional annotation showed metabolic activities such as carbohydrate, amino acid, nitrogen and phosphorus metabolisms to be uniformly distributed across all the studied stations. Pathways such as stress response, sulphur metabolism and motilityassociated genes appeared in low abundances in SBR. Functional traits such as antibiotic resistance showed overwhelming dominance of genes involved in multidrug resistance along with widespread resistance towards commonly used antibiotics including Tetracycline, glycopeptide and aminoglycoside. Metal resistance genes including arsenic, nickel and copper were found in comparable abundances across the studied stations. The prevalence of ARG and MRG might indicate presence of pollutants and hint toward deteriorating ecosystem health status of Sundarbans mangrove. © 2022 Ghosh et al.},

	abstract = {Changes in environmental conditions are likely to have a complex effect on the growth of plants, their phenology, plant-pollinator interactions, and reproductive success. The current world is facing an ongoing climate change along with other human-induced environmental changes. Most research has focused on the impact of increasing temperature as a major driving force for climate change, but other factors may have important impacts on plant traits and pollination too and these effects may vary from season to season. In addition, it is likely that the effects of multiple environmental factors, such as increasing temperature, water availability, and nitrogen enrichment are not independent. Therefore, we tested the impact of two key factors—water, and nitrogen supply—on plant traits, pollination, and seed production in Sinapis alba (Brassicaceae) in three seasons defined as three temperature conditions with two levels of water and nitrogen supply in a factorial design. We collected data on multiple vegetative and floral traits and assessed the response of pollinators in the field. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of growing conditions on seed set in plants exposed to pollinators and in hand-pollinated plants. Our results show that water stress impaired vegetative growth, decreased flower production, and reduced visitation by pollinators and seed set, while high amount of nitrogen increased nectar production under low water availability in plants grown in the spring. Temperature modulated the effect of water and nitrogen availability on vegetative and floral traits and strongly affected flowering phenology and flower production. We demonstrated that changes in water and nitrogen availability alter plant vegetative and floral traits, which impacts flower visitation and consequently plant reproduction. We conclude that ongoing environmental changes such as increasing temperature, altered precipitation regimes and nitrogen enrichment may thus affect plant-pollinator interactions with negative consequences for the reproduction of wild plants and insect-pollinated crops.

	abstract = {Drought stress has devastating impacts on faba bean production, particularly with the current abrupt climate changes in arid environments. Hence, it is essential to identify drought-tolerant genotypes. The present study aimed at assessing six faba bean genotypes under three irrigation levels during two winter successive growing seasons (2018/2019 and 2019/2020). The applied irrigation levels were well-watered (every 4 days (D1), moderate drought every 8 days (D2), and severe drought 12 days (D3)) regimes. The analysis of variance exhibited highly significant differences among genotypes, irrigation treatments, and their interactions for all studied traits, except the number of pods plant-1 in the first season. Yield traits of all assessed genotypes decreased significantly with increasing drought stress. Otherwise, proline content (Pro) increased significantly with increasing drought stress. The genotypes Giza.843, Nubaria.2, and Nubaria.3 recorded the highest values of plant height, number of branches/plant, pods/plant, pods weight/plant, 100 seed weight, seed yield/plant, and seed yield/kg under drought stress. Similarly, the highest Pro was displayed by Giza.843 and Nubaria.3 under drought stress in both seasons. Furthermore, Giza.843, Nubaria.2, and Nubaria.3 genotypes had the highest values for most tolerant indices. Accordingly, these genotypes could be exploited in developing drought-tolerant and high-yielding faba bean genotypes in arid environments through breeding programs.  © 2022 Manal S.

LAB were screened using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indole-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) and O-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopy ranoside (ONPG) as substrate, and exhibited β-galactosidase activity ranging from 728.25 to 1,203.32 Miller units. The most promising isolates were selected for 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and identified as Lactiplantibacillus plan-tarum, Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lactiplantibacillus pentosus and Lactiplantibacillus sp. Furthermore, these isolates were evaluated by in vitro, viz., survival in gastrointestinal tract, antibiotic susceptibility, antimicrobial activity, cell surface characteristics, and haemolytic activity.

	abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an essential staple food crop, but the per acre average rice yield is less than its substantial potential in many countries. Rice breeders and growers would benefit from a robust genotypes with better morpho-physiological and yield-related traits. Here, seventy-four new rice genotypes were phenotyped over two years for their gas exchange and yield potential-related traits under Mississippi rice-growing conditions. A wide range of variability was observed among genotypes for all measured traits. Detailed phenotyping of rice genotypes revealed two key relationships that function together to contribute to yield potential under the southern US climate. The first one, grain yield, grain number, and spikelet fertility, showed considerable correlation (r = 0.45 to 0.79, p < 0.001) to harvest index. Conversely, days to anthesis had a high and negative correlation with harvest index (r = -0.79, p < 0.001), which suggests that selection for short duration genotypes with efficient partitioning could improve the yields under southern US climatic conditions. Additive response index revealed a higher positive association with yield traits (R2= 0.59) than physiological (R2= 0.28) and morphological traits (R2= 0.21). Compared with the commercial genotype Rex, 21.6% and 47.3% of the rice genotypes had a higher gas exchange and yield response scores. IR08A172, IR07K142 and IR07F287 were ranked as high performers in physiological and yield response indices. Our study highlights that selection for short-duration yield-related traits with efficient sink capacity traits is desirable for future breeding programs. © 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma, frequently invade as multicellular units. However, these invading units can be organised in a variety of ways, ranging from thin discontinuous strands to thick ‘pushing’ collectives. Here we employ an integrated experimental and computational approach to identify the factors that determine the mode of collective cancer cell invasion. We find that matrix proteolysis is linked to the formation of wide strands but has little effect on the maximum extent of invasion. Cell-cell junctions also favour wide strands, but our analysis also reveals a requirement for cell-cell junctions for efficient invasion in response to uniform directional cues. Unexpectedly, the ability to generate wide invasive strands is coupled to the ability to grow effectively when surrounded by extracellular matrix in three-dimensional assays. Combinatorial perturbation of both matrix proteolysis and cell-cell adhesion demonstrates that the most aggressive cancer behaviour, both in terms of invasion and growth, is achieved at high levels of cell-cell adhesion and high levels of proteolysis. Contrary to expectation, cells with canonical mesenchymal traits – no cell-cell junctions and high proteolysis – exhibit reduced growth and lymph node metastasis. Thus, we conclude that the ability of squamous cell carcinoma cells to invade effectively is also linked to their ability to generate space for proliferation in confined contexts. These data provide an explanation for the apparent advantage of retaining cell-cell junctions in squamous cell carcinomas. © Kato, Jenkins et al.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is one of the major constraints for crop growth and development, owing to low availability and least mobility in many tropical soil conditions. Categorization of existing germplasm under P deficient conditions is a prerequisite for the selection and development of P efficient genotypes in the mungbean. In the present investigation, 36 diverse genotypes were categorized for phosphorus use efficiency traits using four different techniques for identification of phosphorus use efficient mungbean genotypes. The studied genotypes were categorized for P efficiency based on efficiency, responsiveness, and stress tolerance score of genotypes under normal and low P conditions. The mean values of traits, root dry mass, root to shoot ratio, and P utilization efficiency are significantly higher under low P conditions indicating the high responsiveness of traits to P deficiency. The presence of significant interaction between genotypes and P treatment indicates the evaluated genotypes were significantly affected by P treatment for studied traits. The total P uptake showed significant and positive correlations with root dry mass, shoot dry mass, total dry mass,and P concentration under both P regimes. Out of the four techniques used for the categorization of genotypes for P efficiency, three techniques revealed that the genotype PUSA 1333, followed by Pusa Vishal, PUSA 1031, and Pusa Ratna is efficient. The categorization based on stress tolerance score is the finest way to study variation and for the selection of contrasting genotypes for P efficiency. The identified P efficient genotypes would be valuable resources for genetic enhancement of P use efficiency in mungbean breeding. © 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.},

Based on the morphological study and molecular analysis, three species were recognized, P. aletaiensis, P. brunneidiscus, and P. hongoi. Pluteus aletaiensis is proposed as a new species. It is characterized by its bright yellow lamellae and stipe, brittle texture, subfusiform to vesicular pleurocystidia, with short pedicels to broadly lageniform to obtuse at apices, a hymeniderm pileipellis, containing dark brown intracellular pigment, and it grows on the ground. Pluteus brunneidiscus, a new record to China, is characterized by uneven, smooth, grayish brown to brown pileus, with an entire margin, and pointed or flatter apices intermediate cystidia, without apical hooks. Pluteus hongoi, a new record to Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China, is characterized by the apical hook’s structure (commonly bifid) of pleurocystidia. The nuclear internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1-a) region were used for the molecular analysis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using both the maximum likelihood analysis (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI). Detailed descriptions of the three species are presented herein. Finally, a key to the list of eight species of the genus Pluteus knew from Xinjiang is provided. DOI 10.7717/peerj.14298.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of host-parasite interactions are highly temperature-dependent and may be modified by increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven heat events. Here, we show that altered patterns of temperature variance lead to an almost order-of-magnitude shift in thermal performance of host and pathogen life-history traits over and above the effects of mean temperature and, moreover, that different temperature regimes affect these traits differently. We found that diurnal fluctuations of ±3°C lowered infection rates and reduced spore burden compared to constant temperatures in our focal host Daphnia magna exposed to the microsporidium parasite Ordospora colligata. In contrast, a 3-day heatwave (+6°C) did not affect infection rates, but increased spore burden (relative to constant temperatures with the same mean) at 16°C, while reducing burden at higher temperatures. We conclude that changing patterns of climate variation, superimposed on shifts in mean temperatures due to global warming, may have profound and unan-ticipated effects on disease dynamics. © Kunze et al.},

	abstract = {Plant hybridization is an important breeding technique essential for producing a genotype (hybrid) with favorable traits (e.g., stress tolerance, pest resistance, high yield potential etc.) to increase agronomic, economic and commercial values. Studying of genetic dominance among the population helps to determine gene action, heritability and candidate gene selection for plant breeding program. Therefore, this investigation was aimed to evaluate gene action, heritability, genetic advance and heterosis of rice root, agronomic, and yield component traits under water deficit conditions. In this study, crossing was performed among the four different water-deficit tolerant rice genotypes to produce better hybrid (F1), segregating (F2) and back-cross (BC1 and BC2) populations. The Giza 178, WAB56-204, and Sakha104 × WAB56-104 populations showed the better physiological and agronomical performances, which provided better adaptability of the populations to water deficit condition. Additionally, the estimation of heterosis and heterobeltiosis of some quantitative traits in rice populations were also studied. The inheritance of all studied traits was influenced by additive gene actions. Dominance gene actions played a major role in controlling the genetic variance among studied traits in both crossed populations under well-watered and drought conditions. The additive × additive type of gene interactions was essential for the inheritance of root length, root/shoot ratio, 1,000-grain weight, and sterility % of two crossed populations under both conditions. On the contrary, the additive × dominance type of gene interactions was effective in the inheritance of all studied traits, except duration in Giza178 × Sakha106, and plant height in Sakha104 × WAB56-104 under water deficit condition. In both crosses, the dominance × dominance type of gene interactions was effective in the inheritance of root volume, root/shoot ratio, number of panicles/plant and 1,000-grain weight under both conditions. Moreover, dominance × dominance type of gene interaction played a major role in the inheritance of root length, number of roots/plant, plant height, panicle length, number of filled grain/panicle and grain yield/plant in Giza178 × Sakha106 under both conditions. The studied traits in both crossed populations indicated better genetic advance as they showed advanced qualitative and quantitative characters in rice populations under water deficit condition. Overall, our findings open a new avenue of future phenotypic and genotypic association studies in rice. These insights might be useful to the plant breeders and farmers for developing water deficit tolerant rice cultivars. Copyright 2023 Hassan et al.},

	abstract = {Farmers and breeders aim to improve crop responses to abiotic stresses and secure yield under adverse environmental conditions. To achieve this goal and select the most resilient genotypes, plant breeders and researchers rely on phenotyping to quantify crop responses to abiotic stress. Recent advances in imaging technologies allow researchers to collect physiological data non-destructively and throughout time, making it possible to dissect complex plant responses into quantifiable traits. The use of image-based technologies enables the quantification of crop responses to stress in both controlled environmental conditions and field trials. This paper summarizes phenotyping imaging technologies (RGB, multispectral and hyperspectral sensors, among others) that have been used to assess different abiotic stresses including salinity, drought and nitrogen deficiency, while discussing their advantages and drawbacks. We present a detailed review of traits involved in abiotic tolerance, which have been quantified by a range of imaging sensors under high-throughput phenotyping facilities or using unmanned aerial vehicles in the field. We also provide an up-to-date compilation of spectral tolerance indices and discuss the progress and challenges in machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised models as well as deep learning. © 2022 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Disturbances are crucial in determining forest biodiversity, dynamics, and ecosystem functions. Surface fire is a significant disturbance in tropical forests, but research on the effect of surface fire on structuring species and functional composition in a community through time remains scarce. Using a 20-year dataset of tree demography in a seasonal evergreen tropical forest in Thailand, we specifically addressed two essential questions: (1) What is the pattern of temporal turnover in species and functional composition in a community with frequent fire disturbance? (2) How did the temporal turnover vary with tree size? Methods: We analyzed species compositional and functional temporal turnovers in four different tree size classes among five tree censuses. We quantified species turnover by calculating Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and investigated its underlying mechanisms by comparing pairwise dissimilarity of functional traits with simulations from null models. If fire disturbances contribute more to a stochastic process, the functional composition would display a random pattern. However, if they contribute more towards a deterministic process, the functional composition should reveal a non-random pattern. Results: Over 20 years (1994-2014), we observed changes in species composition, whereas functional composition remained relatively stable. The temporal turnover patterns of species and functional compositions varied with tree sizes. In particular, temporal functional turnover shifted very little for large trees, suggesting that changes in species composition of larger trees are contributed by species with similar functional traits through time. The temporal functional composition turnovers of smaller trees (DBH ≤ 5 cm) were mostly at random. We detected a higher functional turnover than expected by null models in some quadrats throughout the 50-ha study plot, and their observed turnover varied with diameter classes. Conclusions: Species compositional changes were caused by changes in the abundance of species with similar functional traits through time. Temporal functional turnover in small trees was random in most quadrats, suggesting that the recruits came from the equal proportions of surviving trees and new individuals of fast-growing species, which increased rapidly after fires. On the other hand, functional composition in big trees was more likely determined by surviving trees which maintained higher functional similarities than small trees through time. Fire disturbance is important for ecosystem functions, as changing forest fire frequency may alter forest turnover, particularly in functional composition in the new recruits of this forest. © 2022 Kaewsong et al.},

	abstract = {Background. At any particular location, frequencies of alleles that are associated with adaptive traits are expected to change in future climates through local adaption and migration, including assisted migration (human-implemented when climate change is more rapid than natural migration rates). Making the assumption that the baseline frequencies of alleles across environmental gradients can act as a predictor of patterns in changed climates (typically future but possibly paleo-climates), a methodology is provided by AlleleShift of predicting changes in allele frequencies at the population level. Methods. The prediction procedure involves a first calibration and prediction step through redundancy analysis (RDA), and a second calibration and prediction step through a generalized additive model (GAM) with a binomial family. As such, the procedure is fundamentally different to an alternative approach recently proposed to predict changes in allele frequencies from canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The RDA step is based on the Euclidean distance that is also the typical distance used in Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA). Because the RDA step or CCA approach sometimes predict negative allele frequencies, the GAM step ensures that allele frequencies are in the range of 0 to 1. Results. AlleleShift provides data sets with predicted frequencies and several visualization methods to depict the predicted shifts in allele frequencies from baseline to changed climates. These visualizations include `dot plot' graphics (function shift.dot.ggplot ), pie diagrams (shift.pie.ggplot ), moon diagrams (shift.moon.ggplot ), `waffle' diagrams (shift.waffle.ggplot ) and smoothed surface diagrams of allele frequencies of baseline or future patterns in geographical space (shift.surf.ggplot ). As these visualizations were generated through the ggplot2 package, methods of generating animations for a climate change time series are straightforward, as shown in the documentation of AlleleShift and in the supplemental videos. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

	abstract = {Plants have a complex system of stress response that deals with different types of stresses. Maize (Zea mays L.), one of the most important crops grown throughout the world, across a range of agro-ecological environments, employs complex mechanisms of gene regulation in response to drought stress. HKI 335 is a tropical maize inbred line showing remarkable adaptation to drought stress. Abiotic stresses, like drought, trigger the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to the incomplete reduction or excitation of molecular oxygen, eventually leading to cell damage. Superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) is a metalloenzyme that acts as the first line of defense against ROS. We cloned the Sod2 gene from HKI 335 inbred line and analyzed its protein through detailed in silico characterization. Our comparative modeling revealed that at the level of tertiary structure, the HKI 335 SOD2 protein is highly similar to Potentilla atrosanguinea SOD2, which had been previously identified as highly thermostable SOD that can tolerate autoclaving as well as sub-zero temperatures. We performed phylogenetic analysis, estimated physicochemical properties, post-translational modifications, protein-protein interactions, and domain composition of this SOD2. The phylogenetic analysis showed that orthologous sequences of SOD from different species were clustered into two clusters. Secondary structure prediction indicates that SOD2 is a soluble protein and no transmembrane domains have been found. Most of the beta sheets have RSA value greater than 2. The Ramachandran plot from PDBsum revealed that most of the residues fall in the highly favored region. It was estimated that the value of the instability index was less than 40, the value of the aliphatic index was extremely high and the GRAVY value lies between −2 and +2. We could identify only one phosphorylation site, located at position 20 with a score of 0.692. Overall, the unique stress-tolerant properties of the HKI 335 SOD2, may be one of the reasons contributing to the high drought tolerance trait exhibited by HKI 335 maize inbred line. Further research may reveal more insights into the drought adaptation mechanism in maize and the eventual deployment of the trait in maize hybrids. 2023 Gautam et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Invasive species are one of the key elements of human-mediated ecosystem degradation and ecosystem services impairment worldwide. Dispersal of propagules is the first stage of plant species spread and strongly influences the dynamics of biological invasion. Therefore, distance prediction for invasive species spread is critical for invasion management. Heracleum sosnowskyi is one of the most dangerous invasive species with wind-dispersed propagules (seeds) across Eastern Europe. This study developed a simple mechanistic model for H. sosnowskyi propagule dispersal and their distances with an accuracy comparable to that of empirical measurements. Methods. We measured and compared the propagule traits (terminal velocity, mass, area, and wing loading) and release height for H. sosnowskyi populations from two geographically distant regions of European Russia. We tested two simple mechanistic models: a ballistic model and a wind gradient model using identical artificial propagules. The artificial propagules were made of colored paper with a mass, area, wing loading, and terminal velocity close to those of natural H. sosnowskyi mericarps. Results. The wind gradient model produced the best results. The first calculations of maximum possible propagule transfer distance by wind using the model and data from weather stations showed that the role of wind as a vector of long-distance dispersal for invasive Heracleum species was strongly underestimated. The published dataset with H. sosnowskyi propagule traits and release heights allows for modeling of the propagules' dispersal distances by wind at any geographical point within their entire invasion range using data from the closest weather stations. The proposed simple model for the prediction of H. sosnowskyi propagule dispersal by wind may be included in planning processes for managing invasion of this species. © 2021 Chadin et al.

	abstract = {A fast and reliable method for obtaining a species-level identification is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of activities, from plant protection and invasive species management to biodiversity assessments and ecological studies. For insects, novel molecular techniques such as DNA metabarcoding have emerged as a rapid alternative to traditional morphological identification, reducing the dependence on limited taxonomic experts. Until recently, molecular techniques have required a destructive DNA extraction, precluding the possibility of preserving voucher specimens for future studies, or species descriptions. Here we paired insect metabarcoding with two recent non-destructive DNA extraction protocols, to obtain a rapid and high-throughput taxonomic identification of diverse insect taxa while retaining a physical voucher specimen. The aim of this work was to explore how non-destructive extraction protocols impact the semi-quantitative nature of metabarcoding, which alongside species presence/absence also provides a quantitative, but biased, representation of their relative abundances. By using a series of mock communities representing each stage of a typical metabarcoding workflow we were able to determine how different morphological (i.e., insect biomass and exoskeleton hardness) and molecular traits (i.e., primer mismatch and amplicon GC%), interact with different protocol steps to introduce quantitative bias into non-destructive metabarcoding results. We discuss the relevance of taxonomic bias to metabarcoding identification of insects and potential approaches to account for it. Copyright 2022 Martoni et al.},

	abstract = {Predator-prey interactions influence prey traits through both consumptive and non-consumptive effects, and variation in these traits can shape vector-borne disease dynamics. Meta-analysis methods were employed to generate predation effect sizes by different categories of predators and mosquito prey. This analysis showed that multiple families of aquatic predators are effective in consumptively reducing mosquito survival, and that the survival of Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex mosquitoes is negatively impacted by consumptive effects of predators. Mosquito larval size was found to play a more important role in explaining the heterogeneity of consumptive effects from predators than mosquito genus. Mosquito survival and body size were reduced by non-consumptive effects of predators, but development time was not significantly impacted. In addition, Culex vectors demonstrated predator avoidance behavior during oviposition. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that predators limit disease transmission by reducing both vector survival and vector size, and that associations between drought and human West Nile virus cases could be driven by the vector behavior of predator avoidance during oviposition. These findings are likely to be useful to infectious disease modelers who rely on vector traits as predictors of transmission. © Russell et al.},

	abstract = {Marine plastic debris (MPD) are a global threat to marine ecosystems. Among countless ecosystem impacts, MPD can serve as a vector for marine ‘hitchhikers’ by facilitating transport and subsequent spread of unwanted pests and pathogens. The transport and spread of these non-indigenous species (NIS) can have substantial impacts on native biodiversity, ecosystem services/functions and hence, important economic consequences. Over the past decade, increasing research interest has been directed towards the characterization of biological communities colonizing plastic debris, the so called Plastisphere. Despite remarkable advances in this field, little is known regarding the recruitment patterns of NIS larvae and propagules on MPD, and the factors influencing these patterns. To address this knowledge gap, we used custom-made bioassay chambers and ran four consecutive bioassays to compare the settlement patterns of four distinct model biofouling organisms’ larvae, including the three notorious invaders Crassostrea gigas, Ciona savignyi and Mytilus galloprovincialis, along with one sessile macro-invertebrate Spirobranchus cariniferus, on three different types of polymers, namely Low-Linear Density Polyethylene (LLDPE), Polylactic Acid (PLA), Nylon-6, and a glass control. Control bioassay chambers were included to investigate the microbial community composition colonizing the different substrates using 16S rRNA metabarcoding. We observed species-specific settlement patterns, with larvae aggregating on different locations on the substrates. Furthermore, our results revealed that C. savignyi and S. cariniferus generally favoured Nylon and PLA, whereas no specific preferences were observed for C. gigas and M. galloprovincialis. We did not detect significant differences in bacterial community composition between the tested substrates. Taken together, our results highlight the complexity of interactions between NIS larvae and plastic polymers. We conclude that several factors and their potential interactions influenced the results of this investigation, including: (i) species-specific larval biological traits and ecology; (ii) physical and chemical composition of the substrates; and (iii) biological cues emitted by bacterial biofilm and the level of chemosensitivity of the different NIS larvae. To mitigate the biosecurity risks associated with drifting plastic debris, additional research effort is critical to effectively decipher the mechanisms involved in the recruitment of NIS on MPD.

	abstract = {Partner switching plays an important role in the evolution of symbiosis, enabling local adaptation and recovery from the breakdown of symbiosis. Because of intergenomic epistasis, partner-switched symbioses may possess novel combinations of phenotypes but may also exhibit low fitness due to their lack of recent coevolutionary history. Here, we examine the structure and mechanisms of intergenomic epistasis in the Paramecium-Chlorella symbiosis and test whether compensatory evolution can rescue initially low fitness partner-switched symbioses. Using partner-switch experiments coupled with metabolomics, we show evidence for intergenomic epistasis wherein low fitness is associated with elevated symbiont stress responses either in dark or high irradiance environments, potentially owing to mismatched light management traits between the host and symbiont genotypes. Experimental evolution under high light conditions revealed that an initially low fitness partner-switched non-native host-symbiont pairing rapidly adapted, gaining fitness equivalent to the native host-symbiont pairing in less than 50 host generations. Compensatory evolution took two alternative routes: either hosts evolved higher symbiont loads to mitigate for their new algal symbiont's poor performance, or the algal symbionts themselves evolved higher investment in photosynthesis and photoprotective traits to better mitigate light stress. These findings suggest that partner switching combined with rapid compensatory evolution can enable the recovery and local adaptation of symbioses in response to changing environments. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impact of marine protected areas on the distribution and composition of fishes is key to the protection and management of coral reef ecosystems, and especially for fish-based activities such as SCUBA diving and recreational fishing. The aim of this research is to compare the ichthyofauna structure in three areas in the eastern part of Los Canarreos archipelago in Cuba with different management schemes: Cayo Campos-Cayo Rosario Fauna Refuge (CCCR), Cayo Largo Ecological Reserve (CL) and non-protected area (nMPA), and considering habitat differences and depth variation. A total of 131 video transects were conducted using diver operated stereo-video (stereo-DOV) in November, 2015 in backreef and forereef along the CCCR, CL and the adjacent nMPA. We recorded 84 species and 27 functional groups suggesting high complementarity of functions. Several multispecies schools were observed along surveys, which explain the biomass peaks in some sites, mainly for Lutjanidae, Haemulidae and Carangidae. A concerning issue was the bare representation of critical functional groups and threatened species. The effect of sites nested within habitats was significant and the most important driver structuring fish assemblages, while MPA condition was not evident. Favorable habitat features (habitat heterogeneity and surrounding coastal ecosystems) are likely enhancing fish assemblages and counteracting the effects of pouching derived from insufficient management. We recommend immediate actions within a strategy of precautionary management including, but not limited to, the appointment of staff for the administration of CL, frequent monitoring and effective enforcement.

	abstract = {While various sources increasingly release nutrients to the Red Sea, knowledge about their effects on benthic coral reef communities is scarce. Here, we provide the first comparative assessment of the response of all major benthic groups (hard and soft corals, turf algae and reef sands-together accounting for 80% of the benthic reef community) to in-situ eutrophication in a central Red Sea coral reef. For 8 weeks, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations were experimentally increased 3-fold above environmental background concentrations around natural benthic reef communities using a slow release fertilizer with 15% total nitrogen (N) content. We investigated which major functional groups took up the available N, and how this changed organic carbon (Corg) and N contents using elemental and stable isotope measurements. Findings revealed that hard corals (in their tissue), soft corals and turf algae incorporated fertilizer N as indicated by significant increases in δ15N by 8%, 27% and 28%, respectively. Among the investigated groups, Corg content significantly increased in sediments (+24%) and in turf algae (+33%). Altogether, this suggests that among the benthic organisms only turf algae were limited by N availability and thus benefited most from N addition. Thereby, based on higher Corg content, turf algae potentially gained competitive advantage over, for example, hard corals. Local management should, thus, particularly address DIN eutrophication by coastal development and consider the role of turf algae as potential bioindicator for eutrophication. © 2020 Karcher et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Ecological communities of interacting species analyzed as complex networks have shown that species dependence on their counterparts is more complex than expected at random. As for other potentially mutualistic interactions, ant-plant networks mediated by extrafloral nectar show a nested (asymmetric) structure with a core of generalist species dominating the interaction pattern. Proposed factors structuring ecological networks include encounter probability (e.g., species abundances and habitat heterogeneity), behavior, phylogeny, and body size. While the importance of underlying factors that influence the structure of ant-plant networks have been separately explored, the simultaneous contribution of several biological and ecological attributes inherent to the species, guild or habitat level has not been addressed. Methods. For a tropical seasonal site we recorded (in 48 censuses) the frequency of pairwise ant-plant interactions mediated by extrafloral nectaries (EFN) on different habitats and studied the resultant network structure. We addressed for the first time the role of mechanistic versus neutral determinants at the &grave;fine-grain' structure (pairwise interactions) of ant-plant networks. We explore the simultaneous contribution of several attributes of plant and ant species (i.e., EFN abundance and distribution, ant head length, behavioral dominance and invasive status), and habitat attributes (i.e., vegetation structure) in prevailing interactions as well as in overall network topology (community). Results. Our studied network was highly-nested and non-modular, with core species having high species strengths (higher strength values for ants than plants) and low specialization. Plants had higher dependences on ants than vice versa. We found that habitat heterogeneity in vegetation structure (open vs. shaded habitats) was the main factor explaining network and fine-grain structure, with no evidence of neutral (abundance) effects. Discussion. Core ant species are relevant to most plants species at the network showing adaptations to nectar consumption and deterrent behavior. Thus larger ants interact with more plant species which, together with higher dependence of plants on ants, suggests potential biotic defense at a community scale. In our study site, heterogeneity in the ant-plant interactions among habitats is so prevalent that it emerges at community-level structural properties. High frequency of morphologically diverse and temporarily-active EFNs in all habitats suggests the relevance and seasonality of plant biotic defense provided by ants. The robust survey of ecological interactions and their biological/ecological correlates that we addressed provides insight of the interplay between adaptive-value traits and neutral effects in ecological networks.

	abstract = {Background. The discovery-dominance trade-off is the inverse relationship between the ability of a species to discover resources and the species’ dominance of those resources; a paradigm used to explain species coexistence in ant communities dependent on similar resources. However, factors such as stress (e.g., temperature) or disturbance (e.g., removal of biomass) associated with the change in land use, can modify this tradeoff. Here, we aimed to determine the potential effects of land use change on dominance hierarchy, food preferences and on the discovery-dominance trade-off. Methods. An experiment with baits was used to investigate the dominance hierarchies of ant communities in a temperate mountain habitat in central Mexico. We evaluated the dominance index (DI), food preferences and discovery-dominance trade-offs of ants inhabiting two types of vegetation: a native oak forest and agricultural land resulting from agricultural land use and grazing. Results. The ant communities in both environments were comprised of three species of ants (Monomorium minimum, Myrmica mexicana, and Camponotus picipes pilosulus), four morphospecies (Pheidole sp.1 and Pheidole sp.2, Temnothorax sp. and Lasius sp.) and one genus (Formica spp.). All Formicidae showed values of intermediate to low DI, and this factor did not seem to be influenced by the change in land use. Ants in the modified vegetation (i.e., agricultural land) were found to be numerically greater. Overall, a higher number of visits were registered to the tuna bait, although the duration of foraging events to the honey baits was longer. However, foraging times were dependent on the species considered: the generalized Myrmicinae, M. minimum, the ant species with highest DI, foraged for longer periods of time in the agricultural land and on the tuna bait. Meanwhile, the cold-climate specialist Formica spp., with a lower DI, foraged for longer periods of time in the oak (although not significant) and on the honey bait. We found little evidence of the discovery-dominance trade-off; instead, we found considerable diversity in the strategies used by the different species to access resources. This range of strategies is well represented by the generalized Myrmicinae M. minimum, the cold-climate specialists Formica spp. and Temnothorax sp., and the rare species, as the cold climate specialist Lasius sp. (insinuators). Conclusions. Our evaluation shows that transformation of the original habitat does not appear to affect the hierarchical dominance of the ant communities, but it does affect their food preferences. Species with higher DI values such as the generalized Myrmicinae are more skilled at resource acquisition in modified habitats. Our results suggest that change in land use promotes an increase in the diversity of foraging strategies used by different ant species. This diversity may contribute to resource partitioning which favors coexistence. Copyright 2019 Castillo-Guevara et al.},

	abstract = {Background. The southern California biodiversity hotspot has had a complex geological history, with both plate tectonic forces and sea level changes repeatedly reconfiguring the region, and likely driving both lineage splittings and extinctions. Here we investigate patterns of genetic divergence in two species of slender salamanders (Plethodontidae: Batrachoseps) in this region. The complex geological history in combination with several organismal traits led us to predict that these species harbor multiple ancient mitochondrial lineages endemic to southern California. These species belong to a clade characterized by fine-scale mitochondrial structure, which has been shown to track ancient splits. Both focal species, Batrachoseps major and B. nigriventris, are relatively widely distributed in southern California, and estimated to have persisted there across millions of years. Recently several extralimital populations of Batrachoseps were found in the San Joaquin Valley of California, a former desert area that has been extensively modified for agriculture. The origins of these populations are unknown, but based on morphology, they are hypothesized to result from human-mediated introductions of B. major. Methods. We sequenced the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b from a geographically comprehensive sampling of the mitochondrial lineages of B. major and B. nigriventris that are endemic to southern California. We used phylogenetic analyses to characterize phylogeographic structure and identify mitochondrial contact zones. We also included the San Joaquin Valley samples to test whether they resulted from introductions. We used a bootstrap resampling approach to compare the strength of isolation-by-distance in both Batrachoseps species and four other salamander species with which they co-occur in southern California. Results. The northern lineage of B. major harbors at least eight deeply differentiated, geographically cohesive mitochondrial subclades. We identify geographic contact between many of these mtDNA lineages and some biogeographic features that are concordant with lineage boundaries. Batrachoseps nigriventris also has multiple deeply differentiated clades within the region. Comparative analyses highlight the smaller spatial scales over which mitochondrial divergence accumulates in Batrachoseps relative to most other salamander species in southern California. The extralimital populations of Batrachoseps from the San Joaquin Valley are assigned to B. major and are shown to result from at least two independent introductions from different source populations. We also suggest that B. major on Catalina Island, where it is considered native, may be the result of an introduction. Some of the same traits that facilitate the build-up of deep phylogeographic structure in Batrachoseps likely also contribute to its propensity for introductions, and we anticipate that additional introduced populations will be discovered. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

	abstract = {Chloroplasts are typically inherited from the female parent and are haploid in most angiosperms, but rare intra-individual heteroplasmy in plastid genomes has been reported in plants. Here, we report an example of plastome heteroplasmy and its characteristics in Gentiana tongolensis (Gentianaceae). The plastid genome of G. tongolensis is 145,757 bp in size and is missing parts of petD gene when compared with other Gentiana species. A total of 112 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 31 indels with frequencies of more than 2% were detected in the plastid genome, and most were located in protein coding regions. Most sites with SNP frequencies of more than 10% were located in six genes in the LSC region. After verification via cloning and Sanger sequencing at three loci, heteroplasmy was identified in different individuals. The cause of heteroplasmy at the nucleotide level in plastome of G. tongolensis is unclear from the present data, although biparental plastid inheritance and transfer of plastid DNA seem to be most likely. This study implies that botanists should reconsider the heredity and evolution of chloroplasts and be cautious with using chloroplasts as genetic markers, especially in Gentiana.

	abstract = {Background: Seed coat color is an important horticultural trait in Brassica crops, which is divided into two categories: Brown/black and yellow. Seeds with yellow seed coat color have higher oil quality, higher protein content and lower fiber content. Yellow seed coat color is therefore considered a desirable trait in hybrid breeding of Brassica rapa, Brassica juncea and Brassica napus. Methods: Comprehensive analysis of the abundance transcripts for seed coat color at three development stages by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and corresponding flavonoids compounds by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were carried out in B. rapa. Results: We identified 41,286 unigenes with 4,989 differentially expressed genes between brown seeds (B147) and yellow seeds (B80) at the same development stage. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis identified 19 unigenes associated with the phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, flavone and flavonol biosynthetic pathways as involved in seed coat color formation. Interestingly, expression levels of early biosynthetic genes (BrCHS, BrCHI, BrF3H, BrF3'H and BrFLS) in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway were down-regulated while late biosynthetic genes (BrDFR, BrLDOX and BrBAN) were hardly or not expressed in seeds of B80. At the same time, BrTT8 and BrMYB5 were down-regulated in B80. Results of LC-MS also showed that epicatechin was not detected in seeds of B80. We validated the accuracy of our RNA-seq data by RT-qPCR of nine critical genes. Epicatechin was not detected in seeds of B80 by LC-MS/MS. Conclusions: The expression levels of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes and the relative content of flavonoid biosynthetic pathway metabolites clearly explained yellow seed color formation in B. rapa. This study provides a foundation for further research on the molecular mechanism of seed coat color formation.  © 2021 Ren et al.},

	abstract = {Changing environmental conditions cause changes in the distributions of phenotypic traits in natural populations. However, determining the mechanisms responsible for these changes - and, in particular, the relative contributions of phenotypic plasticity versus evolutionary responses - is difficult. To our knowledge, no study has yet reported evidence that evolutionary change underlies the most widely reported phenotypic response to climate change: the advancement of breeding times. In a wild population of red deer, average parturition date has advanced by nearly 2 weeks in 4 decades. Here, we quantify the contribution of plastic, demographic, and genetic components to this change. In particular, we quantify the role of direct phenotypic plasticity in response to increasing temperatures and the role of changes in the population structure. Importantly, we show that adaptive evolution likely played a role in the shift towards earlier parturition dates. The observed rate of evolution was consistent with a response to selection and was less likely to be due to genetic drift. Our study provides a rare example of observed rates of genetic change being consistent with theoretical predictions, although the consistency would not have been detected with a solely phenotypic analysis. It also provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence of both evolution and phenotypic plasticity contributing to advances in phenology in a changing climate. © 2019 Bonnet et al.

	abstract = {Plant trait diversity is known to influence population yield, but the scale at which this happens remains unknown: divergent individuals might change yields of immediate neighbors (neighbor scale) or of plants across a population (population scale). We use Nicotiana attenuata plants silenced in mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (irMPK4) - with low water-use efficiency (WUE) - to study the scale at which water-use traits alter intraspecific population yields. In the field and glasshouse, we observed overyielding in populations with low percentages of irMPK4 plants, unrelated to water-use phenotypes. Paired-plant experiments excluded the occurrence of overyielding effects at the neighbor scale. Experimentally altering field arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal associations by silencing the Sym-pathway gene NaCCaMK did not affect reproductive overyielding, implicating an effect independent of belowground AMF interactions. Additionally, micro-grafting experiments revealed dependence on shoot-expressed MPK4 for N. attenuata to vary its yield per neighbor presence. We find that variation in a single-gene, MPK4, is responsible for population overyielding through a mechanism, independent of irMPK4‘s WUE phenotype, at the aboveground, population scale. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Plant species diversity affects carbon and nutrient cycling during litter decomposition, yet the generality of the direction of this effect and its magnitude remain uncertain. With a meta-analysis including 65 field studies across the Earth’s major forest ecosystems, we show here that decomposition was faster when litter was composed of more than one species. These positive biodiversity effects were mostly driven by temperate forests, but were more variable in other forests. Litter mixture effects emerged most strongly in early decomposition stages and were related to divergence in litter quality. Litter diversity also accelerated nitrogen, but not phosphorus release, potentially indicating a decoupling of nitrogen and phosphorus cycling and perhaps a shift in ecosystem nutrient limitation with changing biodiversity. Our findings demonstrate the importance of litter diversity effects for carbon and nutrient dynamics during decomposition, and show how these effects vary with litter traits, decomposer complexity and forest characteristics. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {In 1979, Richard Law introduced the conceptual idea of the ‘Darwinian Demon’: an organism that simultaneously maximizes all fitness traits [1]. Such an organism would dominate an ecosystem, displacing any competitors and collapsing biodiversity to only a singular species. Surveying the tremendous species diversity of bacteria in the microbial world reveals that Darwinian Demons do not exist on Earth, and the popular notion is that fitness trade-offs generally constrain such possible evolution. However, the trade-offs faced by evolving bacterial populations presumably hinder their adaptation in ways that are not fully understood. In some cases, bacteria show evolved trade-ups, whereby selection causes multiple fitness components to improve simultaneously. Understanding these trade-offs and trade-ups, as well as their prevalence and roles in shaping microbial fitness, is key to elucidating how the incredible diversity of the Bacteria domain came to be, what maintains that diversity, and whether such diversity can be leveraged for technologies that improve human health and protect environments. Bacteria are under constant selective pressure and adaptation to one pressure can have pleiotrophic effects on other traits. In this essay, Burmeister and Turner discuss how lytic phages can select for evolution of phage resistance, thereby creating trade-offs that influence evolution of greater or lesser bacterial resistance to antibiotics. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Intensively managed monoculture plantations are increasingly replacing natural forests across the tropics resulting in changes in ecological niches of species and communities, and in ecosystem functioning. Collembola are among the most abundant arthropods inhabiting the belowground system sensitively responding to changes in vegetation and soil conditions. However, most studies on the response of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis (13C and 15N) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Δ13C values were highest in rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this system. Lower Δ13C values, but high Δ13C variation in Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small range inΔ15N values in Collembola species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber hadΔ15Nvalues below those of leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Δ15N values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger. Overall, the results suggest that rainforest conversion into plantation systems is associated with marked shifts in the structure of trophic niches in soil and litter Collembola with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning and food-web stability.  © 2021 Susanti et al.},

	abstract = {In recent years, three large populations of Cyperus flavescens were found in Poland, the richest occurrence of this species in over 30 years. The goal of this research is to determine the habitat factors lead to the mass occurrence of C. flavescens and the present situation of that species and its habitat in Central Europe. Soil conditions of the three populations were studied. To determine the correlation between the occurrence and abundance of species and the chemical parameters of the soil, the DCA and CCA methods were used. TheDCAof environmental Ellenberg values was made for all relevés known from Poland. The occurrence of C. flavescens in plant communities in Central Europe was studied. The maximum entropy method was used for potential distribution analysis of C. flavescens. All analyzed traits are important for this species and none has an advantage over another, so the environmental factor affecting the occurrence of C. flavescens is different from the tested. Analysis on Ellenberg values indicate that the longest gradients are temperature, moisture and nutrients. The analysis of vegetation data involving Cyperus flavescens available from Central Europe indicates that this species occurs mainly in the company of Juncus bufonius and Plantago intermedia, whereas other species of the Isoëto-Nanojuncetea class appear rarely. In MaxEnt analysis based on bioclimatic variables, the most important variable is BIO1 (Annual Mean Temperature). The results of our observation indicate that anthropogenic factors such as grazing livestock have a positive effect on the occurrence of the species. It is also very likely that the species is promoted by very warm summers with only short periods of heavy rains. A map of the potential distribution of C. flavescens in Central Europe created according historical and future data show an extension of the range of potential habitats to the north and east.

	abstract = {Background: Mimusops coriacea (A.DC.) Miq., (Sapotaceae), originated from Africa, were introduced to coastal areas in Ecuador where it is not extensively used as a traditional medicine to treat various human diseases. Different therapeutically uses of the species include: analgesic, antimicrobial, hypoglycemic, inflammation and pain relieve associated with bone and articulation-related diseases. Furthermore, Mimusops coriacea could be used as anti-oxidant agent. However, botanical, chemical or molecular barcode information related to this much used species is not available from Ecuador. In this study, morphological characterization was performed from leaves, stem and seeds. Furthermore, genetic characterization was performed using molecular barcodes for rbcL, matk, ITS1 and ITS2 using DNA extracted from leaves. Methods: Macro-morphological description was performed on fresh leaves, stem and seeds. For anatomical evaluation, tissues were embedded in paraffin and transversal dissections were done following incubation with sodium hypochlorite and safranin for coloration and fixated later in glycerinated gelatin. DNA extraction was performed using a modified CTAB protocol from leaf tissues, while amplification by PCR was accomplished for the molecular barcodes rbcL, matK, ITS1 and ITS2. Sequence analysis was performed using blast in the GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with accessions queried in the GenBank belonging to the subfamily Sapotoideae. Results: Leaf size was 13.56 ± 1.46 × 7.49 ± 0.65 cm; where is a macro-morphological description of the stem (see Methods). The peel of the seeds is dark brown. Sequence analysis revealed that amplicons were generated using the four barcodes selected. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the barcodes rbcL and matK, were not discriminated between species within the same genus of the subfamily Sapotoideae. On the other hand, the ITS1 and ITS2 were discriminative at the level of genus and species of the Sapotoideae. Copyright 2019 Bustamante et al.},

Understanding how these modifications arise will inform us of how mosquitoes are responding to climate change and vector control interventions. CHCs are synthesised in sub-epidermal cells called oenocytes that are very difficult to isolate from surrounding tissues. Here we utilise a transgenic line with fluorescent oenocytes to purify these cells for the first time.

	abstract = {Ursidae is a monophyletic group comprised of three subfamilies: Tremarctinae, Ursinae and Ailuropodinae, all of which have a rich geographical distribution. The phylogenetic relationships within the Ursidae group have been underexamined, especially regarding morphological traits such as the basicranium. Importantly, the basicranium is a highly complex region that covers a small portion of the skull, combining both structural and functional aspects that determine its morphology. Phylogenetic hypotheses of the Ursidae (including Tremarctinae) have been made based on morphological characters that considers skull, mandible and teeth features, while specific characters of the auditory region and basicranium have not been taken into account. To do this, we analyse the shape and size macroevolution of the basicranium of Ursidae, testing its morphological disparity in a phylogenetic context, which is quantified by means of the phylogenetic signal. We investigated phylogenetical autocorrelation by shape (depicted by Principal Components Analysis scores from previous published analyses) and basicranium size (depicted by centroid size, CS) using an orthonormal decomposition analysis and Abouheif C mean. The main advantages of these methods are that they rely exclusively on cladogram topology and do not require branch-length estimates. Also, an optimisation of the ancestral nodes was performed using TNT 1.5 software. In relation to the phylogenetic signal, both methods showed similar results: the presence of autocorrelation was detected in PC1 and PC2, while in PC3, PC4 and PC5 and in the size of the basicranium (CS), the absence of autocorrelation occurred. The most significant nodes (where there is autocorrelation) are the basal nodes 'Ursidae' and 'Ursinae-Tremarctinae'. Within this last group, distinctive basicranium morphology is observed, being more conservative in Tremarctinae than in Ursinae. The differences between these subfamilies could be related to historical events involving varying food and environmental preferences. The high phylogenetic signal in the node Tremarctinae probably indicates that the basicranium configuration of these bears was obtained early in their evolutionary history. Finally, our results of the basicranium and skull length ratios indicate that in Tremarctinae, the basicranium size was not determined by phylogeny but instead by other factors, such as adaptive responses to climatic changes and competition with other carnivores. © 2019 Arnaudo et al.},

	abstract = {In Mediterranean-Climate Ecosystems (MCEs), Holocene coastal dunes comprise small, fragmented and dynamic features which have nutritionally imbalanced and excessively drained, droughty, sandy soils. These characteristics, along with summer drought and salt-laden winds, pose many challenges for plant colonization and persistence. Consequently, MCE dune floras are likely to be distinctive with a high proportion of habitat specialists and strong convergence in growth form mixes. Very little research has compared the species traits of dune floras within and across MCEs. This paper contributes to filling that gap. Here, we analyze the taxonomic, biological and geographical traits for all 402 species in a flora from a dune landscape (Cape St Francis) in the southeastern Cape Floristic Region (CFR) and compare patterns with the trait profiles of other dune floras at a regional (CFR) and global (MCE) scale. Within the CFR, the southeastern (all-year-rainfall) flora at Cape St Francis had a similar trait profile to western (winter-rainfall) dune floras, except for having a lower representation of species belonging to CFR-endemic clades, and higher number of species associated with tropical lineages. The St Francis flora, in common with other CFR and MCE floras, was dominated by members of the Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Some 40% of the St Francis flora was endemic to the CFR, typical of the high rate of MCE-level endemism elsewhere in the CFR, and in other MCEs. About 30% of the flora was confined to calcareous sand, a value typical for many other MCE sites. The St Francis flora, as well as other CFR dune floras, differs from those of other MCEs by having many species associated with shrubby lineages, and by the relatively high incidence of species associated with tropical lineages. The growth form profile of the St Francis and other CFR floras shows strongest similarity with that of Australian MCE dunes in that in both regions, evergreen hemicryptophytes and shrubs share dominance, and annuals are floristically and ecologically subordinate. The least similar of MCEs to the St Francis trait profile is the Mediterranean Basin where annuals are the most frequent growth form while shrubs are subordinate. California and Chile dune floras appear to occupy an intermediate position, in terms of growth form mix, between the Cape and Australia on the one hand, where dune floras have retained features typical of nutrient-poor soils, and the Mediterranean Basin, where dwarf, deciduous shrubs and annuals dominate the life form spectrum. All MCE dunes are threatened by alien plants, infrastructure development, tourism demands and rising sea levels. The high incidence of species of conservation concern in CFR dune floras underestimates the exponentially increasing threats to their habitats, which are already historically at a much-reduced extent. All remaining coastal dune habitat in the CFR, and probably in other MCEs, should be conserved in their entirety. Copyright © 2019 Cowling et al.},

	abstract = {How species will adapt to future climate change is a key question in modern biology. One way to predict such adaptation is to draw from our knowledge of current spatial patterns of phenotypic variation. These are often summarised by different ecogeographical rules that describe how environmental gradients predict geographic variation in form and function. A recent review in Current Biology [1] synthesises how ecogeographical rules can lead to predictions about future responses to climate change in terms of appendage size, physiology, life-history traits, distribution and colour. Based on Gloger's rule, which predicts darker coloured animals in warm and wet environments, Tian and Benton [1] suggest that animals will become darker with global warming. Although the authors mention that uncertainties in the way this ecogeographical rule is interpreted make predictions difficult [1], here we argue that the opposite scenario is more likely — that selection will favour animals with lighter colours. Delhey et al. argue that the two main ecogeographical patterns of colour variation, Gloger's rule and the thermal melanism hypothesis, should be used to predict the effects of climate change on animal colour. They forecast colour lightening in regions becoming warmer and drier, but less clear patterns if both temperature and rainfall increase. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {The reproducibility and translation of neuroscience research is assumed to be undermined by introducing environmental complexity and heterogeneity. Rearing laboratory animals with minimal (if any) environmental stimulation is thought to control for biological variability but may not adequately test the robustness of our animal models. Standard laboratory housing is associated with reduced demonstrations of species typical behaviors and changes in neurophysiology that may impact the translation of research results. Modest increases in environmental enrichment (EE) mitigate against insults used to induce animal models of disease, directly calling into question the translatability of our work. This may in part underlie the disconnect between preclinical and clinical research findings. Enhancing environmental stimulation for our model organisms promotes ethological natural behaviors but may simultaneously increase phenotypic trait variability. To test this assumption, we conducted a systematic review and evaluated coefficients of variation (CVs) between EE and standard housed mice and rats. Given findings of suboptimal reporting of animal laboratory housing conditions, we also developed a methodological reporting table for enrichment use in neuroscience research. Our data show that animals housed in EE were not more variable than those in standard housing. Therefore, environmental heterogeneity introduced into the laboratory, in the form of enrichment, does not compromise data integrity. Overall, human life is complicated, and by embracing such nuanced complexity into our laboratories, we may paradoxically improve on the rigor and reproducibility of our research. © 2021 Kentner et al.},

	abstract = {Shifts in the timing of bird migration have been associated with climatic change and species traits. However, climatic change does not affect all species or geographic locations equally. Climate in the Pacific Northwest has shifted during the last century with mean temperatures increasing by 1oC but little change in total annual precipitation. Few long-term data on migration phenology of birds are available in the Pacific Northwest. We analyzed trends in spring arrival dates from a site in the Oregon Coast Range where nearly daily inventories of birds were conducted in 24 of 29 years. Several species showed statistically significant shifts in timing of first spring arrivals. Six of 18 species occur significantly earlier now than during the initial phase of the study. One species arrives significantly later. Eleven show no significant shifts in timing. We associated trends in spring migration phenology with regional climatic variables, weather (precipitation and temperature), traits of species such as migration strategy, foraging behavior, diet, and habitat use, and regional trends in abundance as indexed by Breeding Bird Survey data. We found no set of variables consistently correlated with avian phenological changes. Post hoc analyses of additional climate variables revealed an association of migratory arrival dates across the 18 species with rainfall totals in northern California, presumably indicating that songbird arrival dates in Oregon are slowed by spring storm systems in California. When only the six species with the most strongly advancing arrival dates were analyzed, winter maximum temperatures in the preceding three winters appeared consistently in top models, suggesting a possible role for food availability early in spring to promote the survival and successful reproduction of the earliest-arriving birds. However, additional data on food availability and avian survival and reproductive success are required to test that hypothesis. Despite the appearance of some climate variables in top models, there remains a mismatch between strongly advancing arrival dates in some songbirds and a lack of clear directional change in those climate variables. We conclude that either some previously unrecognized variable or combination of variables has affected the timing of migration in some species but not others, or the appearance of statistically significant directional changes over time can occur without being driven by consistent environmental or species-specific factors. © 2019 Robinson et al.},

	abstract = {                             Background. Paddies are an important anthropogenic source of methane emissions to the atmosphere, and they are impacted by heavy metal pollution. Nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) pollution might either enhance or mitigate CH                             4                              emission from paddy soils due to the total amounts of metals, bioavailability and functional microbial activity and composition. Methods. An incubation experiment was conducted, and different Ni and Co concentrations were added to test the effects of trace metals on methane production in paddy soil. The archaea community structure and the abundance of methanogen functional groups in the paddy soil with added Ni and Co were detected using high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR based on the 16S rRNA and mcrA (methyl coenzyme M reductase) genes, respectively. Results. The highest methane production rate was 561 mg CH                             4                              kg                             −1                              dry soil d                             −1                              with the addition of 50 mg kg                             −1                              Ni and 684 mg CH                             4                              kg                             −1                              dry soil d                             −1                              with the addition of 25 mg kg                             −1                              Co. Accordingly, the mcrA gene was most abundant in the 50 mg kg                             −1                              Ni addition (3.1 × 10                             6                              ± 0.5 × 10                             6                              copies g                             −1                              dry soil). The lowest mcrA gene abundance was detected in the 500 mg kg                             −1                              Co addition (9.2× 10                             5                              ± 0.4 × 10                             5                              copies g                             −1                              dry soil). The dominant methanogens were Methanobacterium, Methanosarcina, Methanocella, Methanomassiliicoccus, Bathyarchaeota, and Rice Cluster I (RC-I), and the relative abundances of these groups were higher than 1% in the Ni and Co treatments. Additionally, the archaeal compositions differed significantly in the soils with various Ni and Co additions. The most abundant Methanococcus spp. represented 51.3% of the composition in the 50 mg kg                             −1                              Ni addition, which was significantly higher than that of the control (12.9% to 17.5%). Discussion. Our results indicated that the contamination of soil by Ni and Co significantly affected total methanogens abundance and specific methanogen functional groups. Ni and Co additions to paddy soil promoted methanogenic activity at low concentrations, while they had inhibitory effects at high concentrations. Because paddy soils largely contribute to methane emissions and are increasingly exposed to heavy metal pollution, our results show that future assessments of greenhouse gas flux from paddy soils should take into account the effects of pollution by Ni and Co.

	abstract = {Biological traits are increasingly used in order to study aspects of ecology as they are related to the organisms' fitness. Here we analyze a dataset of 23 traits regarding the life cycle, distribution, ecology and behavior of 235 nektonic species of the Mediterranean Sea in order to evaluate the distribution of traits, identify rare ones, detect relationships between trait pairs and identify species functional groups. Trait relationships were tested using correlation and non-linear regression for continuous traits, parametric and nonparametric inference tests for pairs of continuous-categorical traits and cooccurrence testing for categorical traits. The findings have significant implications concerning the potential effects of climate change (e.g., through the relationships of the trait of optimal temperature), fisheries or habitat loss (from the relationships of traits related to tolerance ranges). Furthermore, some unexpected relationships are documented, like the inversely proportional relationship between longevity and age at maturity as a percentage of life span. Associations between functional traits show affinities derived from phylogenetic constraints or life strategies; however, relationships among functional and ecological traits can indicate the potential environmental filtering that acts on functional traits. In total, 18 functional groups were identified by Hill-Smith ordination and hierarchical clustering and were characterized by their dominant traits. For the assessment of the results, we first evaluate the importance of each trait at the level of population, community, ecosystem and landscape and then propose the traits that should be monitored for the regulation and resilience of ecosystem functioning and the management of the marine ecosystems. © 2020 Tzanatos et al.},

	abstract = {Evolution in nature occurs in the provemmrbial tangled bank. The species interactions characterizing this tangled bank can be strongly affected by global change and can also influence the fitness and selective effects of a global change on a focal population. As a result, species interactions can influence which traits will promote adaptation and the magnitude or direction of evolutionary responses to the global change. First, we provide a framework describing how species interactions may influence evolutionary responses to global change. Then, we highlight case studies that have explicitly manipulated both a global change and the presence or abundance of interacting species and used either experimental evolution or quantitative genetics approaches to test for the effects of species interactions on evolutionary responses to global change. Although still not frequently considered, we argue that species interactions commonly modulate the effects of global change on the evolution of plant and animal populations. As a result, predicting the evolutionary effects of the multitude of global changes facing natural populations requires both community ecology and evolutionary perspectives. © 2019 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Increasing cross-border trade of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) has put heavy pressure on a considerable number of species in the Himalayas. One of the threatened species in Nepal is Aconitum spicatum. Unfortunately for this species and for many others, our knowledge on population ecology and performance across the distribution range is insufficient, hindering the formulation of species-specific management plans. We therefore studied density and population structure of A. spicatum and assessed variation in its life history traits among three populations (subalpine, lower alpine and alpine) along an elevation gradient (3,000-4,200 m a.s.l.) in Annapurna Conservation Area, north-central Nepal. The results show that human disturbances and topographic factors contributed to the variation in density and life history traits. The overall density ranged between 0.56 ± 0.09 (Mean ± SE) and 2.48 ± 0.24 plants/m2 with highest mean density in the lower alpine and lowest in the subalpine population. The subalpine population was also characterized by lower investment in reproductive structures with lowest seed mass and low seed viability and fecundity. Among the environmental variables tested, harvesting, animal droppings and fire appeared to be the most important factors affecting density of different life stages of A. spicatum. The prevailing harvesting pattern is destructive as it involves uprooting of the whole plant and this appears to be a main reason for low recruitment and reduced density of the subalpine population. The level of disturbance decreased with increasing elevation. In terms of reproductive effort, the alpine population performed best. Our results indicate that the viability of A. spicatum populations depends on controlling over-harvesting and pre-mature harvesting of tubers and protecting younger life stages from grazing, trampling and fire. We therefore recommend that when formulating management guidelines, measures aiming to mitigate such anthropogenic disturbances should be considered. Copyright © 2019 Chapagain et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is ubiquitous, has intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and is associated with serious hospital-associated infections. It has evolved from being a burn wound infection into a major nosocomial threat. In this study, we compared and correlated the antimicrobial resistance, virulence traits and clonal relatedness between clinical and fresh water environmental isolates of P. aeruginosa. Methods. 219 P. aeruginosa isolates were studied: (a) 105 clinical isolates from 1977 to 1985 (n = 52) and 2015 (n = 53), and (b) 114 environmental isolates from different fresh water sources. All isolates were subjected to ERIC-PCR typing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and virulence factor genes screening. Results. Clinical and environmental isolates of P. aeruginosa were genetically heteroge-nous, with only four clinical isolates showing 100% identical ERIC-PCR patterns to seven environmental isolates. Most of the clinical and environmental isolates were sensitive to almost all of the antipseudomonal drugs, except for ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. Increased resistant isolates was seen in 2015 compared to that of the archived isolates; four MDR strains were detected and all were retrieved in 2015. All clinical isolates retrieved from 1977 to 1985 were susceptible to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin; but in comparison, the clinical isolates recovered in 2015 exhibited 9.4% resistance to ceftazidime and 5.7% to ciprofloxacin; a rise in resistance to imipenem (3.8% to 7.5%), piperacillin (9.6% to 11.3%) and amikacin (1.9% to 5.7%) and a slight drop in resistance rates to piperacillin/tazobactam (7.7% to 7.5%), ticarcillin/clavulanic acid (19.2% to 18.9%), meropenem (15.4% to 7.5%), doripenem (11.5% to 7.5%), gentamicin (7.7% to 7.5%) and netilmicin (7.7% to 7.5%). Environmental isolates were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam (1.8%), ciprofloxacin (1.8%), piperacillin (4.4%) and carbapenems (doripenem 11.4%, meropenem 8.8% and imipenem 2.6%). Both clinical and environmental isolates showed high prevalence of virulence factor genes, but none were detected in 10 (9.5%) clinical and 18 (15.8%) environmental isolates. The exoT gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates. Resistance to carbapenems (meropenem, doripenem and imipenem), β-lactamase inhibitors (ticarcillin/clavulanic acid and piperacillin/tazobactam), piperacillin, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin was observed in some of the isolates without virulence factor genes. Five virulence-negative isolates were susceptible to all of the antimicrobials. Only one MDR strain harbored none of the virulence factor genes. Conclusion. Over a period of 30 years, a rise in antipseudomonal drug resistance particularly to ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin was observed in two hospitals in Malaysia. © Copyright 2019 Liew et al.},

To study the mechanisms maintaining diversity in subalpine coniferous forests, species presence frequency and diversity in the four distinct patch types (G, B, M and D) of Larix chinensis conifer forests at three altitudinal gradients in the Qinling Mountains were analyzed. Our results were as follows: (1) Different species (or functional groups) had distinct presence frequencies in the four different patch types along the altitudinal gradient. (2) Some species or functional groups (species groups sharing similar traits and response to environment) only occurred in some specific patches. For seed dispersal, species using wind mainly occurred in G and D, while species using small animals mainly occurred in B and M. (3) Species composition of adjacent patch types was more similar than non-adjacent patch types, based on the lower β diversity index of the former. (4) The maximum numbers of species and two diversity indices (D′ and H′) were found in the middle altitudes. Various gap-forming processes and dispersal limitation may be the two major mechanisms determining species diversity in Larix chinensis coniferous forests at the patch scale. © 2016 PeerJ Inc..

	abstract = {Melatonin is an important biologically active hormone that plays a vital role in plant growth and development. In particular, it has been investigated for its roles in abiotic stress management. The current experiment was carried out to investigate the protective role of melatonin in photosynthetic traits and the antioxidant defense system of maize seedling under drought stress. Maize seedlings were subjected to drought stress (40–45% FC) after two weeks of seedling emergence, followed by a foliar spray (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 µM) and soil drench of melatonin (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 µM). Our results indicated that drought stress negatively affected maize seedling and decreased plant growth and development, biomass accumulation, reduced chlorophyll, and carotenoid content, and significantly declined photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance. On the other hand, reactive oxygen species, soluble protein, and proline content increased under drought stress. However, the application of exogenous melatonin reduced the reactive oxygen species burst and enhanced the photosynthetic activity by protecting from damages through activation of various antioxidant enzymes under drought stress. Foliar application of 100 µM and soil drench of 50 µM melatonin was the most effective treatment concentrations under drought stress. Our current findings hereby confirmed the mitigating potential of melatonin application for drought stress by maintaining plant growth, improving the photosynthetic characteristics and activities of antioxidants enzymes.

	abstract = {Multi-use marine protected areas (MUMPAs) are a commonly applied tool for marine conservation in developing countries, particularly where large no-take reserves are not socially or politically feasible. Although MUMPAs have produced benefits around the world, the persistence of moderate fishing pressure reduces the likelihood of achieving the primary objective of these areas, which is the conservation of ecosystems. In this study we used traditional and functional metrics to evaluate how fish assemblages changed through time in a MUMPA, including shifts in species responses and in ecological processes. We conducted visual censuses of fishes at Espíritu Santo Island, México (MUMPA; N D320; 24°N, 110°W) from 2005 to 2017 to assess fish richness, size-distribution and density. Three functional indices were calculated using six traits (size, mobility, period of activity, aggregation, position in water column and diet): Functional richness (volume occupied by species), dispersion (complementarity between species) and originality (inverse of functional redundancy). We compared fish diversity among three management zone types (sustainable fishing, traditional fishing and no-take zones), through a 13-year period, assessing which species increased or decreased in occurrence, density, and biomass, and how indices respond over time. Despite a general increase in biomass and stability in density and originality, we detected a reduction in fish biodiversity in the form of declines in species and functional richness, which could imply the risk of local extinction and decrease in certain ecosystem processes. In addition, changes in functional dispersion showed that some functions are losing representation through time. Although no single cause is apparent, such factors as competitive interactions, habitat loss and persistence of fishing pressure potentially explain these decreases. The rise in biomass was associated with a general increase in the average size, rather than increased biomass of commercial species, as the latter remained stable during the study period. Expansion of no-take areas, enforcement of fishing regulations, and surveillance in core zones, should be implemented to reverse the decline in particular species and to promote conservation of fish functional diversity in this MUMPA. © 2020 Ramírez-Ortiz et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Pandi's mushroom-tongue salamander (Bolitoglossa pandi) is one of the threatened amphibians in South America, as well as a flagship species for the Colombian conservation agenda. This species is endemic to the Andean cloud forests of the western slope of the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia, occurring only in the department of Cundinamarca within a narrow elevational range. At night, B. pandi can be seen perching on the upper side of leaves at heights ranging from ground level to 2.5 m. During the day, it can be found under leaf litter or cover objects. Few studies have provided relevant information that can help the Colombian government to formulate lines of action for the conservation of this species; consequently, its threat assessments so far have been based on very limited information. Methods. We conducted surveys for salamanders in four municipalities of Cundinamarca, Colombia, using two approaches: visual encounter surveys (Guaduas and Villeta) and the basic sampling protocol for single-species occupancy modeling (Supatá and Venecia). Multivariate analyses were employed to explore the correlation between habitat structure and natural history traits, abundance, and detection/non-detection of B. pandi. We evaluated the B. pandi activity pattern through kernel density curves for each sampling occasion and explored the variability of salamander abundance during their activity period by performing a nested ANOVA. Results. We report the discovery of two new populations of B. pandi, which represent the most northwestern records known. A significant correlation between body length, body mass, and habitat structure was observed. Multivariate analyses indicated that leaf litter depth, mean temperature, percent vegetation cover, and altitude were the habitat variables that together explained 60.3% of the B. pandi abundance variability, as well as the main determinants of its optimal habitat. Bolitoglossa pandi exhibits an activity pattern characterized by two main activity peaks, in which niche time-partitioning was observed. Across the surveyed area, we found a healthy, stable, highly dense population of B. pandi (>1,300 individuals), with seasonal variability between development stages. Discussion. Given the high habitat specificity of B. pandi, the species is highly vulnerable to local changes. Thus, we recommend that B. pandi be retained as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List, based on the IUCN Criterion B, given its restricted extent of occurrence (ca. 2,500 km2) and the ongoing threats from agriculture, cattle ranching, logging, and urban development, which continue to reduce its suitable habitat.

	abstract = {Geochemical analyses applied to lake sedimentary records can reveal the history of pollution by metals and the effects of remedial efforts. Lakes provide ideal environments for geochemical studies because they have steady deposition of fine grained material suitable for fixation of pollutants. The Laurentian Great Lakes are the most studied system in this field, and they have well-preserved chronological profiles. To date, this important system has been considered in parts for inorganic geochemistry, hampering basin-wide conclusions regarding metal contamination. We filled spatial and temporal gaps in a comprehensive geochemical analysis of 11 sediment cores collected from all five Great Lakes. Hierarchical cluster analysis of all Great Lakes samples divided the metal analytes into five functional groups: (1) carbonate elements; (2) metals and oxides with diverse natural sources, including a subgroup of analytes known to be anthropogenically enriched (Cd, Pb, Sn, Zn, and Sb); (3) common crustal elements; (4) metals related to coal and nuclear power generation; and (5) all of the co-occurring rare earth elements. Two contamination indices (Igeo and EF) applied to sedimentary metals indicated that Na, Co, Mn, Cd, Pb, Ta, and Cu were each, at some point during the Anthropocene, the most enriched metal pollutants in Great Lakes sediments. Land uses correlated with the metal analytes, such as increases in contaminant metals with the rise in catchment population and increases in carbonate elements (e.g. Ca) with agriculture. Certain contamination trends were observed basin-wide, such as for the atmospheric pollutant Pb, which followed a rise associated with fossil fuel combustion and a decline following the ban of leaded gasoline. Other trends were lake-specific, such as recent high concentrations of Na in Lake Superior, likely due to road salt applications, and a late-20th-century peak in Ca associated with algal whiting events in Lake Ontario. Some metals exceeded guidelines for sediment quality, in some cases prior to European settlement of the basin, indicating that a paleolimnological context is important for appropriate management of sediment contamination. The Great Lakes are sensitive to environmental changes such as pollution by metals, and it is clear that while there has been remedial success, results from the uppermost intervals of cores indicate ongoing problems. © 2020 Aliff et al.},

	abstract = {Impatiens capensis is an annual plant native to eastern North America that is currently spreading across Europe. In Poland, due to this plant’s rapid spread in the secondary range and high competitiveness in relation to native species, it is considered a locally invasive species. The microstructure of seeds is an important tool for solving various taxonomic problems and also provides data useful for determining the impact of various environmental factors on the phenotypic variability of species. This issue is particularly important in regard to invasive species which occupy a wide range of habitats in the invaded range. There are few reports on seed size and thus far no descriptions of the seed ultrastructure of I. capensis in the analyzed literature. We present new data on the seed morphology of I. capensis growing in different habitats and conditions in the secondary range of the species. The studied populations differed significantly in each of the investigated traits (seed length, width, circumference, area, roundness, and mass). Our findings showed that anthropogenic disturbances in habitats and some soil parameters (presence of carbonates, potassium, loose sand, and moisture) were statistically significant with various seed sizes and morphology in the studied populations of I. capensis. Moreover, our studies showed maximum seed length (5.74 mm) and width (3.21 mm) exceeding those values given in the available literature. For the first time, we also provide a detailed SEM study of the ultrastructure of the seed coat of I. capensis. There are two types of epidermal cells on the seeds: (a) between the ribs (elongated with straight anticlinal walls, slightly concave outer periclinal walls, and micropapillate secondary sculpture on the edges with anticyclic walls), and (b) on the ribs (isodiametric cells with straight anticlinal walls and concave outer periclinal walls). Unlike the variability of size and weight of seeds, the coat ornamentation has turned out to be a steady feature within the studied secondary range of I. capensis. Copyright 2020 Rewicz et al.

	abstract = {Multi-type infection processes are ubiquitous in ecology, epidemiology and social systems, but remain hard to analyze and to understand on a fundamental level. Here, we study a multi-strain susceptible-infected-susceptible model with coinfection. A host already colonized by one strain can become more or less vulnerable to co-colonization by a second strain, as a result of facilitating or competitive interactions between the two. Fitness differences between N strains are mediated through N2 altered susceptibilities to secondary infection that depend on colonizer-cocolonizer identities (Kij). By assuming strain similarity in such pairwise traits, we derive a model reduction for the endemic system using separation of timescales. This ‘quasi-neutrality’ in trait space sets a fast timescale where all strains interact neutrally, and a slow timescale where selective dynamics unfold. We find that these slow dynamics are governed by the replicator equation for N strains. Our framework allows to build the community dynamics bottom-up from only pairwise invasion fitnesses between members. We highlight that mean fitness of the multi-strain network, changes with their individual dynamics, acts equally upon each type, and is a key indicator of system resistance to invasion. By uncovering the link between N-strain epidemiological coexistence and the replicator equation, we show that the ecology of co-colonization relates to Fisher’s fundamental theorem and to Lotka-Volterra systems. Besides efficient computation and complexity reduction for any system size, these results open new perspectives into high-dimensional community ecology, detection of species interactions, and evolution of biodiversity. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) has been used to understand photosynthesis and its response to climate change, particularly with satellite-based data. However, it remains unclear how the ChlF ratio and photosynthesis are linked at the leaf level under drought stress. Here, we examined the link between ChlF ratio and photosynthesis at the leaf level by measuring photosynthetic traits, such as net CO2 assimilation rate (An), the maximum carboxylation rate of Rubisco (Vcmax), the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax), stomatal conductance (gs) and total chlorophyll content (Chlt). The ChlF ratio of the leaf level such as maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) is based on fluorescence kinetics. ChlF intensity ratio (LD685/LD740) based on spectrum analysis was obtained. We found that a combination of the stomatal limitation, non-stomatal limitation, and Chlt regulated leaf photosynthesis under drought stress, while Jmax and Chlt governed the ChlF ratio. A significant link between the ChlF ratio and An was found under drought stress while no significant correlation in the control, which indicated that drought stress strengthens the link between the ChlF ratio and photosynthetic traits. These results suggest that the ChlF ratio can be a powerful tool to track photosynthetic traits of terrestrial ecosystems under drought stress. Copyright © 2020 Zhuang et al.},

	abstract = {Variation in leaf morphology is correlated with environmental variables, such as precipitation, temperature and soil composition. Several studies have pointed out that individual plasticity can largely explain the foliar phenotypic differences observed in populations due to climatic change and have suggested that the environment plays an important role in the evolution of plant species by selecting for phenotypic variation. Thus, the study of foliar morphology in plant populations can help us identify the environmental factors that have potentially influenced the process of species diversification. In this study, we analyzed morphological variation in the leaf traits of the Ternstroemia lineata species complex (Penthaphylacaceae) and its relation to climatic variables across the species distribution area to identify the patterns of morphological differentiation within this species complex. Based on the collected leaves of 270 individuals from 32 populations, we analyzed nine foliar traits using spatial interpolation models and multivariate statistics. A principal component analysis identified three main morphological traits (leaf length and two leaf shape variables) that were used to generate interpolated surface maps to detect discrete areas delimited by zones of rapid change in the values of the morphological traits. We identified a mosaic coarse-grain pattern of geographical distribution in the variation of foliar traits. According to the interpolation maps, we could define nine morphological groups and their geographic distributions. Longer leaves, spatulate leaves and the largest foliar area were located in sites with lower precipitation and higher seasonality of precipitation following a northwest-southeast direction and following significant latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. According to the phenogram of the relationships of the nine morphological groups based on morphological similarity, the putative species and subspecies of the T. lineata species complex did not show a clear pattern of differentiation. In this study, we found a complex pattern of differentiation with some isolated populations and some other contiguous populations differentiated by different traits. Further genetic and systematic studies are needed to clarify the evolutionary relationships in this species complex. © 2020 Alcántara-Ayala et al.},

	abstract = {Linear clearings for human activities cause internal fragmentation of otherwise intact native forest, with many potential impacts on wildlife. Across a boreal forest region of some 4,000 km2, we investigated how movements and habitat use of ecologically different mammal species are affected by narrow (about eight m) seismic line (SL) clearings associated with fossil fuel extraction, which form extensive networks many kilometers long. We conducted nine repeat snow track surveys during three winters at 14 pairs of one-kilometer transects, each comprising one transect along the SL and a second running perpendicular into adjacent forest. Data for 13 individually-analyzed mammal taxa (species or sets of closely related species) and five mammal groups, categorized based on body size-diet combinations, showed that movements across transects were either unaffected by SL clearings (relative to continuous forest) or restricted only slightly. However, these clearings were favored for linear travel by most species and body size-diet groups (excepting small mammals). The strength of this preference varied in a manner consistent with species' differing needs to move long distances (associated with their energetic requirements): large predators > large herbivores > mid-sized predators > mid-sized herbivores > small mammals. In terms of overall habitat use, large-bodied predators (e.g., wolves and coyotes) strongly selected SL clearings over forest, medium-sized predators (e.g., mustelids) and medium-sized herbivores (e.g., hares and squirrels) preferred forest, and neither large herbivores nor small mammals had a clear habitat preference. Consequently, there was a net shift in both species and trophic composition within the SL, in favor of large predators and away from medium-sized predators and herbivores. Given the high regional SL density (1.9 km/km2) such shifts are likely to have complex ecological consequences, of currently unknown magnitude. © 2019 PeerJ Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The temperature-dependence of many important mosquito-borne diseases has never been quantified. These relationships are critical for understanding current distributions and predicting future shifts from climate change. We used trait-based models to characterize temperature-dependent transmission of 10 vector–pathogen pairs of mosquitoes (Culex pipiens, Cx. quinquefascsiatus, Cx. tarsalis, and others) and viruses (West Nile, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, Sindbis, and Rift Valley Fever viruses), most with substantial transmission in temperate regions. Transmission is optimized at intermediate temperatures (23–26˚ C) and often has wider thermal breadths (due to cooler lower thermal limits) compared to pathogens with predominately tropical distributions (in previous studies). The incidence of human West Nile virus cases across US counties responded unimodally to average summer temperature and peaked at 24˚C, matching model-predicted optima (24–25˚C). Climate warming will likely shift transmission of these diseases, increasing it in cooler locations while decreasing it in warmer locations. © Shocket et al.},

Adaptation can take many shapes and occur at different speeds, depending on the type of response, the trait, the population, and the environmental conditions. The biodiversity crisis that we are currently facing illustrates that numerous species and populations are not capable of adapting with sufficient speed to ongoing environmental changes. Here, we discuss current knowledge on the ability of animals and plants to adapt to environmental stress on different timescales, mainly focusing on thermal stress and ectotherms. We discuss within-generation responses that can be fast and induced within minutes or hours, evolutionary adaptations that are often slow and take several generations, and mechanisms that lay somewhere in between and that include epigenetic transgenerational effects. To understand and predict the impacts of environmental change and stress on biodiversity, we suggest that future studies should (1) have an increased focus on understanding the type and speed of responses to fast environmental changes; (2) focus on the importance of environmental fluctuations and the predictability of environmental conditions on adaptive capabilities, preferably in field studies encompassing several fitness components; and (3) look at ecosystem responses to environmental stress and their resilience when disturbed. © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.},

Informed conservation management requires improving the taxonomy of anurans to assess reliably the species' geographic range. The genus Odontophrynus that is geographically refined to Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay includes currently 12 nominal species with many populations of uncertain taxonomic assignment and subsequently unclear geographic ranges. In this study, we applied integrative taxonomic methods combining molecular (mitochondrial 16S gene), allozyme, morphological and bioacoustic data to delimit species of the genus Odontophrynus sampled from throughout Argentina where most species occur. The combined evidence demonstrates one case of cryptic diversity and another of overestimation of species richness. The populations referred to as O. americanus comprise at least three species. In contrast, O. achalensis and O. barrioi represent junior synonyms of the phenotypically plastic species O. occidentalis. We conclude that each of the four species occurring in Argentina inhabits medium to large areas. The Red List classification is currently "Least Concern".

	abstract = {Threatened species face numerous threats, including future challenges triggered by global change. A possible way to cope with these challenges is through adaptive evolution, which requires adaptive potential. Adaptive potential is defined as the genetic variance needed to respond to selection and can be assessed either on adaptive traits or fitness [1]. However, a lack of high-quality data has made it difficult to rigorously test adaptive potential in threatened species, leading to controversy over its magnitude [1–3]. Here we assess the adaptive potential of a threatened New Zealand passerine (the hihi, Notiomystis cincta) based on two populations: (1) the sole remaining natural population, on the island of Te Hauturu-o-Toi, and (2) a reintroduced population with a long-term dataset (intensively monitored for 20 years) based on the island of Tiritiri Matangi. We use molecular information (reduced representation genome sequencing, on both populations), as well as long-term phenotypic and fitness data from the Tiritiri Matangi population, to find (1) a lack of molecular genetic diversity at a genome-wide level in both populations, (2) low heritability of traits under selection and (3) negligible additive genetic variance of fitness in the Tiritiri Matangi population. In combination, these results support a lack of adaptive potential in this threatened species. We discuss our findings within the context of other passerines and methods for assessing adaptive potential, as well as the impact of these results on conservation practice, for the hihi and species of conservation concern in general. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd; de Villemereuil et al. investigate the adaptive potential of a threatened New Zealand bird (the hihi) using three different methods. They show that this species lacks diversity at the genomic level, heritability in a range of adaptive traits, and genetic variance in relative fitness, all signs of a strong lack of adaptive potential in this species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Specific root area (SRA) was higher in the control group (N0) than fertilized groups (N1, N2 and N3). Root tissue density (RTD) was higher in low N addition group (N1) than in the other group. Root dry matter content had no significant difference among four treatment groups. SRL, SRA, and RTD of fine roots in different diameter classes were all significantly different between highN addition (N3) and the control (N0) groups. The physiological characteristics of fine roots showed that soluble sugar (SS), fine root vitality (FRV), and tissue water content (TWC) in different soil layers were higher in the control group than in the fertilized groups.While soluble protein (SP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and free proline (FP) were lower in the control group (N0) than in the fertilized groups. In addition, SS, FRV, SP, TWC, FP, and MDA in all N addition treatments groups were significantly different from the control group. Fine root morphological traits were closely related to physiological traits, and added nitrogen inputs change these correlations. Our study confirms that nitrogen addition has specific effects on the morphological and physiological traits of fine roots of Schrenk's spruce, and the effects of N addition vary according to the amount added.

	abstract = {Little attention has been paid to how aquatic habitat characteristics affect the traits of plant species. Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm. is a keystone species distributed across temperate regions of Europe, northwest Africa and western Asia. Its apparently low phenotypic variability compared to other aquatic plants led us to test whether the species exhibited significant phenotypic variability and whether trait values correlated to environmental parameters. The hypotheses were that (1) the environmental variation within our set of wetlands (both water and sediment characteristics) led to significant variation among four sets of traits related respectively to growth, reproduction, defence and storage and (2) that nutrient limitation (nitrogen and especially phosphorus) should affect plant traits towards a higher investment in storage and defence and a lower investment in growth and reproduction, thereby negatively affecting the success of N. lutea. To test these hypotheses, 11 populations of N. lutea were sampled in wetlands differing in physicochemical characteristics and spread along three rivers. A total of 15 traits, grouped into four sets (growth, reproduction, storage and defence), were measured during the growing season. Most N. lutea traits were related to the environmental characteristics of wetlands. The growth and reproduction traits were mostly positively related to habitat resource conditions, whereas the defence traits were positively correlated with both ammonium concentration and temperature, outlining possible anoxic stress (habitat adversity). Nitrogen or phosphorus limitation led to the variation of only a few traits: the rhizome starch content was higher in phosphorus-limited wetlands, while the rhizome length and volume, and the number of flowers were higher in nitrogen-limited wetlands.

	abstract = {Background: Trachycarpus fortunei has broad economic benefits and excellent drought resistance; however, its drought response, adaptation, and recovery processes remain unclear. Methodology: In this study, the response, tolerance, and recovery processes of T. fortunei leaves and roots under drought stress were determined by Illumina sequencing. Results: Under drought stress, T. fortunei reduced its light-capturing ability and composition of its photosynthetic apparatus, thereby reducing photosynthesis to prevent photo-induced chloroplast reactive oxygen damage during dehydration. The phenylpropanoid biosynthesis process in the roots was suppressed, DHNs, LEA, Annexin D2, NAC, and other genes, which may play important roles in protecting the cell membrane's permeability in T. fortunei root tissues. During the rehydration phase, fatty acid biosynthesis in T. fortunei roots was repressed. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) screened modules that were positively or negatively correlated with physiological traits. The real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results indicated the reliability of the transcriptomic data. Conclusion: These findings provide valuable information for identifying important components in the T. fortunei drought signaling network and enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which T. fortunei responds to drought stress.  © 2021 Feng et al.},

	abstract = {Intercropping may improve community stability and yield under climate change. Here, we set up a field experiment to evaluate the advantages of cultivating Z anthoxylum bungeanum with Capsicum annum, and Z. bungeanum with Glycine max as intercrops, compared with cultivating Z. bungeanum in monoculture. Effects of extreme drought stress conditions on morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits of the three crop species cultivated in the three contrasting planting systems were compared. Results showed that extreme drought conditions induced negative impacts on Z. bungeanum grown in monoculture, due to reduced growth and metabolic impairment. However, limited stomatal conductance, reduced transpiration rate (Tr), and increased water use efficiency, carotenoid content, catalase activity, and accumulation of soluble sugars in Z. bungeanum indicated its adaptive strategies for tolerance of extreme drought stress conditions. Compared with cultivation in monoculture, intercropping with C. annum had positive effects on Z. bungeanum under extreme drought stress conditions, as a result of improved crown diameter, leaf relative water content (LRWC), net photosynthetic rate, and proline content, while intercropping with G. max under extreme drought stress conditions increased net CO2 assimilation rates, LRWC, Tr, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. In conclusion, Z. bungeanum has an effective defense mechanism for extreme drought stress tolerance. Intercropping with G. max enhanced this tolerance potential primarily through its physio-biochemical adjustments, rather than as a result of nitrogen fixation by G. max. Copyright 2020 Li et al.},

	abstract = {Changes in soil bacterial communities, which are crucial for the assessment of ecological restoration in Chinese plantations, have never been studied in the ‘‘Three North Shelterbelt’’ project in the semi-arid areas. We used high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene to investigate the soil bacterial community diversity, structure, and functional characteristics in three plantation forests, including Populus × canadensis Moench (PC), Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (PS), and Pinus tabuliformis (PT). In addition, soil environment factors were measured. There were distinct differences in soil characteristics among different plantation forests. Compared to PS and PT, PC had a higher soil pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and available P, as well as a lower C/N ratio. Furthermore, afforestation with different tree species significantly altered the abundance of Proteobacteria, and Chloroflexi in the soil, and its influence on the bacterial diversity indices. The bacterial community compositions and functional groups related to C and N cycling from PS, and PT were grouped tightly, indicating that the soil bacterial phylogenetic distance of PS and PT were closer than that between PS plus PT and PC. Our results implied that the soil characteristics, as well as the diversity, compositions and functions related to C and N cycling of soil bacterial community obviously differed from the following afforestation, especially between PC and PS plus PT, which in turn enormously established the correlation between the soil microbial community characteristics and the afforestation tree species.

Drosophila tumors exhibit traits characteristic of human cancers, providing a powerful model to study developmental and cancer biology. We now find that cells derived from Drosophila eye-disc tumors also display organ-specific metastasis, invading receptive organs but not wing disc. Toll receptors are known to affect innate immunity and the tumor inflammatory microenvironment by modulating the NF-κB pathway. Our RNA interference (RNAi) screen and genetic analyses show that Toll-6 is required for migration and invasion of the tumor cells. Further, receptive organs express Toll ligands [Spätzle (Spz) family molecules], and ectopic Spz expression renders the wing disc receptive to metastasis. Finally, Toll-6 promotes metastasis by activating JNK signaling, a key regulator of cell migration. Hence, we report Toll-6 and Spz as a new pair of guidance molecules mediating organ-specific metastatic behavior and highlight a novel signaling mechanism for Toll-family receptors. © 2019.

	abstract = {Background. Freshwater turtle populations are vulnerable to a range of human activities because of particular life history attributes, and anthropogenic impacts can cause shifts in demographic traits, including survival, density and population structure. Asian freshwater turtles have undergone dramatic population declines in recent decades principally because of collection for food, pet, and traditional medicine markets. Despite this, few studies have been conducted on the population demography of these turtles, thereby limiting our understanding of population trends and the development of conservation actions. Oldham's leaf turtle (Cyclemys oldhamii) is one of the most commonly traded turtles in Asian markets, but previous published studies have focused solely on systematics. Methods. We conducted a mark-recapture study of C. oldhamii at three sites in northeastern Thailand-a protected stream, a degraded stream, and human-constructed ponds-and evaluated differences in survival, density, population structure, and sexual dimorphism among sites. Results. We captured 77 turtles at the protected stream, 67 at the constructed ponds, and two in the degraded stream. Survival was 12% lower and density was 35% lower in the constructed ponds than in the protected stream. Size class structure was skewed toward smaller individuals at the constructed ponds, and both sites exhibited subadult-skewed age class structure. Sex ratios were not statistically different than 1:1 at either site and did not differ between sites. We did not document sexual dimorphism in either population. Discussion. Explanations for lower survival, lower densities, and skewed size class structure at the constructed ponds include collection for consumption or Buddhist prayer release locally, collection for illegal export from Thailand, predation by domestic dogs associated with humans living nearby, or lower habitat quality. Evidence from our study suggests that collection, either for local use or export, is the most likely explanation for differences in demographic characteristics between the two sites. The information gained from this study may contribute to a status assessment for C. oldhamii and development of conservation actions should they become necessary to protect populations in Thailand. © Copyright 2019 Seateun et al.},

	abstract = {Many theoretical studies of range expansions focus on the dynamics of species’ ranges or on causes and consequences of biological invasions. The similarities between biological range expansions and the dynamics of tumour growth have recently become more obvious, highlighting that tumours can be viewed as a population of abnormal cells expanding its range in the body of its host. Here, we discuss the potential of recent theoretical developments in the context of range expansions to shed light on intra-tumour heterogeneity, and to develop novel computational and statistical methods for studying the increasingly available genomic and phenotypic data from tumour cells. We review two spatial eco-evolutionary processes that could lead to a better understanding of the spatial structure of intra-tumour heterogeneity during the development of solid tumours: (1) the increase in dispersal abilities and (2) the accumulation of deleterious mutations at the front of expanding range edges. We first summarize theoretical and empirical evidences for each of these two phenomena and illustrate the eco-evolutionary dynamics of these processes using mathematical models. Secondly, we review evidences that these phenomena could also occur during the spatial expansion of a tumour within hosts. Finally, we discuss promising avenues for future research with the aim of synthesizing insights from clinical and theoretical studies of tumour development and evolutionary biology. © 2018, Society for Mathematical Biology.},

	abstract = {The cold-climate hypothesis maintains that viviparity arose as a means to prevent increased egg mortality in nests owing to low temperatures, and this hypothesis represents the primary and most strongly supported explanation for the evolution of viviparity in reptiles. In this regard, certain authors have stated that viviparous species will exhibit speciation via climatic niche conservatism, with similar climatic niches being observed in allopatric sister species. However, this prediction remains to be tested with bioclimatic variables relevant to each viviparous group. In the present study, we examined climatic niche evolution in a group of North American viviparous lizards to determine whether their diversification is linked to phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC). We evaluated the phylogenetic signal and trait evolution of individual bioclimatic variables and principal component (PC) scores of a PC analysis, along with reconstructions of ancestral climate tolerances. The results suggest that diversification of the Sceloporus torquatus group species is associated with both niche differentiation and PNC. Furthermore, we did not observe PNC across nearly all bioclimatic variables and in PC2 and PC3. However, in Precipitation Seasonality (Bio15), in Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (Bio19) and in PC1 (weakly associated with variability of temperature), we did observe PNC. Additionally, variation of the scores along the phylogeny and Pagel’s delta (d) >1 of PC3 suggests a fast, recent evolution to dry conditions in the clade that sustains S. serrifer.

	abstract = {Background. Global warming can cause variation in plant functional traits due to phenotypic plasticity or rapid microevolutionary change. Seed mass represents a fundamental axis of trait variation in plants, from an individual to a community scale. Here, we hypothesize that long-term warming can shift the mean seed mass of species. Methods. We tested our hypothesis in plots that had been warmed over 18 years in alpine meadow communities with a history of light grazing (LG) and heavy grazing (HG) on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. In this study, seeds were collected during the growing season of 2015. Results. We found that warming increased the mean seed mass of 4 (n=19) species in the LG meadow and 6 (n = 20) species in the HG meadow, while decreasing the mean seed mass of 6 species in the LG and HG meadows, respectively. For 7 species, grazing history modified the effect of warming on seed mass. Therefore, we concluded that long-term warming can shift the mean seed mass at the species level. However, the direction of this variation is species-specific. Our study suggests that mean seed mass of alpine plant species appears to decrease in warmer (less stressful) habitats based on lifehistory theory, but it also suggests there may be an underlying trade-off in which mean seed mass may increase due to greater thermal energy inputs into seed development. Furthermore, the physical and biotic environment modulating this trade-off result in complex patterns of variation in mean seed mass of alpine plant species facing global warming.

	abstract = {High external nitrogen (N) inputs can maximize maize yield but can cause a subsequent reduction in N use efficiency (NUE). Thus, it is necessary to identify the minimum effective N fertilizer input that does not affect maize grain yield (GY) and to investigate the photosynthetic and root system consequences of this optimal dose. We conducted a 4-year field experiment from 2014 to 2017 with four N application rates: 300 (N300), 225 (N225), 150 (N150), and 0 Kg ha−1 (N0) in the Northwest of China. GY was assessed by measuring the photosynthetic capacity and root system (root volume, surface area, length density and distribution). Grain yield decreased by −3%, 7.7%, and 21.9% when the N application rates decreased by 25%, 50%, and 100% from 300 Kg ha−1. We found that yield reduction driven by N reduction was primarily due to decreased radiation use efficiency (RUE) and WUE instead of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation and evapotranspiration. In the N225 treatment, GY, WUE, and RUE were not significantly reduced, or in some cases, were greater than those of the N300 treatment. This pattern was also observed with relevant photosynthetic and root attributes (i.e., high net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and root weight, as well as deep root distribution). Our results suggest that application of N at 225 Kg ha−1 can increased yield by improving the RUE, WUE, and NUE in semi-arid regions. Copyright 2020 Su et al.

	abstract = {Background. The long-term success of ex-situ conservation programmes depends on species-appropriate husbandry and enrichment practices complemented by an accurate welfare assessment protocol. Zoos and conservation breeding programmes should employ a bottom-up approach to account for intraspecific variations in measures of animal welfare. We studied 35 (14:21) captive Asiatic lions in Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden, Junagadh, India to understand the implications of individual variations on welfare measures. We categorized the subjects based on personality traits (bold or shy), rearing history (wild-rescued or captive-raised), sex, and social-grouping. We explored the association of these categorical variables on welfare indices such as behavioural diversity, latency to approach novel objects, enclosure usage and aberrant repetitive behaviours. Further, we assessed the inter-relationships betweeN =ifferent behavioural measures of welfare. Results. Our results show that intraspecific variations based on rearing-history and personality traits are significantly associated with the welfare states of captive Asiatic lions. Asiatic lions with bold personality traits (M = 0:50;SD = 0:12;N = 21) and those raised in captivity (M = 0:47;SD = 0:12;N = 16) used enclosure space more homogenously compared to shy (M = 0:71;SD = 0:15;N = 14) and wild-rescued (M =0:67;SD=0:15;N =19) animals. Behaviour diversity was significantly higher in captive-raised (M =1:26;SD=0:3;N =16) and bold (M =1:23;SD=0:26;N =21) subjects compared to wild-rescued (M = 0:83;SD = 0:35;N = 19) and shy (M = 0:73;SD=0:34;N =14) individuals. Aberrant repetitive behaviours (stereotypy) were significantly lower in bold (M = 7:01;SD = 4;N = 21) and captive-raised (M = 7:74;SD=5:3) individuals compared to wild-rescued (M =13:12;SD=6:25;N =19) and shy (M = 16:13;SD = 5:4;N = 16) lions. Sex and social-grouping of subjects did not show significant associations with behavioural welfare indices. Interestingly, behaviour diversity was reliably predicted by the enclosure usage patterns and aberrant repetitive behaviours displayed by subjects. Discussion. Our findings underline the importance of individual-centric, behaviour- based, and multi-dimensional welfare assessment approaches in ex-situ conservation programmes. The results suggest that behavioural welfare indices complemented with individual variations can explain inter-individual differences in behavioural welfare measure outcomes of Asiatic lions. These findings also provide zoo managers with a non-invasive tool to reliably assess and improve husbandry practices for Asiatic lions. Understanding the unique welfare requirement of individuals in captivity will be crucial for the survival of the species. © 2020 Goswami et al.},

	abstract = {Public interest in ecological landscaping and gardening is fueling a robust market for native plants. Most plants available to consumers through the horticulture trade are cultivated forms that have been selected for modified flowers or foliage, compactness, or other ornamental characteristics. Depending on their traits, some native plant cultivars seem to support pollinators, specialist insect folivores, and insect-based vertebrate food webs as effectively as native plant species, whereas others do not. There is particular need for information on whether native cultivars can be as effective as true or ''wild-type'' native species for supporting specialist native insects of conservation concern. Herein we compared the suitability of native milkweed species and their cultivars for attracting and supporting one such insect, the iconic monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus L.), as well as native bees in urban pollinator gardens. Wild-type Asclepias incarnata L. (swamp milkweed) and Asclepias tuberosa L. (butterfly milkweed) and three additional cultivars of each that vary in stature, floral display, and foliage color were grown in a replicated common garden experiment at a public arboretum. We monitored the plants for colonization by wild monarchs, assessed their suitability for supporting monarch larvae in greenhouse trials, measured their defensive characteristics (leaf trichome density, latex, and cardenolide levels), and compared the proportionate abundance and diversity of bee families and genera visiting their blooms. Significantly more monarch eggs and larvae were found on A. incarnata than A. tuberosa in both years, but within each milkweed group, cultivars were colonized to the same extent as wild types. Despite some differences in defense allocation, all cultivars were as suitable as wild-type milkweeds in supporting monarch larval growth. Five bee families and 17 genera were represented amongst the 2,436 total bees sampled from blooms of wild-type milkweeds and their cultivars in the replicated gardens. Bee assemblages of A. incarnata were dominated by Apidae (Bombus, Xylocopa spp., and Apis mellifera), whereas A. tuberosa attracted relatively more Halictidae (especially Lasioglossum spp.) and Megachilidae. Proportionate abundance of bee families and genera was generally similar for cultivars and their respective wild types. This study suggests that, at least in small urban gardens, milkweed cultivars can be as suitable as their parental species for supporting monarch butterflies and native bees.

	abstract = {New knowledge on soil structure highlights its importance for hydrology and soil organic matter (SOM) stabilization, which however remains neglected in many wide used models. We present here a new model, KEYLINK, in which soil structure is integrated with the existing concepts on SOM pools, and elements from food web models, that is, those from direct trophic interactions among soil organisms. KEYLINK is, therefore, an attempt to integrate soil functional diversity and food webs in predictions of soil carbon (C) and soil water balances. We present a selection of equations that can be used for most models as well as basic parameter intervals, for example, key pools, functional groups' biomasses and growth rates. Parameter distributions can be determined with Bayesian calibration, and here an example is presented for food web growth rate parameters for a pine forest in Belgium. We show how these added equations can improve the functioning of the model in describing known phenomena. For this, five test cases are given as simulation examples: changing the input litter quality (recalcitrance and carbon to nitrogen ratio), excluding predators, increasing pH and changing initial soil porosity. These results overall show how KEYLINK is able to simulate the known effects of these parameters and can simulate the linked effects of biopore formation, hydrology and aggregation on soil functioning. Furthermore, the results show an important trophic cascade effect of predation on the complete C cycle with repercussions on the soil structure as ecosystem engineers are predated, and on SOM turnover when predation on fungivore and bacterivore populations are reduced. In summary, KEYLINK shows how soil functional diversity and trophic organization and their role in C and water cycling in soils should be considered in order to improve our predictions on C sequestration and C emissions from soils. © 2021 PeerJ Inc..

To date, the discussion has focused on whether such group differences have any genetic basis, and if so, whether they are without fitness consequences and arose via random genetic drift, or whether they were driven by selection for different trait optima in different environments. Here, we highlight a plausible alternative: that many complex traits evolve under stabilizing selection in the face of shifting environmental effects. Under this scenario, there will be rapid evolution at the loci that contribute to trait variation, even when the trait optimum remains the same. These considerations underscore the strong assumptions about environmental effects that are required in ascribing trait differences among groups to genetic differences.

	abstract = {Temporal changes in body size have been documented in a number of vertebrate species, with different contested drivers being suggested to explain these changes. Among these are climate warming, resource availability, competition, predation risk, human population density, island effects and others. Both life history traits (intrinsic factors such as lifespan and reproductive rate) and habitat (extrinsic factors such as vegetation type, latitude and elevation) are expected to mediate the existence of a significant temporal response of body size to climate warming but neither have been widely investigated. Using examples of rodents, we predicted that both life history traits and habitat might explain the probability of temporal response using two tests of this hypothesis. Firstly, taking advantage of new data from museum collections spanning the last 106 years, we investigated geographical and temporal variation in cranial size (a proxy for body size) in six African rodent species of two murid subfamilies (Murinae and Gerbillinae) of varying life history, degree of commensality, range size, and habitat. Two species, the commensal Mastomys natalensis, and the non-commensal Otomys unisulcatus showed significant temporal changes in body size, with the former increasing and the latter decreasing, in relation with climate warming. Commensalism could explain the increase in size with time due to steadily increasing food availability through increased agricultural production. Apart from this, we found no general life history or habitat predictors of a temporal response in African rodents. Secondly, in order to further test this hypothesis, we incorporated our data into a meta-analysis based on published literature on temporal responses in rodents, resulting in a combined dataset for 50 species from seven families worldwide; among these, 29 species showed no significant change, eight showed a significant increase in size, and 13 showed a decline in size. Using a binomial logistic regression model for these metadata, we found that none of our chosen life history or habitat predictors could significantly explain the probability of a temporal response to climate warming, reinforcing our conclusion based on the more detailed data from the six African species.

	abstract = {Over 300 million arthropod specimens are housed in North American natural history collections. These collections represent a vast hidden treasure trove'' of biodiversity ..95% of the specimen label data have yet to be transcribed for research, and less than 2% of the specimens have been imaged. Specimen labels contain crucial information to determine species distributions over time and are essential for understanding patterns of ecology and evolution, which will help assess the growing biodiversity crisis driven by global change impacts. Specimen images offer indispensable insight and data for analyses of traits, and ecological and phylogenetic patterns of biodiversity. Here, we review North American arthropod collections using two key metrics, specimen holdings and digitization efforts, to assess the potential for collections to provide needed biodiversity data. We include data from 223 arthropod collections in North America, with an emphasis on the United States. Our specific findings are as follows: (1) The majority of North American natural history collections (88%) and specimens (89%) are located in the United States. Canada has comparable holdings to the United States relative to its estimated biodiversity. Mexico has made the furthest progress in terms of digitization, but its specimen holdings should be increased to reflect the estimated higher Mexican arthropod diversity. The proportion of North American collections that has been digitized, and the number of digital records available per species, are both much lower for arthropods when compared to chordates and plants. (2) The National Science Foundation's decade-long ADBC program (Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections) has been transformational in promoting arthropod digitization. However, even if this program became permanent, at current rates, by the year 2050 only 38% of the existing arthropod specimens would be digitized, and less than 1% would have associated digital images. (3) The number of specimens in collections has increased by approximately 1% per year over the past 30 years. We propose that this rate of increase is insufficient to provide enough data to address biodiversity research needs, and that arthropod collections should aim to triple their rate of new specimen acquisition. (4) The collections we surveyed in the United States vary broadly in a number of indicators. Collectively, there is depth and breadth, with smaller collections providing regional depth and larger collections providing greater global coverage. (5) Increased coordination across museums is needed for digitization efforts to target taxa for research and conservation goals and address long-term data needs. Two key recommendations emerge: collections should significantly increase both their specimen holdings and their digitization efforts to empower continental and global biodiversity data pipelines, and stimulate downstream research. © 2019 Cobb et al.},

	abstract = {Invasion facilitation, whereby one species has a positive effect on the establishment of another species, could help explain the rapid colonisation shown by some freshwater invasive species, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We employed two- choice test arenas to test whether the presence of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) could facilitate the establishment of the killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus). Killer shrimp preferred to settle on mats of zebra mussel, but this was unrelated to mat size, and was not different from attraction shown to artificial grass, suggesting that zebra mussel primarily provides substrate and refuge to the killer shrimp. Killer shrimp were strongly attracted to water scented by zebra mussel, but not to water scented by fish. Chemical attraction to the zebra mussel's scent did not differ between sympatric and allopatric populations of killer shrimp, suggesting that chemical attraction is not an acquired or learned trait. Our study shows, for the first time, chemical attraction between two highly invasive freshwater species, thereby providing a plausible mechanism for invasion facilitation. This has implications for managing the spread of killer shrimp, and perhaps other freshwater invasive species, because chemical attraction could significantly increase establishment success in mutualistic systems. Failure to consider invasion facilitation may underestimate the risk of establishment, and likely also the impact of some aquatic invaders. © 2019 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Changes in land use trigger environmental changes that can lead to decreased biodiversity and species loss. The liver is an essential detoxification organ that reflects systemic physiological responses to environmental changes. Here, we tested whether contrasting land use patterns influence the amount of substances from the hepatic cellular catabolism and melanomacrophages (MMs) of five anuran species in the Brazilian Cerrado. Methods: We collected the same five species of pond-dwelling frogs in one protected area and in an area with intense agricultural activity. We used routine histological and histochemical techniques to quantify the area occupied by lipofuscin, melanin, and hemosiderin in the liver of two frogs Leptodactylus fuscus, Physalaemus cuvieri, and three tree-frogs Dendropsophus minutus, Scinax fuscomarginatus, and Boana albopunctata. We classified land use types in a buffer around each pond based on satellite images. We then used a double-constrained Correspondence Analysis, a recently developed ecological method to relate functional traits to environmental variables, to test the effect of each land use type on the area of each liver pigment. Results: There was an increase in the amount of melanin in environments with high proportion of agriculture, as well as variation in the amount of lipofuscin and hemosiderin. Liver pigments of P. cuvieri and B. albopunctata varied more strongly in response to land use types, suggesting they could be good indicator species. Therefore, the area of MMs in the liver and the metabolic products in their cytoplasm can be used as biomarkers of environmental changes in regions with intense agricultural activities. Our results add a new perspective to the influence of land use patterns on environmental health by highlighting the effect of environmental changes on internal morphological aspects of animals. © 2020 Franco-Belussi et al.

UBE2T has been considered to be an oncogene in a variety of tumors. However, the oncogenic role of UBE2T in cervical cancer remains unclear. In this study, our results first showed that the expression of UBE2T was higher in both of cervical cancer tissues and cells than that in the normal tissues and cells. Knockdown of UBE2T reduced cervical cancer cell viability and suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration. However, overexpression of UBE2T contributed to cervical cancer cell growth and metastasis. Moreover, UBE2T overexpression cervical cancer cells demonstrated enhanced self-renewal capacity with upregulation of SOX2, Oct-4, and Nanog protein. Silencing of UBE2T downregulated protein expression of SOX2, Oct-4, and Nanog in cervical cancer cells reduced self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, ectopic UBE2T expression promoted protein expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation in cervical cancer cells. The knockdown of UBE2T reduced protein expression of GRP78 and FAK phosphorylation. Collectively, UBE2T promoted cervical cancer stem cell traits and exerted an oncogenic role through activation of the GRP78/FAK pathway.  © 2021 YanMei Liu et al., published by De Gruyter.},

To understand interactions of the well-known invasive plant siamweed (Chromolaena odorata) and its neighbors (exotic Praxelis clematidea and native cadillo) in South China, and their competitive mechanisms above- and belowground, a multicultivation experiment was conducted. Competitive indices, plant morphological traits, soil nutrient contents, enzyme activities, and microbial biomass were measured. Competitive balance index and morphological traits revealed balanced competition between P. clematidea and siamweed, and suppressive effect of siamweed on cadillo. In coculture of siamweed and P. clematidea, the branch length of siamweed slightly lengthened, while the branch number of P. clematidea increased compared with their respective monocultures accordingly. Overall impacts of the two invaders on soil properties were near averages of their single impacts. In coculture of siamweed and cadillo, siamweed was more competitive in both light and nutrient capture; soil urease activity and acid phosphatase activity were magnified and mitigated compared with the averages of those in their respective monocultures, respectively. The species-specific results of siamweed competing with its co-occurring weeds would contribute to a better understanding of mechanism in synergistic effect of siamweed with the other invasive plants. © 2020 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Background. Current and future changes in rainfall amount and frequency may particularly impact annual plants in desert ecosystems. The winter annual Echinops gmelinii Turcz. is widely distributed in the desert habitats of northern China and is a dominant pioneer annual plant following sand stabilization in the Tengger Desert. This species plays a vital role in dune stabilization during spring and early summer, when wind erosion is the most severe and frequent. However, seedling emergence and regeneration in sandy soil are mainly determined by rainfall patterns. Therefore, understanding the life history response of this species to rainfall variation is necessary for understanding the change of population dynamics under the future climate change. Methods. A field simulation rainfall pot experiment using rainout shelter was con- ducted that included five amounts and five frequencies of rainfall based on historical and predicted values to monitor the life history responses of E. gmelinii in a near-natural habitat. Results. We found that rainfall amount and frequency significantly affected seedling survival, growth and reproduction. The plant height, biomass, capitula number, seed number, seed mass and reproductive effort, but not the root/shoot ratio, significantly increased with increasing rainfall. Further, these traits exhibited the greatest response to low-frequency and larger rainfall events, especially the optimal rainfall frequency of 10-day intervals. Offspring seed germination showed increasing trends with decreasing rainfall, suggesting that the maternal effects may have occurred. Conclusions. Our study shows that the plasticity in growth and reproduction of E. gmelinii in response to rainfall variations may help it to gain dominance in the harsh and unpredictable desert environment. Furthermore, population development of this winter annual species should be promoted under the likely future scenarios of large rainfall events and increasing cool-season precipitation in temperate desert.

	abstract = {Brain functional disruption and cognitive shortfalls as consequences of neurodegeneration are among the most investigated aspects in current clinical research. Traditionally, specific anatomical and behavioral traits have been associated with neurodegeneration, thus directly translatable in clinical terms. However, these qualitative traits, do not account for the extensive information flow breakdown within the functional brain network that deeply affect cognitive skills. Behavioural variant Frontotemporal Dementia (bvFTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by behavioral and executive functions disturbances. Deviations from the physiological cognitive functioning can be accurately inferred and modeled from functional connectivity alterations. Although the need for unbiased metrics is still an open issue in imaging studies, the graph-theory approach applied to neuroimaging techniques is becoming popular in the study of brain dysfunction. In this work, we assessed the global connectivity and topological alterations among brain regions in bvFTD patients using a minimum spanning tree (MST) based analysis of resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data. Whilst several graph theoretical methods require arbitrary criteria (including the choice of network construction thresholds and weight normalization methods), MST is an unambiguous modeling solution, ensuring accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility. MST networks of 116 regions of interest (ROIs) were built on wavelet correlation matrices, extracted from 41 bvFTD patients and 39 healthy controls (HC). We observed a global fragmentation of the functional network backbone with severe disruption of information-flow highways. Frontotemporal areas were less compact, more isolated, and concentrated in less integrated structures, respect to healthy subjects. Our results reflected such complex breakdown of the frontal and temporal areas at both intra-regional and long-range connections. Our findings highlighted that MST, in conjunction with rs-fMRI data, was an effective method for quantifying and detecting functional brain network impairments, leading to characteristic bvFTD cognitive, social, and executive functions disorders. © 2019 Saba, Premi, Cristillo, Gazzina, Palluzzi, Zanetti, Gasparotti, Padovani, Borroni and Grassi.},

Characterisation of traits associated with such expansions provides insight into the selection pressures and evolutionary constraints that shape demographic and evolutionary responses. Here we investigate patterns in three components of wing morphology (size, shape, colour) often linked to dispersal ability and thermoregulation, along latitudinal gradients of range expansion in the Speckled Wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria) in Britain (two regions of expansion in England and Scotland). We measured 774 males from 54 sites spanning 799 km with a 10-year mean average temperature gradient of 4 ◦C. A geometric morphometric method was used to investigate variation in size and shape of forewings and hindwings; colour, pattern, and contrast of the wings were examined using a measure of lightness (inverse degree of melanism). Overall, wing size increased with latitude by ∼2% per 100 km, consistent with Bergmann’s rule. Forewings became more rounded and hindwings more elongated with history of colonisation, possibly reflecting selection for increased dispersal ability. Contrary to thermal melanism expectations, wing colour was lighter where larvae developed at cooler temperatures and unrelated to long-term temperature. Changes in wing spot pattern were also detected. High heterogeneity in variance among sites for all of the traits studied may reflect evolutionary time-lags and genetic drift due to colonisation of new habitats. Our study suggests that temperature-sensitive plastic responses for size and colour interact with selection for dispersal traits (wing size and shape). Whilst the plastic and evolutionary responses may in some cases act antagonistically, the rapid expansion of P. aegeria implies an overall reinforcing effect between these two mechanisms.

	abstract = {Community decline is often linked to anthropogenic activities. Coral reef declines, for example, have been linked to overfishing and climate change, but impacts of coastal development, pollution, and tourism have received increasing attention. Here, we isolated the impact of one little-studied aspect of recreational activity on coral reefs-damage from boat anchoring-by performing a survey of 24 sites in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) subject to varying levels of anchoring activity. The percent cover of hard corals and sea fans was reduced by a factor of-1.7 and-2.6 respectively at highly anchored sites. Hard coral colonies were 40% smaller in surface area and-60% less dense at sites experiencing high anchoring frequency. In addition, highly anchored sites supported only-60% of the species richness of little anchored sites. Frequently anchored sites were-60% as structurally complex and supported less than half as many fish as those rarely anchored, with 5 of 7 fish functional groups affected. Roughly 24% of BVI coral reef by area appears suitable for anchoring, suggesting that impacts associated with boat anchoring may be both locally severe and more pervasive than previously appreciated. © 2019 PeerJ Inc..

	abstract = {An environment-friendly technique for synthesizing biomass-based mesoporous activated carbon with high nitrogen-/oxygen-chelating adsorption for Cu(II) is proposed. Bagasse impregnated with phosphoric acid is utilized as the precursor. To pyrolyze the precursor, two separate heating modes are used: microwave pyrolysis and conventional electric-heating pyrolysis. The resulting bagasse-derived carbon samples are modified with nitrification and reduction modification. Nitrogen (N)/oxygen (O) functional groups are simultaneously introduced to the surface of activated carbon, enhancing its adsorption of Cu(II) by complexing and ion-exchange. Characterization and copper adsorption experiments are performed to investigate the physicochemical properties of four prepared carbon samples and determine which heating method favors the subsequent modification for doping of N/O functional groups. In this technique, based on analyzing data of nitrogen adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and batch adsorption experiments, it is proven that microwave-pyrolyzed carbon has more defect sites and, therefore, time-saving effective microwave pyrolysis contributes more N/O species to the carbon, although it leads to a lower specific surface area. This technique offers a promising route to synthesis adsorbents with higher nitrogen and oxygen content and a higher adsorption capacity of heavy-metal ions in wastewater remediation applications. © 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

	abstract = {Global warming is predicted to increase the frequency and or severity of many disturbances including cyclones, storms, and prolonged heatwaves. The coral reef at Lizard Island, part of the Great Barrier Reef, has been recently exposed to a sequence of severe tropical cyclones (i.e., Ita in 2014 and Nathan in 2015) and a coral bleaching in the year 2016. Reef fishes are an essential part of the coral reef ecosystem, and their abundance is thus a good marker to estimate the magnitude of such disturbances. Here, we examined whether the recent disturbances at Lizard Island had an impact on the coral reef fish communities. To do this, we examined fish survey data collected before and after the disturbances for potential changes in total fish density post-disturbance. Also, by sorting fish species into 11 functional groups based on their trophic level (i.e., diet), we further explored the density changes within each functional group. Our findings showed an overall decline of 68% in fish density post-disturbance, with a significant density decrease in nine of 11 trophic groups. These nine groups were: Browsers, corallivores, detritivores, excavator/scrapers, grazers, macro-invertivores, pisci-invertivores, planktivores, and spongivores. The piscivores, on the other hand, were the only "winners," wherein their density showed an increase post-disturbance. These changes within functional groups might have a further impact on the trophodynamics of the food web. In summary, our findings provide evidence that the fish assemblage on the reefs around Lizard Island was considerably affected by extreme weather events, leading to changes in the functional composition of the reef fish assemblage. © Copyright 2019 Triki and Bshary.},

	abstract = {Microhabitat selection is a key component of amphibian breeding biology and can be modulated in response to the features of breeding sites and the presence of predators. Despite invasive alien species being among the major threats to amphibians, there is limited information on the role of invasive species in shaping amphibians’ breeding microhabitat choice. The invasive red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is a major predator of amphibians’ larvae, including those of the brown frogs Rana dalmatina and Rana latastei. Although qualitative information about the spawning site preferences and breeding microhabitat choice of brown frogs is available in the literature, only a few studies performed quantitative analyses, and the relationship between microhabitat choice and the presence of alien predators has not been investigated yet. The aims of this study were: (1) to characterize the microhabitats selected for clutch deposition by R. dalmatina and R. latastei and (2) to test if the position and the aggregation of egg clutches differ in sites invaded or not invaded by P. clarkii. During spring 2017, we surveyed multiple times 15 breeding sites of both brown frogs in Northern Italy; in each site we assessed the features of the microhabitat where each egg clutch was laid, considering its position (distance from the shore, depth of the water column) and the degree of aggregation of clutches. In each site we also assessed the presence/absence of the invasive crayfish and the relative abundance in the breeding period. We detected egg clutches in all sites; the crayfish occurred in eight ponds. Our results showed substantial differences between the spawning microhabitat features of the two brown frogs: Rana latastei clutches showed a higher degree of aggregation and were associated with deeper areas of the ponds, while Rana dalmatina deposited more spaced out clutches in areas of the ponds that were less deep. For both species, spawning microhabitat features were not significantly different between sites with and without P. clarkii. Although we did not detect behavioural responses to P. clarkii in the choice of spawning microhabitat, additional studies are required to assess whether these frogs modulate other behavioural traits (e.g. during larval development) in response to the invasive predator. © Copyright 2020 Romagnoli et al.},

	abstract = {Biomedical and clinical sciences are experiencing a renewed interest in the fact that males and females differ in many anatomic, physiological, and behavioural traits. Sex differences in trait variability, however, are yet to receive similar recognition. In medical science, mammalian females are assumed to have higher trait variability due to estrous cycles (the ‘estrus-mediated variability hypothesis’); historically in biomedical research, females have been excluded for this reason. Contrastingly, evolutionary theory and associated data support the ‘greater male variability hypothesis’. Here, we test these competing hypotheses in 218 traits measured in >26,900 mice, using meta-analysis methods. Neither hypothesis could universally explain patterns in trait variability. Sex bias in variability was trait-dependent. While greater male variability was found in morphological traits, females were much more variable in immunological traits. Sex-specific variability has eco-evolutionary ramifications, including sex-dependent responses to climate change, as well as statistical implications including power analysis considering sex difference in variance. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

	abstract = {Background: Salinity is one of the most lethal abiotic stresses which affect multiple aspects of plant physiology. Natural variations in plant germplasm are a great resource that could be exploited for improvement in salt tolerance. Eruca sativa (E. sativa) exhibits tolerance to abiotic stresses. However, thorough evaluation of its salt stress tolerance and screening for traits that could be reliably applied for salt tolerance needs to be studied. The current study was designed to characterize 25 E. sativa accessions, originating from diverse geographical regions of Pakistan, for the salt stress tolerance. Methods: Salt stress (150 mM NaCl) was applied for 2 weeks to the plants at four leaf stage in hydroponics. Data of the following morpho-physiological traits were collected from control and treated plants of all the accessions: root length (RL), shoot length (SL), plant height (PH), leaf number (LN), leaf area (LA), fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), chlorophyl content (SPAD), electrolyte leakage (EL), relative water content (RWC), gas exchange parameters and mineral ion content. Salt tolerance was determined based on membership function value (MFV) of the tested traits. Results: Compared with control, the salt-stressed group had significantly reduced mean SL, RL, PH, LN, LA, FW, DW and SPAD. NaCl treatment triggered a slight increase in EL in few accessions. Mean RWC of control and treated groups were not significantly different although few accessions exhibited variation in this trait. Salt stress caused a significant reduction in photosynthesis rate (PR), transpiration rate (TR) and stomatal conductance (SC) but intercellular CO2 (Ci) was not significantly different between control and treated groups. Compared with control, the salt-stressed plants accumulated significantly higher Na+, K+ and Ca2+ while significantly lower Mg2+. K+/Na+ ratio was significantly decreased in salt-stressed plants compared with control. Importantly, significant inter-accession variations were found for all the tested traits. The principal component analysis identified SL, RL, PH, LN, LA, FW, DW and PR as the most significant traits for resolving inter-accession variability. Based on MFV of the tested traits, accessions were categorized into five standard groups. Among 25 accessions, one accession was ranked as highly tolerant, four as tolerant while 15 accessions were ranked as moderately tolerant. Of the remaining five accessions, four were ranked as sensitive while one accession as highly sensitive. Conclusion: E. sativa accessions were found to exhibit significant genetic diversity in all the tested traits. A few most significant traits for dissecting the genetic variability were identified that could be used for future large-scale germplasm screening in E. sativa. Salt tolerant accessions could be a good resource for future breeding programs aiming to improve salt stress tolerance. © 2020 Afsar et al.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are the most diverse habitats in the marine realm. Their productivity, structural complexity, and biodiversity critically depend on ecosystem services provided by corals that are threatened because of climate change effects—in particular, ocean warming and acidification. The coral holobiont is composed of the coral animal host, endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, associated viruses, bacteria, and other microeukaryotes. In particular, the mandatory photosymbiosis with microalgae of the family Symbiodiniaceae and its consequences on the evolution, physiology, and stress resilience of the coral holobiont have yet to be fully elucidated. The functioning of the holobiont as a whole is largely unknown, although bacteria and viruses are presumed to play roles in metabolic interactions, immunity, and stress tolerance. In the context of climate change and anthropogenic threats on coral reef ecosystems, the Tara Pacific project aims to provide a baseline of the “-omics” complexity of the coral holobiont and its ecosystem across the Pacific Ocean and for various oceanographically distinct defined areas. Inspired by the previous Tara Oceans expeditions, the Tara Pacific expedition (2016–2018) has applied a pan-ecosystemic approach on coral reefs throughout the Pacific Ocean, drawing an east–west transect from Panama to Papua New Guinea and a south–north transect from Australia to Japan, sampling corals throughout 32 island systems with local replicates. Tara Pacific has developed and applied state-of-the-art technologies in very-high-throughput genetic sequencing and molecular analysis to reveal the entire microbial and chemical diversity as well as functional traits associated with coral holobionts, together with various measures on environmental forcing. This ambitious project aims at revealing a massive amount of novel biodiversity, shedding light on the complex links between genomes, transcriptomes, metabolomes, organisms, and ecosystem functions in coral reefs and providing a reference of the biological state of modern coral reefs in the Anthropocene.

	abstract = {Invasion of healthy tissue is a defining feature of malignant tumours. Traditionally, invasion is thought to be driven by cells that have acquired all the necessary traits to overcome the range of biological and physical defences employed by the body. However, in light of the ever-increasing evidence for geno- and phenotypic intra-tumour heterogeneity, an alternative hypothesis presents itself: could invasion be driven by a collection of cells with distinct traits that together facilitate the invasion process? In this paper, we use a mathematical model to assess the feasibility of this hypothesis in the context of acid-mediated invasion. We assume tumour expansion is obstructed by stroma which inhibits growth and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) which blocks cancer cell movement. Further, we assume that there are two types of cancer cells: (i) a glycolytic phenotype which produces acid that kills stromal cells and (ii) a matrix-degrading phenotype that locally remodels the ECM. We extend the Gatenby–Gawlinski reaction–diffusion model to derive a system of five coupled reaction–diffusion equations to describe the resulting invasion process. We characterise the spatially homogeneous steady states and carry out a simulation study in one spatial dimension to determine how the tumour develops as we vary the strength of competition between the two phenotypes. We find that overall tumour growth is most extensive when both cell types can stably coexist, since this allows the cells to locally mix and benefit most from the combination of traits. In contrast, when inter-species competition exceeds intra-species competition the populations spatially separate and invasion arrests either: (i) rapidly (matrix-degraders dominate) or (ii) slowly (acid-producers dominate). Overall, our work demonstrates that the spatial and ecological relationship between a heterogeneous population of tumour cells is a key factor in determining their ability to cooperate. Specifically, we predict that tumours in which different phenotypes coexist stably are more invasive than tumours in which phenotypes are spatially separated. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Pine beetles are well known in North America for their widespread devastation of pine forests. However, Dendroctonus valens LeConte is an important invasive forest pest in China also. Adults and larvae of this bark beetle mainly winter at the trunks and roots of Pinus tabuliformis and Pinus sylvestris; larvae, in particular, result in pine weakness or even death. Since the species was introduced from the United States to Shanxi in 1998, its distribution has spread northward. In 2017, it invaded a large area at the junction of Liaoning, Inner Mongolia and Hebei provinces, showing strong cold tolerance. To identify genes relevant to cold tolerance and the process of overwintering, we sequenced the transcriptomes of wintering and non-wintering adult and larval D. valens using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Differential expression analysis methods for other non-model organisms were used to compare transcript abundances in adults and larvae at two time periods, followed by the identification of functions and metabolic pathways related to genes associated with cold tolerance. We detected 4,387 and 6,091 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sampling dates in larvae and adults, respectively, and 1,140 common DEGs, including genes encoding protein phosphatase, very long-chain fatty acids protein, cytochrome P450, and putative leucine-rich repeat-containing proteins. In a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, 1,140 genes were assigned to 44 terms, with significant enrichment for cellulase activity, hydrolase activity, and carbohydrate metabolism. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) classification and enrichment analyses showed that the lysosomal and purine metabolism pathways involved the most DEGs, the highly enriched terms included autophagy-animal, pentose and glucuronate interconversions and lysosomal processes. We identified 140 candidate genes associated with cold tolerance, including genes with established roles in this trait (e.g., genes encoding trehalose transporter, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and trehalase). Our comparative transcriptome analysis of adult and larval D. valens in different conditions provides basic data for the discovery of key genes and molecular mechanisms underlying cold tolerance.  © 2021 Zhao et al.},

	abstract = {Habitat properties, including crop type, farming system, management practices, or topographic features such as the hillside aspect, may act as environmental filters that select organisms sharing traits compatible with those conditions. The more environmentally-friendly management practices implemented in organic farming seem to benefit a range of taxa, but the extent of those benefits is not well understood. In cherry orchards of the Jerte Valley (Extremadura, western Spain), we explored the response of spider assemblages to the farming system (organic and conventional) and the hillside aspect (sunny or shady) from a taxonomical, behavioral, and morphological perspective. Spiders from both the canopy and soil surface were collected and identified to family. According to their foraging strategy, spiders were sorted in guilds and, for a selected family in each guild, body size was measured on each captured individual. Spider traits and composition were determined by local factors derived from farming system, and by climate conditions associated to the hillside aspect. In taxonomical terms, spiders benefit from organic farming and by the shady aspect. However, from a behavioral perspective, spiders with different foraging strategies exhibit strong variations in their response to the evaluated factors. From a morphological perspective, body size within guilds is differently conditioned by management practices that constitute conditioning disturbance events for each guild, resulting in selecting small individuals. The observed differences in taxonomical, behavioral, and morphological responses of spider communities to habitat properties highlight the importance of examining their assemblages from different perspectives when assessing how they respond to changes in management practices and topographic features. © 2020 Rosas-Ramos et al.},

We further consider how populations can evolve to new optima, fail to evolve and therefore remain maladapted, or become further maladapted through trait-driven or eco–evo-driven mechanisms after being displaced from their fitness optima. Our goal is to stimulate thinking about evolution as a “double-edged sword” that comprises both adaptive and maladaptive responses, rather than as a “silver bullet” or a purely adaptive mechanism to combat global change. We conclude by discussing how a better appreciation of environmentally driven maladaptation and maladaptive responses might improve our current understanding of population responses to global change and our ability to forecast future responses. © 2020 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {During its reproductive phase, rice is susceptible to heat stress. Heat events will occur at all stages during the reproductive phase of rice as a result of global warming. Moreover, rice yield traits respond differently to heat stress during panicle initiation, flowering and grain filling. The reduction in the number of spikelets per panicle of heat-stressed plants is due to the attenuated differentiation of secondary branches and their attached florets as well as the promotion of their degradation during the panicle-initiation stage but is not affected by heat stress thereafter. Spikelet sterility as a result of heat stress is attributed not only to physiological abnormalities in the reproductive organs during the flowering stage but also to structural and morphological abnormalities in reproductive organs during the panicle-initiation stage. The reduced grain weight of heat-stressed plants is due to a reduction in nonstructural carbohydrates, undeveloped vascular bundles, and a reduction in glume size during the panicle-initiation stage, while a shortened grain-filling duration, reduced grain-filling rate, and decreased grain width contribute to reduced grain weight during the grain-filling stage. Thus, screening and breeding rice varieties that have comprehensive tolerance to heat stress at all time points during their reproductive stage may be possible to withstand unpredictable heat events in the future. The responses of yield traits to heat stress are regulated by phytohormone levels, which are determined by phytohormone homeostasis. Currently, the biosynthesis and transport of phytohormones are the key processes that determine phytohormone levels in and grain yield of rice under heat stress. Studies on phytohormone homeostatic responses are needed to further reveal the key processes that determine phytohormone levels under heat conditions. Copyright 2019 Wu et al.},

The effects of simulated drought stress on germination parameters were tested for tolerance and sensitivity in 59 barley accessions from all regions of Iraq and phenotypic, physiological, and biochemical responses associated with drought stress were investigated. Stress treatments with polyethylene glycol (PEG) reduced the germination rate and dramatically delayed the development of the seedlings. Significant changes in the physiological and biochemical profiles in barley accessions were observed. A smaller reduction in water absorption of seeds was observed across all accessions, while all biochemical characteristics except total flavonoid content were increased with the increase in water deficiency in most accessions. Among the 59 barley accessions, ABN was the most tolerant accession, while Black-Garmiyan was the most drought-prone. Significant relationships were found between most trait pairs, with 24 significant associations under no stress, 39 significant correlations under the 10.25% PEG treatment, and 60 significant correlations under the 20.50% PEG treatment. According to the key importance analysis, seed water uptake, total phenol content, soluble sugar content, and catalase are classified as relative significance traits for germination percentage, root and shoot length under stress conditions. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Silkworm pupae is the main by-product of the sericulture industry with an interesting nutritional profile, especially in terms of proteins. In consideration of its possible use as a food or food ingredient in Western countries, a comparative proteomic experiment has been performed to investigate the differences of the protein profile of male and female silkworm pupae reared on mulberry leaves or on an artificial diet. Methods: The nutritional profile of lyophilized silkworm pupae in terms of dry matter and ash was evaluated according to the AOAC procedures, the total nitrogen content was determined by a nitrogen analyzer and the silkworm pupae gross energy value was measured using an adiabatic calorimetric bomb. The comparative proteomic analysis was performed on male and female silkworm pupae reared on mulberry leaves or on the artificial diet. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and, after a multivariate statistical analysis, the differentially expressed proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS. Results: The comparative proteomic approach highlighted 47 silkworm pupae proteins differentially expressed comparing diet and gender. PCA analysis showed that seven proteins were more effective in discriminating the sex and five were more effective in discriminating the diet type. In spite of the above-mentioned differences in the silkworm pupae protein profile, no strong alteration of the pupa physiological traits have been demonstrated, suggesting a general silkworm pupae flexibility to adapt to a well-balanced artificial diet. Differences in lipid transport and metabolism were found among the experimental groups, that might have a relevant effect on the timing and on hormone secretion. This aspect may also affect silk production, as univoltine strains are the most productive. The proteomic data provided in this work, may offer a contribution in understanding also the influence ofgender and farming strategy on the allergen profile of Bombyx mori, when used as food or as a food ingredient. Female silkworm pupae reared on mulberry leaves seemed to contain lower levels of known allergens than those reared in the other experimental conditions; these findings will have to be taken into account when farming B. mori for food production purposes. However, our results need to be supported by further characterization of the allergenic potential of B. mori. © 2019 Lamberti et al.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are being absorbed by the oceans, a process known as ocean acidification, and risks adversely affecting a variety of behaviours in a range of marine species, including inhibited learning in some fishes. However, the effects of elevated CO2 on learning in advanced invertebrates such as cephalopods are unknown. Any impacts to the learning abilities of cephalopods could have far-reaching consequences for their populations and the communities they inhabit. Cephalopods have some of the most advanced cognitive abilities among invertebrates and are one of the few invertebrate taxa in which conditional discrimination has been demonstrated, though the trait has not been demonstrated in any species of squid. Here, we tested for the first time the capacity for conditional discrimination in a squid species (Sepioteuthis lessoniana). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of projected future CO2 levels (1,084 µatm) on conditional discrimination and learning more generally. A three-task experiment within a two-choice arena was used to test learning and conditional discrimination. Learning was measured by improvements in task completion in repeated trials over time and the number of trials required to pass each task. Squid exhibited significant learning capabilities, with an increase in correct choices over successive trials and a decrease in the number of trials needed to complete the successive tasks. Six of the 12 squid tested successfully passed all three tasks indicating a capacity for conditional discrimination in the species. Elevated CO2 had no effect on learning or on the capacity for conditional discrimination in squid. This study highlights the remarkable cognitive abilities of S. lessoniana, demonstrated by their capacity for conditional discrimination, and suggests that ocean acidification will not compromise learning abilities. However, other behavioural traits in the species have been shown to be altered at comparable elevated CO2 conditions. It is not clear why some ecologically important behaviours are altered by elevated CO2 whereas others are unaffected. Future research should focus on the physiological mechanism responsible for altered behaviours in squid at elevated CO2 Copyright 2020 Spady and Watson.},

	abstract = {Breeding high-yielding and nitrogen-efficient maize (Zea mays L.) hybrid varieties is a strategy that could simultaneously solve the problems of resource shortages and environmental pollution. We conducted a 2-year field study using four nitrogen application rates (0, 150, 225, and 300 kg N hm-2) and two maize hybrid varieties (ZD958 and QS101) to understand the plant traits related to high grain yields and high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). We found that ZD958 had a higher grain yield and nitrogen accumulation in the shoots at harvest as well as a higher NUE at lower nitrogen application rates (0 and 150 kg hm-2) than QS101. The grain yields and NUE were almost identical for the two hybrid varieties at nitrogen application rates of 225 and 300 kg N hm-2. Compared with QS101, ZD958 had higher above-ground and below- ground biomass amounts, a deeper root distribution, longer root length, root active absorption area, greater grain filling rate, and higher photosynthetic NUE than QS101 at lower nitrogen application rates. Our results showed that ZD958 can maintain a higher grain yield at lower nitrogen rates in a similar manner to N-efficient maize hybrid varieties. The selection of hybrids such as ZD958 with a deeper root distribution and higher photosynthetic NUE can increase the grain yield and NUE under low nitrogen conditions. © 2019 Su et al.},

The following describes the fate of terms used to denote sensory association neuropils in crustacean species and relates how those terms were deployed in the 1920s and 1930s by the Swedish neuroanatomist Bertil Hanström to claim homology in insects and crustaceans.

	abstract = {Forests absorb a large fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emission, but their ability to continue to act as a sink under climate change depends in part on plant species undergoing rapid adaptation. Yet models of forest response to climate change currently ignore local adaptation as a response mechanism. Thus, considering the evolution of intraspecific trait variation is necessary for reliable, long-term species and climate projections. Here, we combine ecophysiology and predictive climate modeling with analyses of genomic variation to determine whether sugar and starch storage, energy reserves for trees under extreme conditions, have the heritable variation and genetic diversity necessary to evolve in response to climate change within populations of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). Despite current patterns of local adaptation and extensive range-wide heritable variation in storage, we demonstrate that adaptive evolution in response to climate change will be limited by a lack of heritable variation within northern populations and by a need for extreme genetic changes in southern populations. Our method can help design more targeted species management interventions and highlights the power of using genomic tools in ecological prediction to scale from molecular to regional processes to determine the ability of a species to respond to future climates. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd; Blumstein et al. show variation in NSC storage in trees is heritable and locally adapted to climate.

	abstract = {On the temperate lowland plain of the lower Tumen River, agricultural development has converted most marshland into paddy fields. However, the locations of old paddy fields in the lowland temperate zone, where the vegetation structure is dominated by herbs adapted to seasonally wet or waterlogged conditions, are poorly known, and the impact of land use history on marshland diversity and shifts in plant functional groups has been scantly researched. In this study, we used a chronosequence approach to investigate herbaceous wetland communities in different recovery phases (<5 years, 5-15 years, and >15 years), as well as natural wetland as a reference. We assessed their ecological characteristics, species composition and diversity to determine how they change during natural succession. Plant species composition and dominance in the abandoned fields changed markedly during natural secondary succession. Initially, the annual weeds Echinochloa crus-galli and Bidens tripartita were dominant. Later, communities gradually became dominated first by Polygonum thunbergii and then by tussock-forming Carex rostrata. Species diversity was higher in abandoned fields than in natural wetlands and decreased with time. The partition of-diversity components revealed that replacement was the prominent process structuring plant communities in paddy field at different times since abandonment. Our results suggest that the vegetation of abandoned paddy fields could be restored effectively through natural succession, although there were some differences in plant functional group traits.

	abstract = {Suspension feeders play pivotal roles in the nutrient cycling of almost all aquatic ecosystems. Since sufficiently large differences in the filter mesh size (FMS) can lead to different food web positions, the inter- and intraspecific variability of this trait might be of community-level importance. The aim of this study was to quantify the range of FMS variation within the three invasive Ponto-Caspian Chelicorophium species based on a large material representing various conditions (1,224 specimens from 40 samples across Central Europe), characterize the components of variation within populations, identify the main factors determining intraspecific differences, and reveal how intraspecific variation affects the FMS overlaps among species. The FMS of the most widespread invader, C. curvispinum, varied within the broadest range (between 2.34–8.28 mm, compared to 2.51–5.97 mm in C. robustum and 1.08–3.23 mm in C. sowinskyi); nevertheless, the contribution of intraspecific plasticity to the invasion success of the species is not evident based on the present study. The within-individual variability of FMS increased with the individual mean of the trait and decreased with body size; however, it showed little differences among samples. The among-individual variation within samples could be partitioned into components related to body size (ontogenetic niche shift/differences among cohorts) and sex (ecological sexual dimorphism) as well as a seemingly random component (individual specialization), varying widely in extent and relative contributions. The FMS of C. curvispinum was significantly larger in the presence of C. sowinskyi than in allopatry, likely reflecting character displacement; however, it did not show further increase when C. robustum was also present. Similar differences could not be observed in C. sowinskyi. The FMS ranges of C. curvispinum and C. robustum never overlapped with that of C. sowinskyi in co-occurrence despite the considerable intraspecific differences among sites, suggesting that their interaction can be seen as a clear case of niche differentiation by food particle size. On the contrary, the strong overlaps observed between C. curvispinum and C. robustum indicate that other factors might play the primary role in their coexistence. The studied species appear to be suitable model organisms for identifying the drivers and mechanisms of FMS variability. © 2021 PeerJ Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {While intercropping is known to have positive effects on crop productivity, it is unclear whether the effects of mixing species start at the early plant stage, that is, during germination. We tested whether the germination of two legume species, alsike clover and black medic, characterized by a contrasting response to water availability and temperature is affected by mixing. We set up four experiments in each of which we compared a 1:1 mixture against the two monocultures, and combined this with various other experimental factors. These additional factors were (i) varied seed densities (50%, 100% and 150% of a reference density) in two field trials in 2016 and 2017, (ii) varied seed densities (high and low) and water availability (six levels, between 25% and 100% of water holding capacity (WHC)) in a greenhouse pot trial, (iii) varied seed spacing in a climate chamber, and (iv) varied temperatures (12 °C, 20 °C and 28 °C) and water availability (four levels between 25% and 100% of WHC) in a climate chamber. Across all experiments, the absolute mixture effects (AME) on germination ranged between -9% and +11%, with a median of +1.3%. Within experiments, significant mixture effects were observed, but the direction of these effects was inconsistent. In the field, AME on germination was significantly negative at some of the tested seed densities. A positive AME was observed in the climate chamber at 12 °C, and the mean AME decreased with increasing temperature. Higher density was associated with decreased germination in the field, indicating negative interaction through competition or allelopathy, among seedlings. Our findings indicate that interaction among seeds in species mixtures may be ongoing during germination, but that the direction of the mixture effect is affected by complex interactions with abiotic and biotic factors.

The degree of background matching correlates with estimates of harvest pressure, with plants being more cryptic in heavily collected populations. In a human search experiment, the time it took participants to find plants was greatly influenced by target concealment. These results point to humans as driving the evolution of camouflage in populations of this species through commercial harvesting, changing the phenotype of wild plants in an unexpected and dramatic way. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.; Color in nature is crucial for survival and reproduction.

	abstract = {Background: Biological invasion is one of the main threats to tropical biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Prosopis juliflora (Sw) DC. (Fabales: Fabaceae: Caesalpinioideae) was introduced in the Caatinga dry forest of Northeast Brazil at early 1940s and successfully spread across the region. As other invasive species, it may benefit from the soils and seed dispersal by livestock. Here we examine how seed dispersal ecology and soil conditions collectively affect seed germination, early seedling performance and consequently the P. juliflora invasive potential. Methods: Seed germination, early seedling survival, life expectancy and soil attributes were examined in 10 plots located across three habitats (flooding plain, alluvial terrace and plateau) into a human-modified landscape of the Caatinga dry forest (a total of 12,000 seeds). Seeds were exposed to four seed dispersal methods: deposition on the soil surface, burial in the soil, passed through cattle (Boss taurus) digestive tracts and mixed with cattle manure and passed through mule (Equus africanus asinus × Equus ferus caballus) digestive tracts and mixed with mule manure. Seeds and seedlings were monitored through a year and their performance examined with expectancy tables. Results: Soils differed among habitats, particularly its nutrient availability, texture and water with finely-textured and more fertile soils in the flooding plain. Total seed germination was relatively low (14.5%), with the highest score among seeds buried in the flooding plain (47.4 ± 25.3%). Seed dispersal by cattle and mule also positively impacted seed germination. Early seedling survival rate of P. juliflora was dramatically reduced with few seedlings still alive elapsed a year. Survival rate was highest in the first 30 days and declined between 30 and 60 days with stabilization at 70 days after germination in all seed treatments and habitats. However, survival and life expectancy were higher in the flooding plain at 75 days and lower in the plateau. Prosopis juliflora seedling survival and life expectancy were higher in the case seeds were mixed with cattle manure. Synthesis: Prosopis juliflora seeds and seedlings are sensitive to water stress and habitat desiccation. Therefore, they benefit from the humid soils often present across human-disturbed flooding plains. This plant also benefits from seed deposition/dispersal by livestock in these landscapes, since cattle manure represents a nutrient-rich and humid substrate for both seeds and seedlings. The quality of the seed dispersal service varies among livestock species, but this key mutualism between exotic species is due to the arillate, hard-coated and palatable seeds. Prosopis juliflora traits allow this species to take multiple benefits from human presence and thus operating as a human commensal. Copyright 2020 Nascimento et al.},

	abstract = {Experimental models of epilepsy are useful to identify potential mechanisms of epileptogenesis, seizure gene-sis, comorbidities, and treatment efficacy. The kainic acid (KA) model is one of the most commonly used. Several modes of administration of KA exist, each producing different effects in a strain-, species-, gender-, and age-dependent manner. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the various forms of KA administration (systemic, intrahippocampal, and intranasal), as well as the histologic, electrophysiological, and behavioral outcomes in different strains and species. We attempt a personal perspective and discuss areas where work is needed. The diversity of KA models and their outcomes offers researchers a rich palette of phenotypes, which may be relevant to specific traits found in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. © 2021 Rusina et al.},

	abstract = {Background: The capacity for TMS to elicit neural activity and manipulate cortical excitability has created significant expectation regarding its use in both cognitive and clinical neuroscience. However, the absence of an ability to quantify stimulation effects, particularly outside of the motor cortex, has led clinicians and researchers to pair noninvasive brain stimulation with noninvasive neuroimaging techniques. fNIRS, as an optical and wearable neuroimaging technique, is an ideal candidate for integrated use with TMS. Together, TMS+fNIRS may offer a hybrid alternative to “blind” stimulation to assess NIBS in therapy and research. Objective: In this systematic review, the current body of research into the transient and prolonged effects of TMS on fNIRS-based cortical hemodynamic measures while at rest and during tasks are discussed. Additionally, studies investigating the relation of fNIRS to measures of cortical excitability as produced by TMS-evoked Motor-Evoked-Potential (MEP) are evaluated. The aim of this review is to outline the integrated use of TMS+fNIRS and consolidate findings related to use of fNIRS to monitor changes attributed to TMS and the relationship of fNIRS to cortical excitability itself. Methods: Key terms were searched in PubMed and Web-of-Science to identify studies investigating the use of both fNIRS and TMS. Works from Google-Scholar and referenced works in identified papers were also assessed for relevance. All published experimental studies using both fNIRS and TMS techniques in the study methodology were included. Results: A combined literature search of neuroimaging and neurostimulation studies identified 53 papers detailing the joint use of fNIRS and TMS. 22/53 investigated the immediate effects of TMS at rest in the DLPFC and M1 as measured by fNIRS. 21/22 studies reported a significant effect in [HbO] for 40/54 stimulation conditions with 14 resulting an increase and 26 in a decrease. While 15/22 studies also reported [HbR], only 5/37 conditions were significant. Task effects of fNIRS+TMS were detailed in 16 studies, including 10 with clinical populations. Most studies only reported significant changes in [HbO] related measures. Studies comparing fNIRS to changes in MEP-measured cortical excitability suggest that fNIRS measures may be spatially more diffuse but share similar traits. Conclusion: This review summarizes the progress in the development of this emerging hybrid neuroimaging & neurostimulation methodology and its applications. Despite encouraging progress and novel applications, a lack of replicated works, along with highly disparate methodological approaches, highlight the need for further controlled studies. Interpretation of current research directions, technical challenges of TMS+fNIRS, and recommendations regarding future works are discussed.

	abstract = {The human cerebral cortex is a complex structure with tightly interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks. In order to study human cortical function, we recently developed a method to generate cortical neurons from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that form both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal networks resembling the composition of the human cortex. These cultures and organoids recapitulate neuronal populations representative of the six cortical layers and a balanced excitatory and inhibitory network that is functional and homeostatically stable. To determine whether hiPSC-derived neurons can integrate and retain physiologic activities in vivo, we labeled hiPSCs with red fluorescent protein (RFP) and introduced hiPSC-derived neural progenitors to rat brains. Efficient neural induction, followed by differentiation resulted in a RFP+ neural population with traits of forebrain identity and a balanced synaptic activity composed of both excitatory neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Ten weeks after transplantation, grafted cells structurally integrated into the rat forebrain. Remarkably, these hiPSC-derived neurons were able to fire, exhibiting both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which culminates in the establishment of neuronal connectivity with the host circuitry. This study demonstrates that neural progenitors derived from hiPSCs can differentiate into functional cortical neurons and can participate in neural network activity through functional synaptic integration in vivo, thereby contributing to information processing. © 2019 Yin et al.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation are recognized as affecting the nature of biotic interactions, although we still know little about such changes for reptilian herbivores and their hindgut nematodes, in which endosymbiont interactions could range from mutualistic to commensal and parasitic. We investigated the potential cost and benefit of endosymbiont interactions between the spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca L.) and adult oxyurid nematodes (Pharyngodonidae order Oxyurida) in scrublands of southern Spain. For this, we assessed the association between richness and abundance of oxyurid species with tortoises’ growth rates and body traits (weight and carapace length) across levels of habitat loss (low, intermediate and high). Furthermore, by using an intrapopulation ecological network approach, we evaluated the structure and diversity of tortoise–oxyurid interactions by focusing on oxyurid species infesting individual tortoises with different body traits and growth rates across habitats. Overall, tortoise body traits were not related to oxyurid infestation across habitats. Oxyurid richness and abundance however, showed contrasting relationships with growth rates across levels of habitat loss. At low habitat loss, oxyurid infestation was positively associated with growth rates (suggesting a mutualistic oxyurid–tortoise relationship), but the association became negative at high habitat loss (suggesting a parasitic relationship). Furthermore, no relationship was observed when habitat loss was intermediate (suggesting a commensal relationship). The network analysis showed that the oxyurid community was not randomly assembled but significantly nested, revealing a structured pattern for all levels of habitat loss. The diversity of interactions was lowest at low habitat loss. The intermediate level, however, showed the greatest specialization, which indicates that individuals were infested by fewer oxyurids in this landscape, whereas at high habitat loss individuals were the most generalized hosts. Related to the latter, connectance was greatest at high habitat loss, reflecting a more uniform spread of interactions among oxyurid species. At an individual level, heavier and larger tortoises tended to show a greater number of oxyurid species interactions. We conclude that there is an association between habitat loss and the tortoise–oxyurid interaction. Although we cannot infer causality in their association, we hypothesize that such oxyurids could have negative, neutral and positive consequences for tortoise growth rates. Ecological network analysis can help in the understanding of the nature of such changes in tortoise–oxyurid interactions by showing how generalized or specialized such interactions are under different environmental conditions and how vulnerable endosymbiont interactions might be to further habitat loss.

	abstract = {Context. Pinus herrerae and P. luzmariae are endemic to western Mexico, where they cover an area of more than 1 million hectares. Pinus herrerae is also cultivated in field trials in South Africa and South America, because of its considerable economic importance as a source of timber and resin. Seed quality, afforestation success and desirable traits may all be influenced by the presence of hybrid trees in seed stands. Aims. We aimed to determine the degree of hybridization between P. herrerae and P. luzmariae in seed stands of each species located in the Sierra Madre Occidental, Durango, Mexico. Methods. AFLP molecular markers from samples of 171 trees across five populations were analyzed with STRUCTURE and NewHybrids software to determine the degree of introgressive hybridization. The accuracy of STRUCTURE and NewHybrids in detecting hybrids was quantified using the software Hybridlab 1.0. Morphological analysis of 131 samples from two populations of P. herrerae and two populations of P. luzmariae was also conducted by Random Forest classification. The data were compared by Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) in GenAlex 6.501. Results. Hybridization between Pinus herrerae and P. luzmariae was observed in all seed stands under study and resulted in enhancement of desirable silvicultural traits in the latter species. In P. luzmariae, only about 16% molecularly detected hybrids correspond to those identified on a morphological basis. However, the morphology of P. herrerae is not consistent with the molecularly identified hybrids from one population and is only consistent with 3.3 of those from the other population. Conclusions. This is the first report of hybrid vigour (heterosis) in Mexican pines. Information about hybridization and introgression is essential for developing effective future breeding programs, successful establishment of plantations and management of natural forest stands. Understanding how natural hybridization may influence the evolution and adaptation of pines to climate change is a cornerstone to sustainable forest management including adaptive silviculture. © Copyright 2020 Wehenkel et al.},

	abstract = {Understanding how natural populations will respond to rapid anthropogenic climate change is one of the greatest challenges for ecologists and evolutionary biologists. Much research has focussed on whether physiological traits can evolve quickly enough under rapidly increasing temperatures. While the simple Breeder's equation helps to understand how extreme temperatures and genetic variation might drive within-population evolution under climate change, it does not consider two key areas: how different forms of phenotypic plasticity interact and variation among populations. Plasticity can modify the exposure to climatic extremes and the strength of selection from those extremes, while differences among populations provide adaptive diversity not apparent within them. Here, we focus on terrestrial vertebrates and, with a case study on a tropical lizard, demonstrate the complex interplay between spatial, genetic and plastic contributions to variation in climate-relevant physiological traits. We identify several problems that need to be better understood: which traits are under selection in a changing climate; the different forms of plasticity relevant to population persistence and rapid evolution; plastic versus genetic contributions to geographic variation in climate-associated traits and whether plasticity can be harnessed to promote persistence of species. Given ongoing uncertainties around whether natural populations can evolve rapidly enough to persist, we advocate the use of field trials aimed at increasing rates of adaptation, especially in systems known to be strongly impacted by human-driven changes in climate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd; Catullo and colleagues discuss the complexities of how terrestrial animals might evolve and adapt under rapidly changing climate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Populations of vertebrate species introduced onto islands regularly develop similar phenotypic changes, e.g., larger or smaller body size, shortened limbs, duller coats, as well as behavioural changes such as increased tameness and reduced flight-initiation distance. These changes overlap in part with those associated with the ‘domestication syndrome’, especially tameness and changes in coat patterns, and might indicate a similar neural crest involvement in the concurrent development of multiple phenotypic traits. Here I examine long-term data on free-living populations of wild Polynesian rats from seven mainland countries and 117 islands (n = 3,034), covering the species’ native and introduced range. Mainland populations showed no aberrant coat patterns, with the exception of one albino, whereas aberrant coat patterns were found in 12 island populations. Observed coat colour polymorphisms consisted of leucistic (including singular white patches), melanistic (darkly pigmented) and piebald (mixed) coat patterns. After isolation for at least seven centuries, wild Polynesian rat populations on islands seem to exhibit a trend towards a higher incidence of aberrant coat patterns. These phenotypic changes are here explained as a neutral, non-adaptive process, likely part of the ‘domestication syndrome’ (via the commensal pathway of domestication), in combination with genetic drift, little or no gene flow between the islands and/or the mainland and a relaxed selection (as a result of the weakening or removal of competitor/predator pressure) under commensality.

	abstract = {Developing a thorough understanding of how ectotherm physiology adapts to different thermal environments is of crucial importance, especially in the face of global climate change. A key aspect of an organism’s thermal performance curve (TPC)—the relationship between fitness-related trait performance and temperature—is its thermal sensitivity, i.e., the rate at which trait values increase with temperature within its typically experienced thermal range. For a given trait, the distribution of thermal sensitivities across species, often quantified as “activation energy” values, is typically right-skewed. Currently, the mechanisms that generate this distribution are unclear, with considerable debate about the role of thermodynamic constraints versus adaptive evolution. Here, using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we study the evolution of the thermal sensitivity of population growth rate across phytoplankton (Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) and prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), 2 microbial groups that play a major role in the global carbon cycle. We find that thermal sensitivity across these groups is moderately phylogenetically heritable, and that its distribution is shaped by repeated evolutionary convergence throughout its parameter space. More precisely, we detect bursts of adaptive evolution in thermal sensitivity, increasing the amount of overlap among its distributions in different clades. We obtain qualitatively similar results from evolutionary analyses of the thermal sensitivities of 2 physiological rates underlying growth rate: net photosynthesis and respiration of plants. Furthermore, we find that these episodes of evolutionary convergence are consistent with 2 opposing forces: decrease in thermal sensitivity due to environmental fluctuations and increase due to adaptation to stable environments. Overall, our results indicate that adaptation can lead to large and relatively rapid shifts in thermal sensitivity, especially in microbes for which rapid evolution can occur at short timescales. Thus, more attention needs to be paid to elucidating the implications of rapid evolution in organismal thermal sensitivity for ecosystem functioning. © 2020 Kontopoulos et al.

	abstract = {One of the best ex situ conservation strategies for wild germplasm is in vitro conservation of genetic banks. The success of in vitro conservation relies heavily on the micropropagation or performance of the species of interest. In the context of global change, crop production challenges and climate change, we face a reality of intensified crop production strategies, including genetic engineering, which can negatively impact biodiversity conservation. However, the possible consequences of transgene presence for the in vitro performance of populations and its implications for biodiversity conservation are poorly documented. In this study we analyzed experimental evidence of the potential effects of transgene presence on the in vitro performance of Gossypium hirsutum L. populations, representing the Mexican genetic diversity of the species, and reflect on the implications of such presence for ex situ genetic conservation of the natural variation of the species. We followed an experimental in vitro performance approach, in which we included individuals from different wild cotton populations as well as individuals from domesticated populations, in order to differentiate the effects of domestication traits dragged into the wild germplasm pool via gene flow from the effects of transgene presence. We evaluated the in vitro performance of five traits related to plant establishment (N D300): propagation rate, leaf production rate, height increase rate, microbial growth and root development. Then we conducted statistical tests (PERMANOVA, Wilcoxon post-hoc tests, and NMDS multivariate analyses) to evaluate the differences in the in vitro performance of the studied populations. Although direct causality of the transgenes to observed phenotypes requires strict control of genotypes, the overall results suggest detrimental consequences for the in vitro culture performance of wild cotton populations in the presence of transgenes. This provides experimental, statistically sound evidence to support the implementation of transgene screening of plants to reduce time and economic costs in in vitro establishment, thus contributing to the overarching goal of germplasm conservation for future adaptation.

	abstract = {Dung beetle introduction programmes were designed to accelerate exotic livestock dung degradation and to control dung breeding pestiferous flies and livestock parasites. The introduction programmes provided exotic dung beetle species with an opportunity to cross natural barriers and spread beyond their native range. There are no reports that explain what probable adaptation mechanisms enable particular dung beetle species to be the most successful invader. Here we identify the morphological, biological, physiological, ecological and behavioural attributes of the four most widespread and successful dung beetle species in introduced areas on a global scale in relation to the assumption that these species are different from other exotic and native dung beetles. We have recognised Digitonthophagus gazella (Fabricius), Onthophagus taurus (Schreber), Euoniticellus intermedius (Reiche) and Aphodius fimetarius (Linnaeus) as the most successful invaders based on their spread, predominance, distribution range and the reports of invasion. Each of these four species has different natural history traits that increase their fitness making them successful invaders. D. gazella has high fecundity and spreading ability, can instantly locate and colonise fresh and nutritious dung, and has a broad thermal window. O. taurus has morphological plasticity, high fecundity, high brood survival rate due to bi-parenting, and is adapted to extreme thermal and moisture conditions. E. intermedius has remnant-dung feeding abilities, a wide thermal window, functioning best at upper-temperature levels, and successful breeding and survival abilities at extremely low soil moisture conditions. A. fimetarius is small-sized, has high breeding and dispersal abilities, and is adapted to lower thermal and upper moisture extremes and variable soil conditions. Discussed here are perspectives on adaptive attributes of dung beetle species that are important to consider during their selection for redistributions. We have elaborated on the fitness and success characteristics of the four species individually. Further, we recommend a prior-introduction baseline monitoring of native dung beetle assemblages so as to evaluate the future impact of exotic dung beetle introductions on the recipient ecosystem.

	abstract = {Understanding the genetic basis of natural phenotypic variation is of great importance, particularly since selection can act on this variation to cause evolution. We examined expression and allelic variation in candidate flowering time loci in Brassica rapa plants derived from a natural population and showing a broad range in the timing of first flowering. The loci of interest were orthologs of the Arabidopsis genes FLC and SOC1 (BrFLC and BrSOC1, respectively), which in Arabidopsis play a central role in the flowering time regulatory network, with FLC repressing and SOC1 promoting flowering. In B. rapa, there are four copies of FLC and three of SOC1. Plants were grown in controlled conditions in the lab. Comparisons were made between plants that flowered the earliest and latest, with the difference in average flowering time between these groups ~30 days. As expected, we found that total expression of BrSOC1 paralogs was significantly greater in early than in late flowering plants. Paralog-specific primers showed that expression was greater in early flowering plants in the BrSOC1 paralogs Br004928, Br00393 and Br009324, although the difference was not significant in Br009324. Thus expression of at least 2 of the 3 BrSOC1 orthologs is consistent with their predicted role in flowering time in this natural population. Sequences of the promoter regions of the BrSOC1 orthologs were variable, but there was no association between allelic variation at these loci and flowering time variation. For the BrFLC orthologs, expression varied over time, but did not differ between the early and late flowering plants. The coding regions, promoter regions and introns of these genes were generally invariant. Thus the BrFLC orthologs do not appear to influence flowering time in this population. Overall, the results suggest that even for a trait like flowering time that is controlled by a very well described genetic regulatory network, understanding the underlying genetic basis of natural variation in such a quantitative trait is challenging. © 2015 Franks et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Meningitis is a major cause of mortality in tuberculosis (TB). It is not clear what factors promote central nervous system invasion and pathology but it has been reported that certain strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) might have genetic traits associated with neurotropism. Methods: In this study, we generated whole genome sequences of eight clinical strains of Mtb that were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients presenting with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) in Malaysia, and compared them to the genomes of H37Rv and other respiratory Mtb genomes either downloaded from public databases or extracted from local sputum isolates. We aimed to find genomic features that might be distinctly different between CSF-derived and respiratory Mtb. Results: Genome-wide comparisons revealed rearrangements (translocations, inversions, insertions and deletions) and non-synonymous SNPs in our CSF-derived strains that were not observed in the respiratory Mtb genomes used for comparison. These rearranged segments were rich in genes for PE (proline-glutamate)/PPE (proline-proline-glutamate), transcriptional and membrane proteins. Similarly, most of the ns SNPs common in CSF strains were noted in genes encoding PE/PPE proteins. Protein globularity differences were observed among mycobacteria from CSF and respiratory sources and in proteins previously reported to be associated with TB meningitis. Transcription factors and other transcription regulators featured prominently in these proteins. Homologs of proteins associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis and Neisseria meningitidis virulence were identified in neuropathogenic as well as respiratory mycobacterial spp. examined in this study. Discussion: The occurrence of in silico genetic differences in CSF-derived but not respiratory Mtb suggests their possible involvement in the pathogenesis of TBM. However, overall findings in this comparative analysis support the postulation that TB meningeal infection is more likely to be related to the expression of multiple virulence factors on interaction with host defences than to CNS tropism associated with specific genetic traits. © 2016 Saw et al.},

	abstract = {Sexual conflict drives both inter- and intrasexual dimorphisms in many diving beetles, where male persistence and female resistance traits co-evolve in an antagonistic manner. To date most studies have focussed on species where rough and smooth females and their associated males typically co-occur within populations, where phenotype matching between morphs may maintain forms as stable polymorphisms. The Palaearctic diving beetle Hydroporus memnonius is characterised by having dimorphic (rough var. castaneus and smooth, shining) females and associated males which differ in persistence traits; the two forms being largely distributed parapatrically. In this species, instead of mating trade-offs between morphs, males associated with castaneus females should have a mating advantage with both this form and shining females, due to their increased persistence abilities on either cuticular surface. This may be expected to lead to the replacement of the shining form with castaneus in areas where the two come into contact. Using data collected over a thirty year period, we show that this process of population replacement is indeed occurring, castaneus having expanded significantly at the expense of the shining female form. Whilst populations of both forms close to the contact zone appear to differ in their thermal physiology, these differences are minor and suggest that the expansion of castaneus is not linked to climatic warming in recent decades. Instead we argue that the observed spread of castaneus and its associated male may result from the dynamics of sexually antagonistic coevolution in this beetle. © 2016 Bilton and Foster.},

	abstract = {Bacterial virulence is a multifaceted trait where the interactions between pathogen and host factors affect the severity and outcome of the infection. Toxin secretion is central to the biology of many bacterial pathogens and is widely accepted as playing a crucial role in disease pathology. To understand the relationship between toxicity and bacterial virulence in greater depth, we studied two sequenced collections of the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and found an unexpected inverse correlation between bacterial toxicity and disease severity. By applying a functional genomics approach, we identified several novel toxicity-affecting loci responsible for the wide range in toxic phenotypes observed within these collections. To understand the apparent higher propensity of low toxicity isolates to cause bacteraemia, we performed several functional assays, and our findings suggest that within-host fitness differences between high- and low-toxicity isolates in human serum is a contributing factor. As invasive infections, such as bacteraemia, limit the opportunities for onward transmission, highly toxic strains could gain an additional between-host fitness advantage, potentially contributing to the maintenance of toxicity at the population level. Our results clearly demonstrate how evolutionary trade-offs between toxicity, relative fitness, and transmissibility are critical for understanding the multifaceted nature of bacterial virulence. © 2015 Laabei et al.},

Animals are frequently under attack by biotic stress, such as bacterial and viral infections, while plants are more often subjected to abiotic stress, including high salinity, drought, and cold. In response to these diverse stresses, animals and plants initiate wide-ranging changes in gene expression by altering regulation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional activities. Recent studies have identified a number of key responsive components that promote survival of animals and plants in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Importantly, with recent developments in genome-editing technology based on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, manipulation of genetic elements to generate stress-resistant animals and plants has become both feasible and cost-effective. Herein, we review important mechanisms that govern the response of organisms to biotic and abiotic stresses with the aim of applying our understanding to the agriculture and animal husbandry industries. © 2018 Songbo Xie, Min Liu, published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {Organelle-nuclear retrograde signaling regulates gene expression, but its roles in specialized cells and integration with hormonal signaling remain enigmatic. Here we show that the SAL1-PAP (30 -phosphoadenosine 50 - phosphate) retrograde pathway interacts with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling to regulate stomatal closure and seed germination in Arabidopsis. Genetically or exogenously manipulating PAP bypasses the canonical signaling components ABA Insensitive 1 (ABI1) and Open Stomata 1 (OST1); priming an alternative pathway that restores ABA-responsive gene expression, ROS bursts, ion channel function, stomatal closure and drought tolerance in ost12. PAP also inhibits wild type and abi1-1 seed germination by enhancing ABA sensitivity. PAP-XRN signaling interacts with ABA, ROS and Ca2+; up-regulating multiple ABA signaling components, including lowly-expressed Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPKs) capable of activating the anion channel SLAC1. Thus, PAP exhibits many secondary messenger attributes and exemplifies how retrograde signals can have broader roles in hormone signaling, allowing chloroplasts to finetune physiological responses. © Pornsiriwong et al.},

Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are considered to have good engraftment potential. Therefore, more efficient and less invasive methods to obtain donor cells are required. Here, we established human BMSCs from cranial bone waste (cBMSCs) obtained following routine neurosurgical procedures.cBMSCs and cells obtained from the iliac crest (iBMSCs, standard BMSCs) showed expression of cell surface markers associated with mesenchymal stem cells and multipotency traits such as differentiation into osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. cBMSCs showed higher expression of the neural crest-associated mRNAs p75, Slug, and Snail than iBMSCs. Neurogenic induced cells from cBMSCs expressed the neural markers nestin, Pax6, neurofilament (NF)-L, and NF-M as seen with RT-PCR, and NF-M protein as seen with western blotting at higher levels than cells from iBMSCs. Immunostaining showed a significantly greater proportion of NF-M-positive cells in the population of induced cBMSCs compared with the population of iBMSCs. Thus, cBMSCs showed a greater tendency to differentiate into neuron-like cells than iBMSCs. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

	abstract = {Gaze following is widespread among animals. However, the corresponding ultimate functions may vary substantially. Thus, it is important to study previously understudied (or less studied) species to develop a better understanding of the ecological contexts that foster certain cognitive traits. Penguins (Family Spheniscidae), despite their wide interspecies ecological variation, have previously not been considered for cross-species comparisons. Penguin behaviour and communication have been investigated over the last decades, but less is known on how groups are structured, social hierarchies are established, and coordination for hunting and predator avoidance may occur. In this article, we investigated how African penguins (Spheniscus demersus) respond to gaze cues of conspeciﬁcs using a naturalistic setup in a zoo environment. Our results provide evidence that members of the family Spheniscidae follow gaze of conspeciﬁcs into distant space. However, further tests are necessary to examine if the observed behaviour serves solely one speciﬁc function (e.g. predator detection) or is displayed in a broader context (e.g. eavesdropping on relevant stimuli in the environment). In addition, our ﬁndings can serve as a starting point for future cross-species comparisons with other members of the penguin family, to further explore the role of aerial predation and social structure on gaze following in social species. Overall, we also suggest that zoo-housed animals represent an ideal opportunity to extend species range and to test phylogenetic families that have not been in the focus of animal cognitive research. © 2017 Nawroth et al.},

Here, we demonstrate how short-range endemic (SRE) traits may make such taxa vulnerable to ecological and landscape traps. Three SRE species of mygalomorph spider were used in this study: Idiommata blackwalli, Idiosoma sigillatum and an undescribed Aganippe sp. Mygalomorphs can be long-lived (> 43 years) and select sites for permanent burrows in their early dispersal phase. Spiderlings from two species, I. blackwalli (n = 20) and Aganippe sp. (n = 50), demonstrated choice for microhabitats under experimental conditions, that correspond to where adults typically occur in situ. An invasive veldt grass microhabitat was selected almost exclusively by spiderlings of I. sigillatum. At present, habitat dominated by veldt grass in Perth, Western Australia, has lower prey diversity and abundance than undisturbed habitats and therefore may act as an ecological trap for this species. Furthermore, as a homogenising force, veldt grass can spread to form a landscape trap in naturally heterogeneous ecosystems. Selection of specialised microhabitats of SREs may explain high extinction rates in old, stable landscapes undergoing (human-induced) rapid change. © 2018 Mason et al.},

	abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are obligate genetic parasites that propagate in host genomes by replicating in germline nuclei, thereby ensuring transmission to offspring. This selfish replication not only produces deleterious mutations—in extreme cases, TE mobilization induces genotoxic stress that prohibits the production of viable gametes. Host genomes could reduce these fitness effects in two ways: resistance and tolerance. Resistance to TE propagation is enacted by germline-specific small-RNA-mediated silencing pathways, such as the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway, and is studied extensively. However, it remains entirely unknown whether host genomes may also evolve tolerance by desensitizing gametogenesis to the harmful effects of TEs. In part, the absence of research on tolerance reflects a lack of opportunity, as small-RNA-mediated silencing evolves rapidly after a new TE invades, thereby masking existing variation in tolerance. We have exploited the recent historical invasion of the Drosophila melanogaster genome by P-element DNA transposons in order to study tolerance of TE activity. In the absence of piRNA-mediated silencing, the genotoxic stress imposed by P-elements disrupts oogenesis and, in extreme cases, leads to atrophied ovaries that completely lack germline cells. By performing quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping on a panel of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) that lack piRNA-mediated silencing of P-elements, we uncovered multiple QTL that are associated with differences in tolerance of oogenesis to P-element transposition. We localized the most significant QTL to a small 230-kb euchromatic region, with the logarithm of the odds (LOD) peak occurring in the bruno locus, which codes for a critical and well-studied developmental regulator of oogenesis. Genetic, cytological, and expression analyses suggest that bruno dosage modulates germline stem cell (GSC) loss in the presence of P-element activity. Our observations reveal segregating variation in TE tolerance for the first time, and implicate gametogenic regulators as a source of tolerant variants in natural populations. © 2018 Kelleher et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder is a complex trait with a high degree of heritability as well as documented susceptibility from environmental factors. In this study the contributions of copy number variation, exposure to air pollutants, and the interaction between the two on autism risk, were evaluated in the population-based case-control Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment (CHARGE) Study. For the current investigation, we included only those CHARGE children (a) who met criteria for autism or typical development and (b) for whom our team had conducted both genetic evaluation of copy number burden and determination of environmental air pollution exposures based on mapping addresses from the pregnancy and early childhood. This sample consisted of 158 cases of children with autism and 147 controls with typical development. Multiple logistic regression models were fit with and without environmental variable-copy number burden interactions. We found no correlation between average air pollution exposure from conception to age 2 years and the child's CNV burden. We found a significant interaction in which a 1SD increase in duplication burden combined with a 1SD increase in ozone exposure was associated with an elevated autism risk (OR 3.4, P < 0.005) much greater than the increased risks associated with either genomic duplication (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.25–2.73) or ozone (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.93–1.54) alone. Similar results were obtained when CNV and ozone were dichotomized to compare those in the top quartile relative to those having a smaller CNV burden and lower exposure to ozone, and when exposures were assessed separately for pregnancy, the first year of life, and the second year of life. No interactions were observed for other air pollutants, even those that demonstrated main effects; ozone tends to be negatively correlated with the other pollutants examined. While earlier work has demonstrated interactions between the presence of a pathogenic CNV and an environmental exposure [Webb et al., 2016], these findings appear to be the first indication that global copy number variation may increase susceptibility to certain environmental factors, and underscore the need to consider both genomics and environmental exposures as well as the mechanisms by which each may amplify the risks for autism associated with the other.

	abstract = {Background. Invasive species are among the most significant threats to biodiversity. The diet of invasive animal populations is a crucial factor that must be considered in the context of biological invasions. A broad dietary spectrum is a frequently cited characteristic of invasive species, allowing them to thrive in a wide range of environments. Therefore, empirical studies comparing diet in invasive and native populations are necessary to understand dietary requirements, dietary flexibility, and the associated impacts of invasive species. Methods. In this study, we compared the diet of populations of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis in its native range, with several areas where it has become invasive. Each prey category detected in stomach contents was assigned to an ecological category, allowing a comparison of the diversity of ecological traits among the prey items in the diet of native and introduced populations. The comparison of diets was also performed using evenness as a niche breadth index on all sampled populations, and electivity as a prey selection index for three out of the six sampled populations. Results. Our results showed that diet breadth could be either narrow or broad in invasive populations. According to diet and prey availability, zooplankton was strongly preferred in most cases. In lotic environments, zooplankton was replaced by benthic preys, such as ephemeropteran larvae. Discussion. The relative proportions of prey with different ecological traits, and dietary variability within and between areas of occurrence, suggest that X. laevis is a generalist predator in both native and invasive populations. Shifts in the realized trophic niche are observed, and appear related to resource availability. Xenopus laevis may strongly impact aquatic ecosystems because of its near complete aquatic lifestyle and its significant consumption of key taxa for the trophic relationships in ponds. © 2017 Courant et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Nest selection is widely regarded as a key process determining the fitness of individuals and viability of animal populations. For marine turtles that nest on beaches, this is particularly pivotal as the nesting environment can significantly control reproductive success. The aim of this study was to identify the environmental attributes of beaches (i.e., morphology, vegetation, urbanisation) that may be associated with successful oviposition in green and loggerhead turtle nests. Methods. We quantified the proximity of turtle nests (and surrounding beach locations) to urban areas, measured their exposure to artificial light, and used ultra- high resolution (cm-scale) digital surface models derived from Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms, to characterise geomorphic and vegetation features of beaches on the Sunshine Coast, eastern Australia. Results. At small spatial scales (i.e., <100 m), we found no evidence that turtles selected nest sites based on a particular suite of environmental attributes (i.e., the attributes of nest sites were not consistently different from those of surrounding beach locations). Nest sites were, however, typically characterised by occurring close to vegetation, on parts of the shore where the beach- and dune-face was concave and not highly rugged, and in areas with moderate exposure to artificial light. Conclusion. This study used a novel empirical approach to identify the attributes of turtle nest sites from a broader `envelope' of environmental nest traits, and is the first step towards optimizing conservation actions to mitigate, at the local scale, present and emerging human impacts on turtle nesting beaches. © 2017 Kelly et al.},

	abstract = {Schwann cell dedifferentiation from a myelinating to a progenitor-like cell underlies the remarkable ability of peripheral nerves to regenerate following injury. However, the molecular identity of the differentiated and dedifferentiated states in vivo has been elusive. Here, we profiled Schwann cells acutely purified from intact nerves and from the wound and distal regions of severed nerves. Our analysis reveals novel facets of the dedifferentiation response, including acquisition of mesenchymal traits and a Myc module. Furthermore, wound and distal dedifferentiated Schwann cells constitute different populations, with wound cells displaying increased mesenchymal character induced by localized TGFβ signaling. TGFβ promotes invasion and crosstalks with Eph signaling via N-cadherin to drive collective migration of the Schwann cells across the wound. Consistently, Tgfbr2 deletion in Schwann cells resulted in misdirected and delayed reinnervation. Thus, the wound microenvironment is a key determinant of Schwann cell identity, and it promotes nerve repair through integration of multiple concerted signals. Video Abstract Clements et al. show that the nerve-injury-induced Schwann cell dedifferentiation program is modulated by the wound microenvironment through TGFβ. TGFβ promotes regeneration by reprogramming Schwann cells to invasive, mesenchymal-like cells and crosstalking with Eph signaling to drive collective migration. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background. Providing the context for the evolution of life-history traits, habitat features constrain successful ecological and physiological strategies. In vertebrates, a key response to life's challenges is the activation of the Stress (HPA) and Gonadal (HPG) axes. Much of the interest in stress ecology is motivated by the desire to understand the physiological mechanisms in which the environment affects fitness. As reported in the literature, several intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect variability in hormone levels. In both social and non-social animals, the frequency and type of interaction with conspecifics, as well as the status in social species, can affect HPA axis activity, resulting in changes in the reproductive success of animals. We predicted that a social environment can affect both guanaco axes by increasing the secretion of testosterone (T) and Glucocorticoid (GCs) in response to individual social interactions and the energetic demands of breeding. Assuming that prolonged elevated levels of GCs over time can be harmful to individuals, it is predicted that the HPA axis suppresses the HPG axis and causes T levels to decrease, as GCs increase. Methods. All of the data for individuals were collected by non-invasive methods (fecal samples) to address hormonal activities. This is a novel approach in physiological ecology because feces are easily obtained through non-invasive sampling in animal populations. Results. As expected, there was a marked adrenal (p-value =.3.4e-12) and gonadal (p-value = 0.002656) response due to seasonal variation in Lama guanicoe. No significant differences were found in fecal GCs metabolites between males/females*season for the entire study period (p-value = 0.2839). Despite the seasonal activity variation in the hormonal profiles, our results show a positive correlation (p-value = 1.952e-11, COR = 0.50) between the adrenal and gonadal system. The marked endocrine (r2 = 0.806) and gonad (r2 = 0.7231) response due to seasonal variation in male guanaco individuals highlights the individual's energetic demands according to life-history strategies. This is a remarkable result because no inhibition was found between the axes as theory suggests. Finally, the dataset was used to build a reactive scope model for guanacos. Discussion. Guanacos cope with the trade-offbetween sociability and reproductive benefits and costs, by regulating their GCs and T levels on a seasonal basis, suggesting an adaptive role of both axes to different habitat pressures. The results presented here highlight the functional role of stress and gonad axes on a critical phase of a male mammal's life-the mating period-when all of the resources are at the disposal of the male and must be used to maximize the chances for reproductive success. © 2016 Ovejero Aguilar et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Establishment success of non-native species is not only influenced by environmental conditions, but also by interactions with local competitors and enemies. The magnitude of these biotic interactions is mediated by species traits that reflect competitive strength or defence mechanisms. Our aim was to investigate the importance of species traits for successful establishment of non-native species in a native community exhibiting biotic resistance in the form of competition and herbivory. Methods. We developed a trait-based, individual-based simulation model tracking the survival of non-native plants in a native community. In the model, non-native plants are characterized by high or low values of competition and defence traits. Model scenarios included variation of initial number of non-natives, intensity of competitive interaction, density of herbivores and density as well as mixture of the native community. Results. Traits related to competition had a much greater impact on survival of non-native species than traits related to defence. Survival rates of strong competitors never fell below 50% while survival of weak competitors averaged at about 10%. Weak competitors were also much more susceptible to competitive pressures such as community density, composition and competition intensity. Strong competitors responded negatively to changes in competition intensity, but hardly to composition or density of the native community. High initial numbers of non-native individuals decreased survival rate of strong competitors, but increased the survival rate of weak competitors. Survival under herbivore attack was only slightly higher for plants with high defensive ability than for those with low defensive ability. Surprisingly, though, herbivory increased survival of species classified as weak competitors. Discussion. High survival rates of strong non-native competitors relate to a higher probability of successful establishment than for weak competitors. However, the reduced survival of strong competitors at high initial numbers indicates a self-thinning effect, probably mediated by a strongly competitive milieu. For weak competitors, our model emphasizes positive effects of high propagule pressure known from field studies. General effects of herbivory or defence abilities on survival were not supported by our model. However, the positive effect of herbivory on survival of weak competitors indicated side effects of herbivory, such as weakening resident competitors. This might play an important role for establishment of non-natives in a new community. © 2018 Radny and Meyer.},

	abstract = {The increase in temperature as consequence of the recent global warming has been reported to generate new ice-free areas in the Antarctic continent, facilitating the colonization and spread of plant populations. Consequently, Antarctic vascular plants have been observed extending their southern distribution. But as the environmental conditions toward southern localities become progressively more departed from the species' physiological optimum, the ecophysiological responses and survival to the expected global warming could be reduced. However, if processes of local adaptation are the main cause of the observed southern expansion, those populations could appear constrained to respond positively to the expected global warming. Using individuals from the southern tip of South America, the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula, we assess with a long term experiment (three years) under controlled conditions if the responsiveness of Colobanthus quitensis populations to the expected global warming, is related with their different foliar traits and photoprotective mechanisms along the latitudinal gradient. In addition, we tested if the release of the stress condition by the global warming in these cold environments increases the ecophysiological performance. For this, we describe the latitudinal pattern of net photosynthetic capacity, biomass accumulation, and number of flowers under current and future temperatures respective to each site of origin after three growing seasons. Overall, was found a clinal trend was found in the foliar traits and photoprotective mechanisms in the evaluated C. quitensis populations. On the other hand, an asymmetric response to warming was observed for southern populations in all ecophysiological traits evaluated, suggesting that low temperature is limiting the performance of C. quitensis populations. Our results suggest that under a global warming scenario, plant populations that inhabiting cold zones at high latitudes could increase in their ecophysiological performance, enhancing the size of populations or their spread. © 2017 Acuña-Rodríguez et al.},

These microscopic living bodies are responsible for the flow of nutrients in biogeochemical cycles and fertility imparted to the soil. Release of excessive chromium in agricultural soils due to rapid growth of industries may result in minimizing the fertility of soil in future, which will lead to reduction in crop production. Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) are beneficial to the environment, some of which can tolerate chromium and protect plants against heavy metal stress. The current study aims to identify such chromium-tolerant auxin-producing rhizobacteria and to investigate their inoculation effects on the growth characteristics of Lens culinaris in chromium polluted soils by using two different chromium salts i.e., K2Cr2O7 and K2CrO4 in varying concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 500 µgml−1). The results revealed that Bacillus species are efficient in significantly reducing the deleterious effects of Cr. These effective bacterial strains were able to stimulate the growth of metal effected plants of Lens culinaris which were grown in chromium contaminated environment. Therefore, these plant growth promoting rhizobacteria PGPRs, having both auxin production potential and chromium-resistance ability, are considered as efficient micro-factories against chromium pollution. © 2018 Fatima and Ahmed.},

	abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the expression and splicing status of genes involved in the pathogenesis or affecting the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the postmortem inferior temporal cortex samples obtained from 60 subjects with varying degree of AD-related neurofibrillary pathology. These subjects were grouped based on neurofibrillary pathology into 3 groups: Braak stages 0-II, Braak stages III-IV, and Braak stages V-VI. We also examined the right frontal cortical biopsies obtained during life from 22 patients with idiopathic shunt-responding normal pressure hydrocephalus, a disease that displays similar pathologic alterations as seen in AD. These 22 patients were categorized according to dichotomized amyloid-β positive or negative pathology in the biopsies. We observed that the expression of FRMD4A significantly decreased, and the expression of MS4A6A significantly increased in relation to increasing AD-related neurofibrillary pathology. Moreover, the expression of 2 exons in both CLU and TREM2 significantly increased with increase in AD-related neurofibrillary pathology. However, a similar trend toward increased expression in CLU and TREM2 was observed with most of the studied exons, suggesting a global change in the expression rather than altered splicing. Correlation of gene expression with well-established AD-related factors, such as α-, β-, and γ-secretase activities, brain amyloid-β42 levels, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, revealed a positive correlation between β-secretase activity and the expression of TREM2 and BIN1. In expression quantitative trait loci analysis, we did not detect significant effects of the risk alleles on gene expression or splicing. Analysis of the normal pressure hydrocephalus biopsies revealed no differences in the expression or splicing profiles of the studied genes between amyloid-β positive and negative patients. Using the protein-protein interaction-based invitro pathway analysis tools, we found that downregulation of FRMD4A associated with increased APP-β-secretase interaction, increased amyloid-β40 secretion, and altered phosphorylation of tau. Taken together, our results suggest that the expression of FRMD4A, MS4A6A, CLU, and TREM2 is altered in relation to increasing AD-related neurofibrillary pathology, and that FRMD4A may play a role in amyloidogenic and tau-related pathways in AD. Therefore, investigation of gene expression changes in the brain and effects of the identified genes on disease-associated pathways invitro may provide mechanistic insights on how alterations in these genes may contribute to AD pathogenesis. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

There is an unmet need for better methods to identify the types of vegetation that are optimal to support specific natural enemies that may colonize the crops. Here we explore the commonality of the spider assemblage-considering abundance and diversity (H)-in brassica crops with that of adjacent non-crop and non-brassica crop vegetation. We employ spatial-based multivariate ordination approaches, hierarchical clustering and spatial eigenvector analysis. The small-scale mixed cropping and high disturbance frequency of southern Chinese vegetation farming offered a setting to test the role of alternate vegetation for spider conservation. Our findings indicate that spider families differ markedly in occurrence with respect to vegetation type. Grassy field margins, non-crop vegetation, taro and sweetpotato harbour spider morphospecies and functional groups that are also present in brassica crops. In contrast, pumpkin and litchi contain spiders not found in brassicas, and so may have little benefit for conservation biological control services for brassicas. Our findings also illustrate the utility of advanced statistical approaches for identifying spatial relationships between natural enemies and the land uses most likely to offer alternative habitats for conservation biological control efforts that generates testable hypotheses for future studies. © 2017 Saqib et al.},

	abstract = {Degraded and secondary forests comprise approximately 50% of remaining tropicalforest. Bird community characteristics and population trends in secondary forestsare infrequently studied, but secondary forest may serve as a "safety net" for tropicalbiodiversity. Less understood is the occurrence of time-delayed, community-leveldynamics such as an extinction debt of specialist species or a species credit resultingfrom the recolonization of forest patches by extirpated species. We sought toelucidate patterns and magnitudes of temporal change in avian communities insecondary forest patches in Southern Costa Rica biannually over a 10 year periodduring the late breeding season and mid-winter. We classified birds caught in mistnets or recorded in point counts by residency status, and further grouped thembased on preferred habitat, sensitivity to disturbance, conservation priority, foragingguild, and foraging strata. Using hierarchical, mixed-effects models we tested fortrends among species that share traits. We found that permanent-resident speciesincreased over time relative to migrants. In both seasons, primary forest speciesgenerally increased while species typical of secondary forest, scrub, or edge declined.Species relatively sensitive to habitat disturbance increased significantly over time,whereas birds less sensitive to disturbance decreased. Similarly, generalists withhigher habitat breadth scores declined. Because, we found very few changes invegetation characteristics in secondary forest patches, shifts in the avian communitytoward primary forest species represent a species credit and are likely related tovegetation changes in the broader landscape. We suggest that natural regenerationand maturation of secondary forests should be recognized as a positive conservationdevelopment of potential benefit even to species typical of primary forest. © 2017 Latta et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Desiccation resistance shapes the distribution of terrestrial insects at multiple spatial scales. However, responses to drying stress have been poorly studied in aquatic groups, despite their potential role in constraining their distribution and diversification, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Methods. We examined desiccation resistance in adults of four congeneric water beetle species (Enochrus, family Hydrophilidae) with contrasting habitat specificity (lentic vs. lotic systems and different salinity optima from fresh- to hypersaline waters). We measured survival, recovery capacity and key traits related to desiccation resistance (fresh mass, % water content, % cuticle content and water loss rate) under controlled exposure to desiccation, and explored their variability within and between species. Results. Meso- and hypersaline species were more resistant to desiccation than freshwater and hyposaline ones, showing significantly lower water loss rates and higher water content. No clear patterns in desiccation resistance traits were observed between lotic and lentic species. Intraspecifically, water loss rate was positively related to specimens' initial % water content, but not to fresh mass or % cuticle content, suggesting that the dynamic mechanism controlling water loss is mainly regulated by the amount of body water available. Discussion. Our results support previous hypotheses suggesting that the evolution of desiccation resistance is associated with the colonization of saline habitats by aquatic beetles. The interespecific patterns observed in Enochrus also suggest that freshwater species may be more vulnerable than saline ones to drought intensification expected under climate change in semi-arid regions such as the Mediterranean Basin. © 2016 Pallarés et al.},

Here, we explore how the structure, function, and biodiversity of a planktonic metacommunity was altered after five years of experimental warming. Our outdoor mesocosm experiment was open to natural dispersal from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Warming of 4°C led to a 67% increase in the species richness of the phytoplankton, more evenly-distributed abundance, and higher rates of gross primary productivity. Warming elevated productivity indirectly, by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the local phytoplankton communities. Warming also systematically shifted the taxonomic and functional trait composition of the phytoplankton, favoring large, colonial, inedible phytoplankton taxa, suggesting stronger top-down control, mediated by zooplankton grazing played an important role. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can modulate species coexistence, and through such mechanisms, global warming could, in some cases, increase the species richness and productivity of phytoplankton communities. © 2015 Yvon-Durocher et al.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of African mole-rats of the genera Heliophobius and Fukomys (Bathyergidae) in the regions of East and south central Africa have revealed a diversity of species and vicariant populations, with patterns of distribution having been influenced by the geological process of rifting and changing patterns of drainage of major river systems. This has resulted in most of the extant members of the genus Fukomys being distributed west of the main Rift Valley. However, a small number of isolated populations are known to occur east of the African Rift Valley in Tanzania, where Heliophobius is the most common bathyergid rodent. We conducted morphological, craniometric and phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) sequences of two allopatric populations of Tanzanian mole-rats (genus Fukomys) at Ujiji and around Mount Hanang, in comparison with both geographically adjacent and more distant populations of Fukomys. Our results reveal two distinct evolutionary lineages, forming clades that constitute previously unnamed species. Here, we formally describe and designate these new species F. livingstoni and F. hanangensis respectively. Molecular clock-based estimates of divergence times, together with maximum likelihood inference of biogeographic range evolution, offers strong support for the hypothesis that vicariance in the Western Rift Valley and the drainage patterns of major river systems has subdivided populations of mole-rats. More recent climatic changes and tectonic activity in the ``Mbeya triple junction'' and Rungwe volcanic province between Lakes Rukwa and Nyasa have played a role in further isolation of these extra-limital populations of Fukomys in Tanzania. © 2017 Faulkes et al.},

Here, I explore new research that re-evaluates this theory. Recent results suggest that functional traits are malleable, enabling species to rapidly respond and adapt to each other as environmental conditions change with predictable effects on ecosystem processes. These basic research findings suggest that species adaptations may impart in ecosystems an inherent capacity to weather environmental changes, thereby offering deeper understanding about which biological attributes protect ecological functions and which are needed to restore damaged ecosystems. © 2018 Oswald J.

	abstract = {Cloud forests are one of the most endangered ecosystems in the Americas, as well as one of the richest in biological diversity in the world. The species inhabiting these forests are susceptible to environmental changes and characterized by high levels of geographic structure. The Garnet-Throated Hummingbird, Lamprolaima rhami, mainly inhabits cloud forests, but can also be found in other habitats. This species has a highly restricted distribution in Mesoamerica, and five disjunct regions have been delimited within the current geographic distribution of the species from Mexico to Honduras. According to variation in size and color, three subspecies have been described: L. r. rhami restricted to the Mexican highlands and Guatemala, L. r. occidentalis distributed in Guerrero (Mexico), and L. r. saturatior, distributed in the highlands from Honduras and El Salvador. We analyzed the levels of geographic structure in L. rhami and its taxonomic implications. We used mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to analyze genetic variation, demographic history, divergence times, reconstructed a multilocus phylogeny, and performed a species delimitation analyses. We also evaluated morphological variation in 208 specimens. We found high levels of genetic differentiation in three groups, and significant variation in morphological traits corresponding with the disjunct geographic populations. L. rhami presents population stability with the highest genetic variation explained by differences between populations. Divergence time estimates suggest that L. rhami split from its sister group around 10.55 million years ago, and the diversification of the complex was dated ca. 0.207 Mya. The hypotheses tested in the species delimitation analyses validated three independent lineages corresponding to three disjunct populations. This study provides evidence of genetic and/or morphometric differentiation between populations in the L. rhami complex where four separate evolutionary lineages are supported: (1) populations from the Sierra Madre Oriental and the highlands of Oaxaca (rhami), (2) populations from the highlands of Guerrero (occidentalis), (3) populations from the highlands of Chiapas and Guatemala (this is a non-previously proposed potential taxon: tacanensis), and (4) populations from the highlands of Honduras and El Salvador (saturatior). The main promoters of the geographic structure found in the L. rhami complex are likely the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as a geographic barrier, isolation by distance resulting from habitat fragmentation, and climatic conditions during the Pleistocene.

	abstract = {Background. Wheat is widely affected by drought. Low excised-leaf water loss (ELWL) has frequently been associated with improved grain yield under drought. This study dissected the genetic control of ELWL in wheat, associated physiological, morphological and anatomical leaf traits, and compared these with yield QTLs. Methods. Ninety-four hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) doubled haploids, mapped with over 700 markers, were tested for three years for ELWL from detached leaf 4 of glasshouse-grown plants. In one experiment, stomata per unit area and leaf thickness parameters from leaf cross-sections were measured. QTLs were identified using QTLCartographer. Results. ELWL was significantly negatively correlated with leaf length, width, area and thickness. Major QTLs for ELWL during 0-3 h and 3-6 h were coincident across trials on 3A, 3B, 4B, 5B, 5D, 6B, 7A, 7B, 7D and frequently coincident (inversely) with leaf size QTLs. Yield in other trials was sometimes associated with ELWL and leaf size phenotypically and genotypically, but more frequently under non-droughted than droughted conditions. QTL coincidence showed only ELWL to be associated with drought/control yield ratio. Discussion. Our results demonstrated that measures of ELWL and leaf size were equally effective predictors of yield, and both were more useful for selecting under favourable than stressed conditions. © 2018 Czyczyło-Mysza et al.},

	abstract = {Increased human land use has resulted in the increased homogenization of biodiversity between sites, yet we lack sufficient indicators to predict which species decline and the consequence of their potential loss on ecosystem services. We used comparative phylogenetic analysis to (1) characterize how increasing conversion of forest and grasslands to grazing pasturelands changes plant diversity and composition; (2) examine how changes in land use relate to declines in functional trait diversity; and (3) specifically investigate how these changes in plant composition affect the prevalence of zygomorphy and the possible consequences that these changes may have on pollinator functional groups. As predicted, we found that the conversion to grazing pasturelands negatively impacted species richness and phylogenetic composition. Clades with significantly more represented taxa in grasslands (GL) were genera with a high representation of agricultural weeds, while the composition was biased towards clades of subalpine herbaceous wildflowers in Mixed Forest (MF). Changes in community composition and structure had strong effects on the prevalence of zygomorphic species likely driven by nitrogen-fixing abilities of certain clades with zygomorphic flowers (e.g., Fabaceae). Land conversion can thus have unexpected impacts on trait distributions relevant for the functioning of the community in other capacities (e.g., cascading effects to other trophic levels (i.e., pollinators). Finally, the combination of traits represented by the current composition of species in GL and MF might enhance the diagnostic value of productivity and ecosystem processes in the most eroded ecosystems. © 2016 Villalobos and Vamosi.},

	abstract = {Rare hybridisations between deeply divergent animal species have been reported for decades in a wide range of taxa, but have often remained unexplained, mainly considered chance events and reported as anecdotal. Here, we combine field observations with long-term data concerning natural hybridisations, climate, land-use, and field-validated species distribution models for two deeply divergent and naturally sympatric toad species in Europe (Bufo bufo and Bufotes viridis species groups). We show that climate warming and seasonal extreme temperatures are conspiring to set the scene for these maladaptive hybridisations, by differentially affecting life-history traits of both species. Our results identify and provide evidence of an ultimate cause for such events, and reveal that the potential influence of climate change on interspecific hybridisations goes far beyond closely related species. Furthermore, climate projections suggest that the chances for these events will steadily increase in the near future. © 2017 Canestrelli et al.},

In particular, host and parasite traits such as survival and virulence may have distinct temperature dependencies that must be integrated into models of disease dynamics. Using experimental data from Daphnia magna and a microsporidian parasite, we fitted a mechanistic model of the within-host parasite population dynamics. Model parameters comprising host aging and mortality, as well as parasite growth, virulence, and equilibrium abundance, were specified by relationships arising from the metabolic theory of ecology. The model effectively predicts host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature while using less than half the parameters compared to modeling temperatures discretely. Our results serve as a proof of concept that linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host–parasite framework can be used to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. © 2018 Kirk et al.},

Yield improvement has progressed slowly, especially in drought-prone regions where annual crop production suffers from episodic aridity. Underlying drought responses are circadian and diel control of gene expression that regulate daily variations in metabolic and physiological pathways. To identify transcriptomic changes that occur in the crop Brassica rapa during initial perception of drought, we applied a co-expression network approach to associate rhythmic gene expression changes with physiological responses. Coupled analysis of transcriptome and physiological parameters over a two-day time course in control and drought-stressed plants provided temporal resolution necessary for correlation of network modules with dynamic changes in stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate, and photosystem II efficiency. This approach enabled the identification of drought-responsive genes based on their differential rhythmic expression profiles in well-watered versus droughted networks and provided new insights into the dynamic physiological changes that occur during drought. © Greenham et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Changes in climate are predicted to influence parasite and pathogen infection patterns in terrestrial and marine environments. Increases in temperature in particular may greatly alter biological processes, such as host-parasite interactions. For example, parasites could differentially benefit from increased reproduction and transmission or hosts could benefit from elevated immune responses that may mediate or even eliminate infections. In the southeastern United States, the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is infected by the lethal protozoan parasite, Perkinsus marinus. Under field conditions, intertidal (air-exposed) oysters have been found to have significantly higher P. marinus infection intensity and marginally higher infection prevalence than subtidal (submerged) oysters. During summer, air temperatures are much warmer than water and this exposure of intertidal oysters to higher temperatures is a suggested mechanism for increased infection intensity. Methods. We simulated intertidal exposure using controlled laboratory experiments to determine how host traits (survival and immune response) and parasite infection intensity will respond to elevated air temperature ranging from 27 °C to 53 °C during emersion at low tide. In Georgia, where our work was conducted, the average summer water temperature is 29 °C and the average maximum high air temperature in July is 33 °C (though oysters have been shown to survive at much higher air temperatures). Results. Host survival declined as temperature increased, with a definitive drop-offbetween 39-43 °C. Negative effects of air temperature on host immune response (phagocytic activity) were detectable only at extremely high temperatures (47-50 °C) when hosts were suffering acute mortality. Parasite infection intensity peaked at 35 °C. Discussion. Our results suggest that an increase in average summer air temperature to 35 °C or higher could affect oyster survival directly through temperature-related impacts in the short-term and indirectly through increased P. marinus infection intensity over the long-term. © 2018 Malek and Byers.},

	abstract = {Background: Adaptation to local habitat conditions may lead to the natural divergence of populations in life-history traits such as body size, time of reproduction, mate signaling or dispersal capacity. Given enough time and strong enough selection pressures, populations may experience local genetic differentiation. The genetic basis of many life-history traits, and their evolution according to different environmental conditions remain however poorly understood. Methods: We conducted an association study on the Glanville fritillary butterfly, using material from five populations along a latitudinal gradient within the Baltic Sea region, which show different degrees of habitat fragmentation. We investigated variation in 10 principal components, cofounding in total 21 life-history traits, according to two environmental types, and 33 genetic SNP markers from 15 candidate genes. Results: We found that nine SNPs from five genes showed strong trend for trait associations (p-values under 0.001 before correction). These associations, yet nonsignificant after multiple test corrections, with a total number of 1,086 tests, were consistent across the study populations. Additionally, these nine genes also showed an allele frequency difference between the populations from the northern fragmented versus the southern continuous landscape. Discussion: Our study provides further support for previously described trait associations within the Glanville fritillary butterfly species across different spatial scales. Although our results alone are inconclusive, they are concordant with previous studies that identified these associations to be related to climatic changes or habitat fragmentation within the Å land population. © 2017 Duplouy et al.},

Due to its short maturation time and life-cycle, this vertebrate model allows the study of endpoints such as maturation time and fecundity within four months. Transgenerational full life-cycle exposure trials can be performed in as little as 8 months. Since this species produces eggs that are drought-resistant and remain viable for years, the on-site culture of the species is not needed but individuals can be recruited when required.

	abstract = {Bayesian phylogenetic methods integrating simultaneously morphological and stratigraphic information have been applied increasingly among paleontologists. Most of these studies have used Bayesian methods as an alternative to the widely-used parsimony analysis, to infer macroevolutionary patterns and relationships among species-level or higher taxa. Among recently introduced Bayesian methodologies, the Fossilized Birth-Death (FBD) model allows incorporation of hypotheses on ancestordescendant relationships in phylogenetic analyses including fossil taxa. Here, the FBD model is used to infer the relationships among an ingroup formed exclusively by fossil individuals, i.e., dipnoan tooth plates from four localities in the Ain el Guettar Formation of Tunisia. Previous analyses of this sample compared the results of phylogenetic analysis using parsimony with stratigraphic methods, inferred a high diversity (five or more genera) in the Ain el Guettar Formation, and interpreted it as an artifact inflated by depositional factors. In the analysis performed here, the uncertainty on the chronostratigraphic relationships among the specimens was included among the prior settings. The results of the analysis confirm the referral of most of the specimens to the taxa Asiatoceratodus, Equinoxiodus, Lavocatodus and Neoceratodus, but reject those to Ceratodus and Ferganoceratodus. The resulting phylogeny constrained the evolution of the Tunisian sample exclusively in the Early Cretaceous, contrasting with the previous scenario inferred by the stratigraphically-calibrated topology resulting from parsimony analysis. The phylogenetic framework also suggests that (1) the sampled localities are laterally equivalent, (2) but three localities are restricted to the youngest part of the section; both results are in agreement with previous stratigraphic analyses of these localities. The FBD model of specimen-level units provides a novel tool for phylogenetic inference among fossils but also for independent tests of stratigraphic scenarios. © 2017 Cau.},

	abstract = {Invasive species are a global threat to biodiversity. Cases where the invasion has been tracked since its beginning are rare, however, such that the first interactions between invasive and native species remain poorly understood. Communication behavior is an integral part of species identity and is subject to selection. Consequently, resource use and direct interference competition between native and invasive species may drive its evolution. Here, we tested the role of interactions between the recently introduced invasive lizard Anolis cristatellus and the native Anolis oculatus on variation in behavior and communication in Calibishie (Dominica). From May to June 2016, we filmed 122 adult males of both species displaying in banana farms under two contexts (allopatry and sympatry). We then recorded (i) the proportion of time spent displaying and (ii) the relative frequency of dewlap vs. push-up displays. To control for habitat variation, we measured and compared the habitat characteristics (canopy openness and habitat openness) of 228 males in allopatry and sympatry. While the habitat characteristics and total display-time did not differ between the contexts for the two species, the proportion of display-time spent dewlapping by A. cristatellus decreased in sympatry. The display of A. oculatus did not differ between the contexts, however. Shifts in microhabitat use, predation pressure, or interspecific interference are potential factors which might explain the behavioral changes in display observed in A. cristatellus. This study highlights the role of behavioral traits as a first response of an invasive species to recent competition with a closely related native species. © 2018 Dufour et al.},

	abstract = {Variation in genotypes may be responsible for differences in dispersal rates, directional biases, and growth rates of individuals. These traits may favor certain genotypes and enhance their spatiotemporal spreading into areas occupied by the less advantageous genotypes. We study how these factors influence the speed of spreading in the case of two competing genotypes under the assumption that spatial variation of the total population is small compared to the spatial variation of the frequencies of the genotypes in the population. In that case, the dynamics of the frequency of one of the genotypes is approximately described by a generalized Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovskii–Piskunov (F–KPP) equation. This generalized F–KPP equation with (nonlinear) frequency-dependent diffusion and advection terms admits traveling wave solutions that characterize the invasion of the dominant genotype. Our existence results generalize the classical theory for traveling waves for the F–KPP with constant coefficients. Moreover, in the particular case of the quadratic (monostable) nonlinear growth–decay rate in the generalized F–KPP we study in detail the influence of the variance in diffusion and mean displacement rates of the two genotypes on the minimal wave propagation speed. © 2016, Society for Mathematical Biology.},

	abstract = {Background. Soil moisture deficiency causes yield reduction and instability in faba bean (Vicia faba L.) production. The extent of sensitivity to drought stress varies across accessions originating from diverse moisture regimes of the world. Hence, we conducted successive greenhouse experiments in pots and rhizotrons to explore diversity in root responses to soil water deficit. Methods. A set of 89 accessions from wet and dry growing regions of the world was defined according to the Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy and screened in a perlite-sand medium under well watered conditions in a greenhouse experiment. Stomatal conductance, canopy temperature, chlorophyll concentration, and root and shoot dry weights were recorded during the fifth week of growth. Eight accessions representing the range of responses were selected for further investigation. Starting five days after germination, they were subjected to a root phenotyping experiment using the automated phenotyping platform GROWSCREEN-Rhizo. The rhizotrons were filled with peat-soil under well watered and water limited conditions. Root architectural traits were recorded five, 12, and 19 days after the treatment (DAT) began. Results. In the germplasm survey, accessions from dry regions showed significantly higher values of chlorophyll concentration, shoot and root dry weights than those from wet regions. Root and shoot dry weight as well as seed weight, and chlorophyll concentration were positively correlated with each other. Accession DS70622 combined higher values of root and shoot dry weight than the rest. The experiment in GROWSCREEN-Rhizo showed large differences in root response to water deficit. The accession by treatment interactions in taproot and second order lateral root lengths were significant at 12 and 19 DAT, and the taproot length was reduced up to 57% by drought. The longest and deepest root systems under both treatment conditions were recorded by DS70622 and DS11320, and total root length of DS70622 was three times longer than that of WS99501, the shortest rooted accession. The maximum horizontal distribution of a root system and root surface coverage were positively correlated with taproot and total root lengths and root system depth. DS70622 and WS99501 combined maximum and minimum values of these traits, respectively. Thus, roots of DS70622 and DS11320, from dry regions, showed drought-avoidance characteristics whereas those of WS99501 and Mèlodie/2, from wet regions, showed the opposite. Discussion. The combination of the germplasm survey and use of GROWSCREENRhizo allowed exploring of adaptive traits and detection of root phenotypic markers for potential drought avoidance. The greater root system depth and root surface coverage, exemplified by DS70622 and DS11320, can now be tested as new sources of drought tolerance. © 2018 Belachew et al.},

	abstract = {Gene expression is a complex and quantitative trait that is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic regulators including environmental factors. Evaluating the contribu- tion of environment to gene expression regulation and identifying which genes are more likely to be influenced by environmental factors are important for understanding human complex traits. We hypothesize that by living together as couples, there can be commonly co-regulated genes that may reflect the shared living environment (e.g., diet, indoor air pollutants, behavioral lifestyle). The lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from unrelated couples of African ancestry (YRI, Yoruba people from Ibadan, Nigeria) from the International HapMap Project provided a unique model for us to characterize gene expression pattern in couples by comparing gene expression levels between husbands and wives. Strikingly, 778 genes were found to show much smaller variances in couples than random pairs of individuals at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. Since genetic variation between unrelated family members in a general population is expected to be the same assuming a random-mating society, non-genetic factors (e.g., epigenetic systems) are more likely to be the mediators for the observed transcriptional similarity in couples. We thus evaluated the contribution of modified cytosines to those genes showing transcriptional similarity in couples as well as the relationships these CpG sites with other gene regulatory elements, such as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Our findings suggested that transcriptional similarity in couples likely reflected shared common environment partially mediated through cytosine modifications. © 2016 Tang and Zhang.},

	abstract = {Camera loggers are increasingly used to examine behavioural aspects of free-ranging animals. However, often video loggers are deployed with a focus on specific behavioural traits utilizing small cameras with a limited field of view, poor light performance and video quality. Yet rapid developments in consumer electronics provide new devices with much improved visual data allowing a wider scope for studies employing this novel methodology. We developed a camera logger that records full HD video through a wide-angle lens, providing high resolution footage with a greater field of view than other camera loggers. The main goal was to assess the suitability of this type of camera for the analysis of various aspects of the foraging ecology of a marine predator, the yellow-eyed penguin in New Zealand. Frame-by-frame analysis allowed accurate timing of prey pursuits and time spent over certain seafloor types. The recorded video footage showed that prey species were associated with certain seafloor types, revealed different predator evasion strategies by benthic fishes, and highlighted varying energetic consequences for penguins pursuing certain types of prey. Other aspects that could be analysed were the timing of breathing intervals between dives and observe exhalation events during prey pursuits, a previously undescribed behaviour. Screen overlays facilitated analysis of flipper angles and beat frequencies throughout various stages of the dive cycle. Flipper movement analysis confirmed decreasing effort during descent phases as the bird gained depth, and that ascent was principally passive. Breathing episodes between dives were short (<1 s) while the majority of the time was devoted to subsurface scanning with a submerged head. Video data recorded on free-ranging animals not only provide a wealth of information recorded from a single deployment but also necessitate new approaches with regards to analysis of visual data. Here, we demonstrate the diversity of information that can be gleaned from video logger data, if devices with high video resolution and wide field of view are utilized.

We describe the new species using 3D data collected with synchrotron-based micro-CT equipment. This non-invasive technique allows for quick data collection in unusually high resolution, revealing morphological traits that are otherwise obscured by the amber. In describing this new species, we revise the diagnostic characters for Ceraphronoidea and discuss possible reasons why minute wasps with a pterostigma are often misidentified as ceraphronoids. Based on the lack of ceraphronoid characteristics, we remove Dendrocerus dubitatus Brues, 1937, Stigmaphronidae, and Radiophronidae from Ceraphronoidea and consider them as incertae sedis.

	abstract = {There is a general decline of grasslands across Europe due to habitat loss and degradation. Ensuring plant dispersal thus becomes a key process for preserving grassland patches in all scales. We examined diaspore dispersal by sheep epizoochory in the pastures of the North Adriatic Karst (NW Slovenia) and determined the qualitative and quantitative features of diaspores in fur. We recorded 25,650 diaspores of 141 plant taxa (with 107 taxa and 23,350 diaspores determined to species level), using three different methods: (i) the "whole-coat method", (ii) the "part-of-thecoat method" and (iii) a "seedling emergence method". A comparison of these techniques revealed that the "wholecoat method" provided the highest number of diaspores and plant species. All diaspores were clustered into five emergent groups based on seven functional traits (diaspore weight, length, width, height, volume, specific weight and the diaspore surface structure). Our research revealed that sheep represent an important dispersal vector, since about half of the plant species recorded in the pastures were found as diaspores in fur. This study contributes to knowledge about the modes of seed dispersal in seminatural grasslands. Taking into account that livestock play a key role in vegetation dynamics, understanding their effects on seed dispersal is essential for conservation and restoration of these species-rich grassland communities. © 2016 Mitja Kaligarič et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2016.},

	abstract = {Background. Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is a promising approach to minimize the conflicts between socio-economic activities and landscape conservation. However, its application on extensive systems of livestock production can be challenging. The main difficulties arise because animals graze on large natural pastures where they are exposed to competition with wild herbivores for heterogeneous and scarce resources, predation risk, adverse weather, and complex topography. Considering that the 91% of the world's surface devoted to livestock production is composed of extensive systems (i.e., rangelands), our general aim was to develop a PLF methodology that quantifies: (i) detailed behavioural patterns, (ii) feeding rate, and (iii) costs associated with different behaviours and landscape traits. Methods. For this, we used Merino sheep in Patagonian rangelands as a case study. We combined data from an animal-attached multi-sensor tag (tri-axial acceleration, tri-axial magnetometry, temperature sensor and Global Positioning System) with landscape layers from a Geographical Information System to acquire data. Then, we used high accuracy decision trees, dead reckoning methods and spatial data processing techniques to show how this combination of tools could be used to assess energy balance, predation risk and competition experienced by livestock through time and space. Results. The combination of methods proposed here are a useful tool to assess livestock behaviour and the different factors that influence extensive livestock production, such as topography, environmental temperature, predation risk and competition for heterogeneous resources. We were able to quantify feeding rate continuously through time and space with high accuracy and show how it could be used to estimate animal production and the intensity of grazing on the landscape. We also assessed the effects of resource heterogeneity (inferred through search times), and the potential costs associated with predation risk, competition, thermoregulation and movement on complex topography. Discussion. The quantification of feeding rate and behavioural costs provided by our approach could be used to estimate energy balance and to predict individual growth, survival and reproduction. Finally, we discussed how the information provided by this combination of methods can be used to develop wildlife-friendly strategies that also maximize animal welfare, quality and environmental sustainability. © 2018 di Virgilio et al.},

	abstract = {Sustainably managing natural resources under climate change requires understanding how species distribution shifts can impact ecosystem structure and functioning. While numerous studies have documented changes in species’ distributions and abundances in response to warming [1, 2], the consequences for the functional structure of ecosystems (i.e., composition of species’ functional traits) have received less attention. Here, using thirty years of fish monitoring, we show that two connected North Atlantic ecosystems (E. English Channel and S. North Sea) underwent a rapid shift in functional structure triggered by a climate oscillation to a prevailing warm-phase in the late-1990s. Using time-lag-based causality analyses, we found that rapid warming drove pelagic fishes with r-selected life history traits (e.g., low age and size at maturity, small offspring, low trophic level) to shift abruptly northward from one ecosystem to the other, causing an inversion in functional structure between the two connected ecosystems. While we observed only a one-year time-lag between the climate oscillation and the functional shift, indicating rapid responses to a changing environment, historical overfishing likely rendered these ecosystems susceptible to climatic stress [3], and declining fishing in the North Sea may have exacerbated the shift. This shift likely had major consequences for ecosystem functioning due to potential changes in biomass turnover, nutrient cycling, and benthic-pelagic coupling [4–6]. Under ongoing warming, climate oscillations and extreme warming events may increase in frequency and severity [7, 8], which could trigger functional shifts with profound consequences for ecosystem functioning and services. McLean et al. show that climate-induced changes in fishes’ distributions and abundances between two connected ecosystems caused inverse shifts in functional structure, primarily driven by pelagic species with rapid life histories. Future climate change could trigger similar functional shifts with profound consequences for ecosystem functioning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is currently unprecedented interest in quantifying variation in thermal physiology among organisms, especially in order to understand and predict the biological impacts of climate change. A key parameter in this quantification of thermal physiology is the performance or value of a rate, across individuals or species, at a common temperature (temperature normalisation). An increasingly popular model for fitting thermal performance curves to data-the Sharpe-Schoolfield equation-can yield strongly inflated estimates of temperature-normalised rate values. These deviations occur whenever a key thermodynamic assumption of the model is violated, i.e., when the enzyme governing the performance of the rate is not fully functional at the chosen reference temperature. Using data on 1,758 thermal performance curves across a wide range of species, we identify the conditions that exacerbate this inflation. We then demonstrate that these biases can compromise tests to detect metabolic cold adaptation, which requires comparison of fitness or rate performance of different species or genotypes at some fixed low temperature. Finally, we suggest alternative methods for obtaining unbiased estimates of temperature-normalised rate values for meta-analyses of thermal performance across species in climate change impact studies. © 2018 Kontopoulos et al.},

	abstract = {The Early to Late Oligocene Propalaeocastor is the earliest known beaver genus from Eurasia. Although many species of this genus have been described, these species are defined based on very fragmentary specimens. Propalaeocastor irtyshensis from the Early Oligocene Irtysh River Formation in northwestern Xinjiang, China is one of the earliestknown members of Propalaeocastor. This species is defined on a single maxillary fragment. We revise the diagnosis of P. irtyshensis and the genus Propalaeocastor, based on newly discovered specimens from the Irtysh River Formation. The dental morphology of P. irtyshensis is very similar to other early castorids. The caudal palatine foramen of P. irtyshensis is situated in the maxillary-palatine suture. This is a feature generally accept as diagnostic character for the castorids. On the other hand, P. irtyshensis has two upper premolars, a rudimentarily developed sciuromorph-like zygomatic plate, and a relatively large protrogomorph-like infraorbital foramen. Some previous researchers suggested that Propalaeocastor is a junior synonym of Steneofiber, while other took it as a valid genus. Our morphological comparison and phylogenetic analysis suggest that Propalaeocastor differs from Steneofiber and is a valid genus. We also suggest that Agnotocastor aubekerovi, A. coloradensis, A. galushai, A. readingi, Oligotheriomys primus, and "Steneofiber aff. dehmi" should be referred to Propalaeocastor. Propalaeocastor is the earliest and most basal beaver. The origin place of Propalaeocastor and castorids is uncertain. The Early Oligocene radiation of castorids probably is propelled by the global climate change during the Eocene-Oligocene transition. © 2017 Li et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Cloud forests, characterized by a persistent, frequent or seasonal lowlevel cloud cover and fragmented distribution, are one of the most threatened habitats, especially in the Neotropics. Tree ferns are among the most conspicuous elements in these forests, and ferns are restricted to regions in which minimum temperatures rarely drop below freezing and rainfall is high and evenly distributed around the year. Current phylogeographic data suggest that some of the cloud forest-adapted species remained in situ or expanded to the lowlands during glacial cycles and contracted allopatrically during the interglacials. Although the observed genetic signals of population size changes of cloud forest-adapted species including tree ferns correspond to predicted changes by Pleistocene climate change dynamics, the observed patterns of intraspecific lineage divergence showed temporal incongruence. Methods. Here we combined phylogenetic analyses, ancestral area reconstruction, and divergence time estimates with climatic and altitudinal data (environmental space) for phenotypic traits of tree fern species to make inferences about evolutionary processes in deep time. We used phylogenetic Bayesian inference and geographic and altitudinal distribution of tree ferns to investigate ancestral area and elevation and environmental preferences of Mesoamerican tree ferns. The phylogeny was then used to estimate divergence times and ask whether the ancestral area and elevation and environmental shifts were linked to climatic events and historical climatic preferences. Results. Bayesian trees retrieved Cyathea, Alsophyla, Gymnosphaera and Sphaeropteris in monophyletic clades. Splits for species in these genera found in Mesoamerican cloud forests are recent, from the Neogene to the Quaternary, Australia was identified as the ancestral area for the clades of these genera, except for Gymnosphaera that was Mesoamerica. Climate tolerance was not divergent from hypothesized ancestors for the most significant variables or elevation. For elevational shifts, we found repeated change from low to high elevations. Conclusions. Our data suggest that representatives of Cyatheaceae main lineages migrated from Australia to Mesoamerican cloud forests in different times and have persisted in these environmentally unstable areas but extant species diverged recentrly from their ancestors. © 2016 Sosa et al.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is one of the major anthropogenic processes contributing to local habitat loss and extirpation of numerous species, including wild bees, the most widespread pollinators. Little is known about the mechanisms through which urbanization impacts wild bee communities, or the types of urban green spaces that best promote their conservation in cities. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare wild bee community diversity, structure, and dynamics in two Canadian cities, Montreal and Quebec City. A second objective was to compare functional trait diversity among three habitat types (cemeteries, community gardens and urban parks) within each city. Bees were collected using pan traps and netting on the same 46 sites, multiple times, over the active season in 2012 and 2013. A total of 32,237 specimens were identified, representing 200 species and 6 families, including two new continental records, Hylaeus communis Nylander (1852) and Anthidium florentinum (Fabricius, 1775). Despite high community evenness, we found significant abundance of diverse species, including exotic ones. Spatio-temporal analysis showed higher stability in the most urbanized city (Montreal) but low nestedness of species assemblages among the three urban habitats in both cities. Our study demonstrates that cities are home to diverse communities of wild bees, but in turn affect bee community structure and dynamics. We also found that community gardens harbour high levels of functional trait diversity. Urban agriculture therefore contributes substantially to the provision of functionally diverse bee communities and possibly to urban pollination services. © 2017 Normandin et al.},

	abstract = {Differences in the plant's response among ecotypes or accessions are often used to identify molecular markers for the respective process. In order to analyze genetic diversity of Medicago truncatula in respect to interaction with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis, mycorrhizal colonization was evaluated in 32 lines of the nested core collection representing the genetic diversity of the SARDI collection. All studied lines and the reference line Jemalong A17 were inoculated with R. irregularis and the mycorrhization rate was determined at three time points after inoculation. There were, however, no reliable and consistent differences in mycorrhization rates among all lines. To circumvent possible overlay of potential differences by use of the highly effective inoculum, native sandy soil was used in an independent experiment. Here, significant differences in mycorrhization rates among few of the lines were detectable, but the overall high variability in the mycorrhization rate hindered clear conclusions. To narrow down the number of lines to be tested in more detail, root system architecture (RSA) of in vitro-grown seedlings of all lines under two different phosphate (Pi) supply condition was determined in terms of primary root length and number of lateral roots. Under high Pi supply (100 μM), only minor differences were observed, whereas in response to Pi-limitation (3 μM) several lines exhibited a drastically changed number of lateral roots. Five lines showing the highest alterations or deviations in RSA were selected and inoculated with R. irregularis using two different Pi-fertilization regimes with either 13 mM or 3 mM Pi. Mycorrhization rate of these lines was checked in detail by molecular markers, such as transcript levels of RiTubulin and MtPT4. Under high phosphate supply, the ecotypes L000368 and L000555 exhibited slightly increased fungal colonization and more functional arbuscules, respectively. To address the question, whether capability for mycorrhizal colonization might be correlated to general invasion by microorganisms, selected lines were checked for infection by the root rot causing pathogen, Aphanoymces euteiches. The mycorrhizal colonization phenotype, however, did not correlate with the resistance phenotype upon infection with two strains of A. euteiches as L000368 showed partial resistance and L000555 exhibited high susceptibility as determined by quantification of A. euteiches rRNA within infected roots. Although there is genetic diversity in respect to pathogen infection, genetic diversity in mycorrhizal colonization of M. truncatula is rather low and it will be rather difficult to use it as a trait to access genetic markers. © 2017 Dreher et al.},

	abstract = {Contemporary patterns of land use and global climate change are modifying regional pools of parasite host species. The impact of host community changes on human disease risk, however, is difficult to assess due to a lack of information about zoonotic parasite host assemblages. We have used a recently developed method to infer parasite-host interactions for Chagas Disease (CD) from vector-host co-occurrence networks. Vectorhost networks were constructed to analyze topological characteristics of the network and ecological traits of species' nodes, which could provide information regarding parasite regional dispersal in Mexico. Twenty-eight triatomine species (vectors) and 396 mammal species (potential hosts) were included using a data-mining approach to develop models to infer most-likely interactions. The final network contained 1,576 links which were analyzed to calculate centrality, connectivity, and modularity. The model predicted links of independently registered Trypanosoma cruzi hosts, which correlated with the degree of parasite-vector co-occurrence. Wiring patterns differed according to node location, while edge density was greater in Neotropical as compared to Nearctic regions. Vectors with greatest public health importance (i.e., Triatoma dimidiata, T. barberi, T. pallidipennis, T. longipennis, etc), did not have stronger links with particular host species, although they had a greater frequency of significant links. In contrast, hosts classified as important based on network properties were synanthropic mammals. The latter were the most common parasite hosts and are likely bridge species between these communities, thereby integrating meta-community scenarios beneficial for long-range parasite dispersal. This was particularly true for rodents, >50% of species are synanthropic and more than 20% have been identified as T. cruzi hosts. In addition to predicting potential host species using the co-occurrence networks, they reveal regions with greater expected parasite mobility. The Neotropical region, which includes the Mexican south and southeast, and the Transvolcanic belt, had greatest potential active T. cruzi dispersal, as well as greatest edge density. This information could be directly applied for stratification of transmission risk and to design and analyze human-infected vector contact intervention efficacy. © 2017 Ibarra-Cerdeña et al.},

	abstract = {Synthetic glycopolymers are instrumental and versatile tools used in various biochemical and biomedical research fields. An example of a facile and efficient synthesis of well-controlled fluorescent statistical glycopolymers using reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT)- based polymerization is demonstrated. The synthesis starts with the preparation of β-galactose-containing glycomonomer 2-lactobionamidoethyl methacrylamide obtained by reaction of lactobionolactone and N-(2-aminoethyl) methacrylamide (AEMA). 2-Gluconamidoethyl methacrylamide (GAEMA) is used as a structural analog lacking a terminal β-galactoside. The following RAFT-mediated copolymerization reaction involves three different monomers: N-(2-hydroxyethyl) acrylamide as spacer, AEMA as target for further fluorescence labeling, and the glycomonomers. Tolerant of aqueous systems, the RAFT agent used in the reaction is (4-cyanopentanoic acid)-4-dithiobenzoate. Low dispersities (≤1.32), predictable copolymer compositions, and high reproducibility of the polymerizations were observed among the products. Fluorescent polymers are obtained by modifying the glycopolymers with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester targeting the primary amine functional groups on AEMA. Lectin-binding specificities of the resulting glycopolymers are verified by testing with corresponding agarose beads coated with specific glycoepitope recognizing lectins. Because of the ease of the synthesis, the tight control of the product compositions and the good reproducibility of the reaction, this protocol can be translated towards preparation of other RAFT-based glycopolymers with specific structures and compositions, as desired. © 2015 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License.},

	abstract = {Background. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, numerous forest species are subject to severe population decline. Investigating variation in genetic diversity, phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation should be a prerequisite for implementing conservation actions. This study aimed to explore these aspects in ten fragmented populations of Physospermum cornubiense in view of translocation measures across its Italian range. Methods. For each population we collected environmental data on landscape (habitat size, quality and fragmentation) and local conditions (slope, presence of alien species, incidence of the herbivorous insect Metcalfa pruinosa and soil parameters). We measured vegetative and reproductive traits in the field and analysed the genetic population structure using ISSR markers (STRUCTURE and AMOVA). We then estimated the neutral (FST) and quantitative (PST) genetic differentiation of populations. Results. The populations exhibited moderate phenotypic variation. Population size (range: 16-655 individuals), number of flowering adults (range: 3-420 individuals) and inflorescence size (range: 5.0-8.4 cm) were positively related to Mg soil content. Populations' gene diversity was moderate (Nei-H = 0.071-0.1316); STRUCTURE analysis identified five different clusters and three main geographic groups: upper, lower, and Apennine/Western Po plain. Fragmentation did not have an influence on the local adaptation of populations, which for all measured traits showed PST < FST, indicating convergent selection. Discussion. The variation of phenotypic traits across sites was attributed to plastic response rather than local adaptation. Plant translocation from suitable source populations to endangered ones should particularly take into account provenance according to identified genetic clusters and specific soil factors. © 2018 Gentili et al.},

	abstract = {We report a case study of natural variations and correlations of some photosynthetic parameters, green biomass and grain yield in Cappelle Desprez and Plainsman V winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, which are classified as being drought sensitive and tolerant, respectively. We monitored biomass accumulation from secondary leaves in the vegetative phase and grain yield from flag leaves in the grain filling period. Interestingly, we observed higher biomass production, but lower grain yield stability in the sensitive Cappelle cultivar, as compared to the tolerant Plainsman cv. Higher biomass production in the sensitive variety was correlated with enhanced water-use efficiency. Increased cyclic electron flow around PSI was also observed in the Cappelle cv. under drought stress as shown by light intensity dependence of the ratio of maximal quantum yields of Photosystem I and Photosystem II, as well by the plot of the Photosystem I electron transport rate as a function of Photosystem II electron transport rate. Higher CO2 uptake rate in flag leaves of the drought-stressed Plainsman cv. during grain filling period correlates well with its higher grain yield and prolonged transpiration rate through spikes. The increase in drought factor (DFI) and performance (PI) indices calculated from variable chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of secondary leaves also showed correlation with higher biomass in the Cappelle cultivar during the biomass accumulation period. However, during the grain filling period, DFI and PI parameters of the flag leaves were higher in the tolerant Plainsman V cultivar and showed correlation with grain yield stability. Our results suggest that overall biomass and grain yield may respond differentially to drought stress in different wheat cultivars and therefore phenotyping for green biomass cannot be used as a general approach to predict grain yield. We also conclude that photosynthetic efficiency of flag and secondary leaves is correlated with grain yield and green biomass, respectively. In addition, secondary trait associated mechanisms like delayed senescence and higher water-use efficiency also contribute to biomass stability. Our studies further prove that photosynthetic parameters could be used to characterize environmental stress responses. © 2016 Paul et al.},

	abstract = {Drought tolerance was evaluated in twelve cultivars of three ornamental Tagetes species (T. patula, T. tenuifolia and T. erecta). A stress treatment was performed by completely stopping watering of plants maintained in controlled greenhouse conditions. After three weeks, several plant growth parameters (stem length (SL), fresh weight (FW) and water content (WC)), photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids (Car)), osmolytes (proline (Pro), glycine betaine (GB) and total soluble sugars (TSS)), an oxidative stress maker (malondialdehyde (MDA)) and antioxidants (total phenolic compounds (TPC) and total flavonoids (TF)) were measured. Considerable differences in the evaluated traits were found among the control and drought-stressed plants. Drought stress generally caused a marked reduction in plant growth and carotenoid pigments, and an increase in soluble solutes and oxidative stress. For most cultivars, proline levels in stressed plants increased between 30 and 70-fold compared to the corresponding controls. According to the different measured parameters, on average T. erecta proved to be more tolerant to drought than T. patula and T. tenuifolia. However, a considerable variation in the tolerance to drought was found within each species. The traits with greater association to drought tolerance as well as the most tolerant cultivars could be clearly identified in a principal components analysis (PCA). Overall, our results indicate that drought tolerant cultivars of Tagetes can be identified at early stages using a combination of plant growth and biochemical markers. © 2016 Cicevan et al.},

Our model predicts that thirty-five species may be able to transmit the virus, seven of which are found in the continental United States, including Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx. pipiens.

For this we used network analysis to evaluate the impact of fragmentation on howler population traits and on resource availability and food choice. A total of 37 tree and liana species and seven plant items (bark, immature fruits, flowers, mature fruits, immature leaves, mature leaves and petioles) were consumed, but their relative consumption varied according to sex and age classes and habitat type. Overall, adult females consumed the greatest number of plant species and items while infants and juveniles the lowest. For both continuous and fragmented forests, we found a nested diet for howler monkey-plant networks: diets of more selective monkeys represent subsets of the diets of other individuals. Nestedness was likely due to the high selectivity of early life stages in specific food plants and items, which contrasts with the generalized foraging behaviour of adults. Information on the extent to which different plant species and primate populations depend on such interactions in different habitats will help to make accurate predictions about the potential impact of disturbances on plant-animal interaction networks. © 2016 Benitez-Malvido et al.},

A major open question then is the potential for adaptive evolutionary change under these shifting climates. At the most basic level, evolutionary change requires the presence of heritable variation and natural selection. Because organismal tolerances of high temperature place an upper bound on responding to temperature change, there has been a surge of research effort on the evolutionary potential of upper thermal tolerance traits. Here, I review the available evidence on heritable variation in upper thermal tolerance traits, adopting a biogeographic perspective to understand how heritability of tolerance varies across space. Specifically, I use meta-analytical models to explore the relationship between upper thermal tolerance heritability and environmental variability in temperature. I also explore how variation in the methods used to obtain these thermal tolerance heritabilities influences the estimation of heritable variation in tolerance. I conclude by discussing the implications of a positive relationship between thermal tolerance heritability and environmental variability in temperature and how this might influence responses to future changes in climate. © 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.},

In this paper, wepresent a phylogenetic analysis, divergence times, and ancestral distribution ranges of the Liolaemus alticolor- bibronii group (Liolaemus sensu stricto subgenus). We inferred a total evidence phylogeny combining molecular (Cytb and 12S genes) and morphological characters using Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian Inference. Divergence times were calculated using Bayesian MCMC with an uncorrelated lognormal distributed relaxed clock, calibrated with a fossil record. Ancestral ranges were estimated using the Dispersal-Extinction- Cladogenesis (DEC-Lagrange). Effects of some a priori parameters of DEC were also tested. Distribution ranged from central Perú to southern Argentina, including areas at sea level up to the high Andes. The L. alticolor-bibronii group was recovered as monophyletic, formed by two clades: L. walkeri and L. gracilis, the latter can be split in two groups. Additionally, many species candidates were recognized. We estimate that the L. alticolor-bibronii group diversified 14.5 Myr ago, during the Middle Miocene. Our results suggest that the ancestor of the Liolaemus alticolor-bibronii group was distributed in a wide area including Patagonia and Puna highlands. The speciation pattern follows the South-North Diversification Hypothesis, following the Andean uplift. © 2018 Portelli and Quinteros.},

	abstract = {Cancer metastases arise from a multi-step process that requires metastasizing tumor cells to adapt to signaling input from varying tissue environments [1]. As an early metastatic event, cancer cell dissemination occurs through different migration programs, including multicellular, collective, and single-cell mesenchymal or amoeboid migration [2–4]. Migration modes can interconvert based on changes in cell adhesion, cytoskeletal mechanotransduction [5], and/or proteolysis [6], most likely under the control of transcriptional programs such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [7, 8]. However, how plasticity of tumor cell migration and EMT is spatiotemporally controlled and connected upon challenge by the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. Using 3D cultures of collectively invading breast and head and neck cancer spheroids, here we identify hypoxia, a hallmark of solid tumors [9], as an inducer of the collective-to-amoeboid transition (CAT), promoting the dissemination of amoeboid-moving single cells from collective invasion strands. Hypoxia-induced amoeboid detachment was driven by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), followed the downregulation of E-cadherin, and produced heterogeneous cell subsets whose phenotype and migration were dependent (∼30%) or independent (∼70%) of Twist-mediated EMT. EMT-like and EMT-independent amoeboid cell subsets showed stable amoeboid movement over hours as well as leukocyte-like traits, including rounded morphology, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-independent migration, and nuclear deformation. Cancer cells undergoing pharmacological stabilization of HIFs retained their constitutive ability for early metastatic seeding in an experimental model of lung metastasis, indicating that hypoxia-induced CAT enhances cell release rather than early organ colonization. Induced by metabolic challenge, amoeboid movement may thus constitute a common endpoint of both EMT-dependent and EMT-independent cancer dissemination programs. © 2017},

However, it is unclear how behavioral flexibility works: It relates to problem solving ability and speed in unpredictable ways, which leaves an open question of whether behavioral flexibility varies with differences in other behaviors. If present, such correlations would mask which behavior causes individuals to vary. I investigated whether behavioral flexibility (reversal learning) performances were linked with other behaviors in great-tailed grackles, an invasive bird. I found that behavioral flexibility did not significantly correlate with neophobia, exploration, risk aversion, persistence, or motor diversity. This suggests that great-tailed grackle performance in behavioral flexibility tasks reflects a distinct source of individual variation. Maintaining multiple distinct sources of individual variation, and particularly variation in behavioral flexibility, may be a mechanism for coping with the diversity of novel elements in their environments and facilitate this species' invasion success. © 2016 Logan.},

	abstract = {The cuticle layer consisting mainly of lipids and hydroxyapatite (HAp) atop the mineralized avian eggshell is a protective structure that prevents the egg from dehydration and microbial invasions. Previous ornithological studies have revealed that the cuticle layer is also involved in modulating the reflectance of eggshells in addition to pigments (protoporphyrin and biliverdin). Thus, the cuticle layer represents a crucial trait that delivers ecological signals. While present in most modern birds, direct evidence for cuticle preservation in stem birds and non-avian dinosaurs is yet missing. Here we present the first direct and chemical evidence for the preservation of the cuticle layer on dinosaur eggshells. We analyze several theropod eggshells from various localities, including oviraptorid Macroolithus yaotunensis eggshells from the Late Cretaceous deposits of Henan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong in China and alvarezsaurid Triprismatoolithus eggshell from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, United States, with the scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA), and Raman spectroscopy (RS). The elemental analysis with EPMA shows high concentration of phosphorus at the boundary between the eggshell and sediment, representing the hydroxyapatitic cuticle layer (HAp). Depletion of phosphorus in sediment excludes the allochthonous origin of the phosphorus in these eggshells. The chemometric analysis of Raman spectra collected from fossil and extant eggs provides further supportive evidence for the cuticle preservation in oviraptorid and probable alvarezsaurid eggshells. In accordance with our previous discovery of pigments preserved in Cretaceous oviraptorid dinosaur eggshells, we validate the cuticle preservation on dinosaur eggshells through deep time and offer a yet unexplored resource for chemical studies targeting the evolution of dinosaur nesting ecology. Our study also suggests that the cuticle structure can be traced far back to maniraptoran dinosaurs and enhance their reproductive success in a warm and mesic habitat such as Montana and southern China during the Late Cretaceous. © 2018 Yang et al.},

	abstract = {Behavioral flexibility is considered an important trait for adapting to environmental change, but it is unclear what it is, how it works, and whether it is a problem solving ability. I investigated behavioral flexibility and problem solving experimentally in greattailed grackles, an invasive bird species and thus a likely candidate for possessing behavioral flexibility. Grackles demonstrated behavioral flexibility in two contexts, the Aesop's Fable paradigm and a color association test. Contrary to predictions, behavioral flexibility did not correlate across contexts. Four out of 6 grackles exhibited efficient problem solving abilities, but problem solving efficiency did not appear to be directly linked with behavioral flexibility. Problem solving speed also did not significantly correlate with reversal learning scores, indicating that faster learners were not the most flexible. These results reveal how little we know about behavioral flexibility, and provide an immense opportunity for future research to explore how individuals and species can use behavior to react to changing environments. © 2016 Logan.},

	abstract = {Plants are at the trophic base of terrestrial ecosystems, and the diversity of plant species in an ecosystem is a principle determinant of community structure. This may arise from diverse functional traits among species. In fact, genetic diversity within species can have similarly large effects. However, studies of intraspecific genetic diversity have used genotypes varying in several complex traits, obscuring the specific phenotypic variation responsible for community-level effects. Using lines of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata genetically altered in specific well-characterized defense traits and planted into experimental populations in their native habitat, we investigated community-level effects of trait diversity in populations of otherwise isogenic plants. We conclude that the frequency of defense traits in a population can determine the outcomes of these traits for individuals. Furthermore, our results suggest that some ecosystem-level services afforded by genetically diverse plant populations could be recaptured in intensive monocultures engineered to be functionally diverse. © Schuman et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Functional traits are the primary biotic component driving organism influence on ecosystem functions; in consequence, traits are widely used in ecological research. However, most animal trait-based studies use easy-to-measure characteristics of species that are at best only weakly associated with functions. Animal-mediated pollination is a key ecosystem function and is likely to be influenced by pollinator traits, but to date no one has identified functional traits that are simple to measure and have good predictive power. Methods. Here, we show that a simple, easy to measure trait (hairiness) can predict pollinator effectiveness with high accuracy. We used a novel image analysis method to calculate entropy values for insect body surfaces as a measure of hairiness. We evaluated the power of our method for predicting pollinator effectiveness by regressing pollinator hairiness (entropy) against single visit pollen deposition (SVD) and pollen loads on insects. We used linear models and AICC model selection to determine which body regions were the best predictors of SVD and pollen load. Results. We found that hairiness can be used as a robust proxy of SVD. The best models for predicting SVD for the flower species Brassica rapa and Actinidia deliciosa were hairiness on the face and thorax as predictors (R2 =0.98 and 0.91 respectively). The best model for predicting pollen load for B. rapa was hairiness on the face (R2 =0.81). Discussion. We suggest that the match between pollinator body region hairiness and plant reproductive structure morphology is a powerful predictor of pollinator effectiveness. We show that pollinator hairiness is strongly linked to pollination-an important ecosystem function, and provide a rigorous and time-efficient method for measuring hairiness. Identifying and accurately measuring key traits that drive ecosystem processes is critical as global change increasingly alters ecological communities, and subsequently, ecosystem functions worldwide. © 2016 Stavert et al.},

	abstract = {Background: Inter-patch movements may lead to genetic mixing, decreasing both inbreeding and population extinction risks, and is hence a crucial aspect of amphibian meta-population dynamics. Traveling through heterogeneous landscapes might be particularly risky for amphibians. Understanding how these species perceive their environment and how they move in heterogeneous habitats is an essential step in explaining metapopulation dynamics and can be important for predicting species’ responses to climate change and for conservation policy and management. Methods: Using an experimental approach, the present study focused on the movement behavior (crossing speed and number of stops) on different substrates mimicking landscape components (human-made and natural substrates) in two amphibian species contrasting in locomotion mode: the common toad (Bufo bufo), a hopping and burrowing anuran and the marbled newt (Triturus marmoratus), a walking salamander. We tested the hypothesis that species reaction to substrate is dependent on specific ecological requirements or locomotion modes because of morphological and behavioral differences. Results: In both species, substrate type influenced individual crossing speed, with individuals moving faster on soil than on concrete substrate. We also demonstrated that long-legged individuals moved faster than individuals with short legs. In both species, the number of stops was higher in females than in males. In common toads, the number of stops did not vary between substrates tested, whereas in marbled newts the number of stops was higher on concrete than on soil substrate. Discussion: We highlighted that concrete substrate (mimicking roads) negatively affect the crossing speed of both studied species, with an effect potentially higher in marbled newts. Our findings corroborate negative effects of such heterogeneous landscapes on movement behavior of two amphibian species, which may have implications for the dynamics of metapopulations.

	abstract = {                             Tropical landscapes are changing rapidly due to changes in land use and land management. Being able to predict and monitor land use change impacts on species for conservation or food security concerns requires the use of habitat quality metrics, that are consistent, can be mapped using above-ground sensor data and are relevant for species performance. Here, we focus on ground surface temperature (Thermal                             ground                             ) and ground vegetation greenness (NDVI                             down                             ) as potentially suitable metrics of habitat quality. Both have been linked to species demography and community structure in the literature. We test whether they can be measured consistently from the ground and whether they can be up-scaled indirectly using canopy structure maps (Leaf Area Index, LAI, and Fractional vegetation cover, FCover) developed from Landsat remote sensing data. We measured Thermal                             ground                              and NDVI                             down                              across habitats differing in tree cover (natural grassland to forest edges to forests and tree plantations) in the human-modified coastal forested landscapes of Kwa-Zulua Natal, South Africa. We show that both metrics decline significantly with increasing canopy closure and leaf area, implying a potential pathway for upscaling both metrics using canopy structure maps derived using earth observation. Specifically, our findings suggest that opening forest canopies by 20% or decreasing forest canopy LAI by one unit would result in increases of Thermal                             ground                              by 1.2                              ◦                             C across the range of observations studied. NDVI                             down                              appears to decline by 0.1 in response to an increase in canopy LAI by 1 unit and declines nonlinearly with canopy closure. Accounting for micro-scale variation in temperature and resources is seen as essential to improve biodiversity impact predictions. Our study suggests that mapping ground surface temperature and ground vegetation greenness utilising remotely sensed canopy cover maps could provide a useful tool for mapping habitat quality metrics that matter to species. However, this approach will be constrained by the predictive capacity of models used to map field-derived forest canopy attributes. Furthermore, sampling efforts are needed to capture spatial and temporal variation in Thermal                             ground                              within and across days and seasons to validate the transferability of our findings. Finally, whilst our approach shows that surface temperature and ground vegetation greenness might be suitable habitat quality metric used in biodiversity monitoring, the next step requires that we map demographic traits of species of different threat status onto maps of these metrics in landscapes differing in disturbance and management histories. The derived understanding could then be exploited for targeted landscape restoration that benefits biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale.

Specifically, carbonyls cause an increase in viscosity (often referred to as 'aging') during storage of bio-oils. As such, carbonyl content has previously been used as a method of tracking bio-oil aging and condensation reactions with less variability than viscosity measurements. Additionally, carbonyls are also responsible for coke formation in bio-oil upgrading processes. Given the importance of carbonyls in bio-oils, accurate analytical methods for their quantification are very important for the bio-oil community. Potentiometric titration methods based on carbonyl oximation have long been used for the determination of carbonyl content in pyrolysis bio-oils. Here, we present a modification of the traditional carbonyl oximation procedures that results in less reaction time, smaller sample size, higher precision, and more accurate carbonyl determinations.

Our μ-CT investigations revealed that the Buresch's newt (Triturus ivanbureschi) possess a peculiar cranial construction. In addition to the typical amphibian pleurokinetic articulation between skull roof and palatoquadrate associated structures, we found flexible connections between nasals and frontals (prokinesis), vomer and parasphenoid (palatokinesis), and between frontals and parietals (mesokinesis). This is the first description of mesokinesis in urodelans. The construction of the skull in the Buresch's newts also indicates the presence of an articulation between parietals and the exocipitals, discussed as a possible kind of metakinesis. The specific combination of pleuro-, pro-, meso-, palato-, and metakinetic skull articulations indicate to a new kind of kinetic systems unknown for urodelans to this date. We discuss the possible neotenic origin of the skull kinesis and pose the hypothesis that the kinesis in T. ivanbureschi increases the efficiency of fast jaw closure. For that, we compared the construction of the skull in T. ivanbureschi to the akinetic skull of the Common fire salamander Salamandra salamandra. We hypothesize that the design of the skull in the purely terrestrial living salamander shows a similar degree of intracranial mobility. However, this mobility is permitted by elasticity of some bones and not by true articulation between them. We comment on the possible relation between the skull construction and the form of prey shaking mechanism that the species apply to immobilize their victims. © 2016 Natchev et al.},

	abstract = {Changes in the mean and variance of phenotypic traits like wing and head morphology are frequently used as indicators of environmental stress experienced during development and may serve as a convenient index of urbanization exposure. To test this claim, we collected adult western honey bee (Apis mellifera Linnaeus 1758, Hymenoptera, Apidae) workers from colonies located across an urbanization gradient, and quantified associations between the symmetries of both wing size and wing shape, and several landscape traits associated with urbanization. Landscape traits were assessed at two spatial scales (three km and 500 m) and included vegetation and anthropogenic land cover, total road length, road proximity and, population and dwelling density. We then used geometric morphometric techniques to determine two wing asymmetry scores—centroid size, a measure of wing size asymmetry and Procrustes distance, a measure of wing shape asymmetry. We found colony dependent differences in both wing size and shape asymmetry. Additionally, we found a negative association between wing shape asymmetry and road proximity at the three km buffer, and associations between wing shape asymmetry and road proximity, anthropogenic land cover and vegetation cover at the 500 m buffer. Whilst we were unable to account for additional variables that may influence asymmetry including temperature, pesticide presence, and parasitism our results demonstrate the potential usefulness of wing shape asymmetry for assessing the impact of certain landscape traits associated with urbanization.

	abstract = {Objective: The regulatory role of capsaicin-sensitive peptidergic sensory nerves has been shown in acute inflammation, but little is known about their involvement in T/B-cell driven autoimmune arthritis. This study integratively characterized the function of these nerve endings in the proteoglycan-induced chronic arthritis (PGIA), a translational model of rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: Peptidergic afferents were defunctionalized by resiniferatoxin (RTX) pretreatment in BALB/c mice, PGIA was induced by repeated antigen challenges. Hind paw volume, arthritis severity, grasping ability and the mechanonociceptive threshold were monitored during the 17-week experiment. Myeloperoxidase activity, vascular leakage and bone turnover were evaluated by in vivo optical imaging. Bone morphology was assessed using micro-CT, the intertarsal small joints were processed for histopathological analysis. Results: Following desensitization of the capsaicin-sensitive afferents, ankle edema, arthritis severity and mechanical hyperalgesia were markedly diminished. Myeloperoxidase activity was lower in the early, but increased in the late phase, whilst plasma leakage and bone turnover were not altered. Desensitized mice displayed similar bone spurs and erosions, but increased trabecular thickness of the tibia and bony ankylosis of the spine. Intertarsal cartilage thickness was not altered in the model, but desensitization increased this parameter in both the non-arthritic and arthritic groups. Conclusion: This is the first integrative in vivo functional and morphological characterization of the PGIA mouse model, wherein peptidergic afferents have an important regulatory function. Their overall effect is proinflammatory by increasing acute inflammation, immune cell activity and pain. Meanwhile, their activation decreases spinal ankylosis, arthritis-induced altered trabecularity, and cartilage thickness in small joints. © 2018 The Author(s).},

This complex multi-dimensional amalgam of inputs enables continuous adjustment of root growth rates, direction, and metabolic activity that define a dynamic physical network. Current methods for analyzing root biology balance physiological relevance with imaging capability. To bridge this divide, we developed an integratedimaging system called Growth and Luminescence Observatory for Roots (GLO-Roots) that uses luminescence-based reporters to enable studies of root architecture and gene expression patterns in soil-grown, light-shielded roots. We have developed image analysis algorithms that allow the spatial integration of soil properties, gene expression, and root system architecture traits.

	abstract = {Summary The conversion of natural habitats to farmland is a major driver of the global extinction crisis [1, 2]. Two strategies are promoted to mitigate the impacts of agricultural expansion on biodiversity: land sharing integrates wildlife-friendly habitats within farmland landscapes, and land sparing intensifies farming to allow the offset of natural reserves [3]. A key question is which strategy would protect the most phylogenetic diversity - the total evolutionary history shared across all species within a community [4]. Conserving phylogenetic diversity decreases the chance of losing unique phenotypic and ecological traits [5] and provides benefits for ecosystem function and stability [6, 7]. Focusing on birds in the threatened Chocó-Andes hotspot of endemism [8], we tested the relative benefits of each strategy for retaining phylogenetic diversity in tropical cloud forest landscapes threatened by cattle pastures. Using landscape simulations, we find that land sharing would protect lower community-level phylogenetic diversity than land sparing and that with increasing distance from forest (from 500 to >1,500 m), land sharing is increasingly inferior to land sparing. Isolation from forest also leads to the loss of more evolutionarily distinct species from communities within land-sharing landscapes, which can be avoided with effective land sparing. Land-sharing policies that promote the integration of small-scale wildlife-friendly habitats might be of limited benefit without the simultaneous protection of larger blocks of natural habitat, which is most likely to be achieved via land-sparing measures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Flowering is one of the most influential events in the life history of a plant and one of the main determinants of reproductive investment and lifetime fitness. It is also a highly complex trait controlled by dozens of genes. Understanding the selective pressures influencing time to flowering, and being able to reliably predict how it will evolve in novel environments, are unsolved challenges for plant evolutionary geneticists. Using the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, we examined the impact of simulated high and low winter precipitation levels on the flowering time of naturalized lines from across the eastern portion of the introduced North American range, and the fitness consequences of early versus late flowering. Flowering time order was significantly correlated across two environments-in a previous common garden experiment and in environmental chambers set to mimic mid-range photoperiod and temperature conditions. Plants in low water flowered earlier, had fewer basal branches and produced fewer fruits. Selection in both treatments favored earlier flowering and more basal branches. Our analyses revealed an interaction between flowering time and water treatment for fitness, where flowering later was more deleterious for fitness in the low water treatment. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in winter precipitation levels are one of the selective agents underlying a flowering time cline in introduced A. thaliana populations. © 2015 Stock et al.},

	abstract = {Over the past three decades the colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum has been expanding its global range, significantly impacting marine habitats and aquaculture facilities. What biological features make D. vexillum so highly invasive? Here, we show that juxtaposed allogeneic D. vexillum colony fragments ('ramets') may, initially, form chimeric entities. Subsequently, zooids of the differing genotypes within such chimeras coordinately retreat away from fusion zones. A few days following such post-fusion retreat movements there is further ramet fission and the formation of zooid-depauperate tunic zones. Using polymorphic microsatellite loci to distinguish between genotypes, we found that they were sectorial at the fusion zones and the subsequent ramet movements resulted in further spatial separation of the pairedgenotypes indicating that the fusion events observed did not lead to formation of long-term, stable chimeras. Thus, movements of D. vexillum colony ramets from initial fusion zones lead to progressive segregation of genotypes probably minimizing potential somatic/germ-cell competition/parasitism. We speculate that relatively fast (≤10 mm/day) movement of D. vexillum colonies on substrates along with frequent, and perhaps unrestrained, transient allogeneic fusions play significant roles in this species' striking invasiveness and capacity to colonize new substrates. © 2018 Fidler et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Assembly of species into communities following human disturbance (e.g., deforestation, fragmentation) may be governed by spatial (e.g., dispersal) or environmental (e.g., niche partitioning) mechanisms. Variation partitioning has been used to broadly disentangle spatial and environmental mechanisms, and approaches utilizing functional and phylogenetic characteristics of communities have been implemented to determine the relative importance of particular environmental (or niche-based) mechanisms. Nonetheless, few studies have integrated these quantitative approaches to comprehensively assess the relative importance of particular structuring processes. Methods. We employed a novel variation partitioning approach to evaluate the relative importance of particular spatial and environmental drivers of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic aspects of bat communities in a human-modified landscape in Costa Rica. Specifically, we estimated the amount of variation in species composition (taxonomic structure) and in two aspects of functional and phylogenetic structure (i.e., composition and dispersion) along a forest loss and fragmentation gradient that are uniquely explained by landscape characteristics (i.e., environment) or space to assess the importance of competing mechanisms. Results. The unique effects of space on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic structure were consistently small. In contrast, landscape characteristics (i.e., environment) played an appreciable role in structuring bat communities. Spatially-structured landscape characteristics explained 84% of the variation in functional or phylogenetic dispersion, and the unique effects of landscape characteristics significantly explained 14% of the variation in species composition. Furthermore, variation in bat community structure was primarily due to differences in dispersion of species within functional or phylogenetic space along the gradient, rather than due to differences in functional or phylogenetic composition. Discussion. Variation among bat communities was related to environmental mechanisms, especially niche-based (i.e., environmental) processes, rather than spatial mechanisms. High variation in functional or phylogenetic dispersion, as opposed to functional or phylogenetic composition, suggests that loss or gain of niche space is driving the progressive loss or gain of species with particular traits from communities along the human-modified gradient. Thus, environmental characteristics associated with landscape structure influence functional or phylogenetic aspects of bat communities by effectively altering the ways in which species partition niche space. ï¿½ 2016 Cisneros et al.},

	abstract = {Convergent adaptive evolution of species’ ecological niches—i.e., the appearance of similar niches in independent lineages—is the result of natural selection acting on niche-related species traits (“traits” hereafter) and contrasts with neutral evolution [1–4]. Although trait convergences are recognized as being of importance at the species scale, we still know little about the impact of species convergence on the overall trait and niche structure of entire biotas at large spatial scales [5]. Here, we map the convergent evolution of four traits (diet, body mass, activity cycle, and foraging strata) for mammal species and assemblages (defined at 200 × 200 km resolution) at a global scale. Using data on the geographic distributions, traits, and phylogenetic relationships of species and by comparing observed patterns of trait β-diversity to evolutionary neutral expectations, we show that trait convergence is not restricted to particular lineages but scales up to entire assemblages (i.e., whole species communities). We find region-wide biota convergence in traits between regions with similar climates, particularly between Australia and other continents. Pairs of assemblages that show trait divergence often involves Arctic regions where rapid evolutionary changes occurred in response to extreme climatic constraints. By integrating both macroecological and macroevolutionary approaches into a single framework, our study quantifies the crucial role of evolutionary processes such as natural selection in the spatial distribution and structure of large-scale species assemblages. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

While efforts to develop therapeutics, vaccines, and novel genetic mosquito-control technologies are underway, many important underlying ecological questions remain that could significantly enhance our understanding and ability to predict and prevent transmission. Here, we review the current knowledge about the transmission ecology of two recent arbovirus invaders, the chikungunya and Zika viruses. We introduce the viruses and mosquito vectors, highlighting viral biology, historical routes of transmission, and viral mechanisms facilitating rapid global invasion. In addition, we review factors contributing to vector global invasiveness and transmission efficiency. We conclude with a discussion of how human-induced biotic and abiotic environmental changes facilitate mosquito-borne virus transmission, emphasizing critical gaps in understanding. These knowledge gaps are tremendous; much of our data on basic mosquito ecology in the field predate 1960, and the mosquitoes themselves, as well as the world they live in, have substantially changed. A concerted investment in understanding the basic ecology of these vectors, which serve as the main drivers of pathogen transmission in both wildlife and human populations, is now more important than ever. © 2017 The Authors.

To understand lifespan evolution and its impact on plant adaptability, we carried out a comparative study of perennials and annuals in the genus Veronica from a phylogenetic perspective. The results showed that ancestors of the genus Veronica were likely to be perennial plants. Annual life history of Veronica has evolved multiple times and subtrees with more annual species have a higher substitution rate. Annuals can adapt to more xeric habitats than perennials. This indicates that annuals are more drought-resistant than their perennial relatives. Due to adaptation to similar selective pressures, parallel evolution occurs in morphological characters among annual species of Veronica. © 2016 Wang et al.},

	abstract = {Climate change has differentially affected the timing of seasonal events for interacting trophic levels, and this has often led to increased selection on seasonal timing. Yet, the environmental variables driving this selection have rarely been identified, limiting our ability to predict future ecological impacts of climate change. Using a dataset spanning 31 years from a natural population of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), we show that directional selection on timing of reproduction intensified in the first two decades (1980–2000) but weakened during the last decade (2001–2010). Against expectation, this pattern could not be explained by the temporal variation in the phenological mismatch with food abundance. We therefore explored an alternative hypothesis that selection on timing was affected by conditions individuals experience when arriving in spring at the breeding grounds: arriving early in cold conditions may reduce survival. First, we show that in female recruits, spring arrival date in the first breeding year correlates positively with hatch date; hence, early-hatched individuals experience colder conditions at arrival than late-hatched individuals. Second, we show that when temperatures at arrival in the recruitment year were high, early-hatched young had a higher recruitment probability than when temperatures were low. We interpret this as a potential cost of arriving early in colder years, and climate warming may have reduced this cost. We thus show that higher temperatures in the arrival year of recruits were associated with stronger selection for early reproduction in the years these birds were born. As arrival temperatures in the beginning of the study increased, but recently declined again, directional selection on timing of reproduction showed a nonlinear change. We demonstrate that environmental conditions with a lag of up to two years can alter selection on phenological traits in natural populations, something that has important implications for our understanding of how climate can alter patterns of selection in natural populations. © 2015 Visser et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Reptiles are sensitive to habitat disturbance induced by wildfires but species frequently show opposing responses. Functional causes of such variability have been scarcely explored. In the northernmost limit of the Mediterranean bioregion, lizard species of Mediterranean affinity (Psammodromus algirus and Podarcis guadarramae) increase in abundance in burnt areas whereas Atlantic species (Lacerta schreiberi and Podarcis bocagei) decrease. Timon lepidus, the largest Mediterranean lizard in the region, shows mixed responses depending on the locality and fire history. We tested whether such interspecific differences are of a functional nature, namely, if ecophysiological traits may determine lizard response to fire. Based on the variation in habitat structure between burnt and unburnt sites, we hypothesise that Mediterranean species, which increase density in open habitats promoted by frequent fire regimes, should be more thermophile and suffer lower water losses than Atlantic species. Methods. Wesubmitted 6-10 adult males of the five species to standard experiments for assessing preferred body temperatures (Tp) and evaporative water loss rates (EWL), and examined the variation among species and along time by means of repeated-measures AN(C)OVAs. Results. Results only partially supported our initial expectations, since the mediumsized P. algirus clearly attained higher Tp and lower EWL. The two small wall lizards (P. bocagei and P. guadarramae) displayed low Tp and high EWL while the two large green lizards (T. lepidus and L. schreiberi) displayed intermediate values for both parameters. Discussion. The predicted differences according to the biogeographic affinities within each pair were not fully confirmed. We conclude that ecophysiology may help to understand functional reptile responses to fire but other biological traits are also to be considered. © 2016 Ferreira et al.},

	abstract = {Summary Successful emergence from the soil is essential for plant establishment in natural and farmed systems. It has been assumed that the absence of light in the soil is the preeminent signal perceived during early seedling development, leading to a distinct morphogenic plan (skotomorphogenesis) [1], characterized by traits providing an adaptive advantage until emergence and photomorphogenesis. These traits include suppressed chlorophyll synthesis, promotion of hypocotyl elongation, and formation of a closed apical hook that protects the stem cell niche from damage [2, 3]. However, absence of light by itself is not a sufficient environmental signal for early seedling development [4, 5]. Reduced oxygen levels (hypoxia) can occur in water-logged soils [6-8]. We therefore hypothesized that below-ground hypoxia may be an important, but thus far undiscovered, ecological component regulating seedling development. Here, we show that survival and establishment of seedlings following darkness depend on their ability to sense hypoxia, through enhanced stability of group VII Ethylene Response Factor (ERFVII) transcription factors. Hypoxia is perceived as a positive environmental component in diverse taxa of flowering plants, promoting maintenance of skotomorphogenic traits. Hypoxia greatly enhances survival once light is perceived, while oxygen is necessary for the subsequent effective completion of photomorphogenesis. Together with light perception, oxygen sensing therefore allows an integrated response to the complex and changing physical microenvironment encountered during early seedling growth. We propose that plants monitor the soil's gaseous environment after germination, using hypoxia as a key external cue to protect the stem cell niche, thus ensuring successful rapid establishment upon emergence above ground. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Fresh water availability for agricultural use is a growing concern across the United States as well as many regions of the world. Short-term drought events along with regulatory intervention in the regulation of water availability coupled with the looming threat of long-term climate shifts that may lead to reduced precipitation in many important agricultural regions has increased the need to hasten the development of crops adapted for improved water use efficiency in order to maintain or expand production in the coming years. This protocol is not meant as a step-by-step guide to identifying at either the physiological or molecular level drought-tolerance traits in lettuce, but rather is a method developed and refined through the screening of thousands of different lettuce varieties. The nature of this screen is based in part on the streamlined measurements focusing on only three water-stress indicators: leaf relative water content, wilt, and differential plant growth following drought-stress. The purpose of rapidly screening a large germplasm collection is to narrow the candidate pool to a point in which more intensive physiological, molecular, and genetic methods can be applied to identify specific drought-tolerant traits in either the lab or field. Candidates can also be directly incorporated into breeding programs as a source of drought-tolerance traits. © 2015 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial License.},

	abstract = {Global warming is influencing the biology of the world's biota. Temperature increases are occurring at a faster pace than that experienced by organisms in their evolutionary histories, limiting the organisms' response to new conditions. Mechanistic models that include physiological traits can help predict species' responses to warming. Changes in metabolism at high temperatures are often examined; yet many species are behaviorally shielded from high temperatures. Salamanders generally favor cold temperatures and are one of few groups of metazoans to be most species-rich in temperate regions. I examined variation in body temperature, behavioral activity, and temperature dependence of resting heart rate, used as a proxy for standard metabolic rate, in fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra). Over 26 years, I found that salamanders are behaviorally active at temperatures as low as 1 ï¿½C, and aestivate at temperatures above 16 ï¿½C. Infrared thermography indicates limited thermoregulation opportunities for these nocturnal amphibians. Temperature affects resting heart rate, causing metabolic depression above 11 ï¿½C, and metabolic compensation below 8 ï¿½C: heart rate at 3 ï¿½C is 224% the expected heart rate. Thus, salamanders operating at low temperatures during periods of peak behavioral activity are able to maintain a higher metabolic rate than the rate expected in absence of compensation. This compensatory mechanism has important ecological implications, because it increases estimated seasonal heart rates. Increased heart rate, and thus metabolism, will require higher caloric intake for fieldactive salamanders. Thus, it is important to consider a species performance breadth over the entire temperature range, and particularly low temperatures that are ecologically relevant for cold tolerant species such as salamanders. ï¿½ 2016 Catenazzi.},

	abstract = {Malaria transmission is known to be strongly impacted by temperature. The current understanding of how temperature affects mosquito and parasite life history traits derives from a limited number of empirical studies. These studies, some dating back to the early part of last century, are often poorly controlled, have limited replication, explore a narrow range of temperatures, and use a mixture of parasite and mosquito species. Here, we use a single pairing of the Asian mosquito vector, An. stephensi and the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the thermal performance curves of a range of mosquito and parasite traits relevant to transmission. We show that biting rate, adult mortality rate, parasite development rate, and vector competence are temperature sensitive. Importantly, we find qualitative and quantitative differences to the assumed temperature-dependent relationships. To explore the overall implications of temperature for transmission, we first use a standard model of relative vectorial capacity. This approach suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 29°C, with minimum and maximum temperatures of 12°C and 38°C, respectively. However, the robustness of the vectorial capacity approach is challenged by the fact that the empirical data violate several of the model’s simplifying assumptions. Accordingly, we present an alternative model of relative force of infection that better captures the observed biology of the vector–parasite interaction. This model suggests a temperature optimum for transmission of 26°C, with a minimum and maximum of 17°C and 35°C, respectively. The differences between the models lead to potentially divergent predictions for the potential impacts of current and future climate change on malaria transmission. The study provides a framework for more detailed, system-specific studies that are essential to develop an improved understanding on the effects of temperature on malaria transmission. © 2017 Shapiro et al.},

	abstract = {Background. The introduction of exotic species can have serious consequences for marine ecosystems. On the shores of the Cantabrian Sea (North of Spain) there are no routine examinations of seaweeds that combine molecular and morphological methods for early detection of exotic species making it difficult to assess in the early stages their establishment and expansion processes as a result of anthropogenic activities (e.g., shipping and/or aquaculture). Methods. In this work we used both morphological identification and molecular barcoding (COI-5P and rbcL genes) of red algae collected in Asturias, Bay of Biscay (Gijón and Candás harbours) and from the University of Oviedo's herbarium samples. Results. The results confirmed the presence of exotic Asian seaweeds Pachymeniopsis gargiuli and Grateloupia turuturu Yamada on Cantabrian Sea shores. Several individuals of these species were fertile and developing cystocarps when collected, underlining the risk of possible expansion or continued establishment. This study constitutes the first report of the Asian P. gargiuli in this area of the Bay of Biscay. Conclusions. Here the presence of the exotic species of the Halymeniales P. gargiuli is confirmed.Wehypothesize that this species may have been established some time ago as a cryptic introduction with G. turuturu in Galician shores. The detection of these species on the shores of the Cantabrian Sea is relevant since introductions of Pachymeniopsis species could have been overlooked on other European coasts, probably mixed with G. turuturu and P. lanceolata. Our results confirm one new alien seaweed species that has been detected using molecular methods (COI-5P region and rbcL genes barcoding) on North Atlantic shores: the Asian native P. gargiuli. This demonstrates that routine screening for early detection of exotic algae in the Cantabrian Sea can be used for risk assessment. Genetic barcoding should be done using both rbcL gene and COI-5P regions since, although COI-databases are still poorer in sequences and this inhibits successful outcomes in Grateloupia-related species identifications, it is nonetheless a useful marker for species-level identifications in seaweeds. © 2017 Montes et al.},

	abstract = {Reef-building corals provide the structural basis for one of Earth's most spectacular and diverse—but increasingly threatened—ecosystems. Modern Indo-Pacific reefs are dominated by species of the staghorn coral genus Acropora, but the evolutionary and ecological factors associated with their diversification and rise to dominance are unclear. Recent work on evolutionary radiations has demonstrated the importance of introgression and ecological opportunity in promoting diversification and ecological success. Here, we analyze the genomes of five staghorn coral species to examine the roles of introgression and ecological opportunity in the rise to dominance of Acropora. We found evidence for a history marked by a major introgression event as well as recurrent gene flow across species. In addition, we found that genes with topologies mismatching the species tree are evolving faster, which is suggestive of a role for introgression in spreading adaptive genetic variation. Demographic analysis showed that Acropora lineages profited from climate-driven mass extinctions in the Plio-Pleistocene, indicating that Acropora exploited ecological opportunity opened by a new climatic regime favoring species that could cope with rapid sea-level changes. Collectively, the genomes of reef-building corals have recorded an evolutionary history shaped by introgression and climate change, suggesting that Acropora—among most vulnerable corals to stressors—may be critical for understanding how reefs track the impending rapid sea-level changes of the Anthropocene. Mao et al. show that a major introgression event as well as recurrent gene flow across Acropora coral species and Acropora lineages profited from climate-driven mass extinctions in the Plio-Pleistocene, indicating that introgression and ecological opportunity (from climate-driven mass extinction) play important roles in the adaptive radiation of Acropora. © 2018 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background. Biological invasions have become a major threat to biodiversity, and identifying determinants underlying success at different stages of the invasion process is essential for both prevention management and testing ecological theories. To investigate variables associated with different stages of the invasion process in a local region such as Taiwan, potential problems using traditional parametric analyses include too many variables of different data types (nominal, ordinal, and interval) and a relatively small data set with too many missing values. Methods. We therefore used five decision tree models instead and compared their performance. Our dataset contains 283 exotic bird species which were transported to Taiwan; of these 283 species, 95 species escaped to the field successfully (introduction success); of these 95 introduced species, 36 species reproduced in the field of Taiwan successfully (establishment success). For each species, we collected 22 variables associated with human selectivity and species traits which may determine success during the introduction stage and establishment stage. For each decision tree model, we performed three variable treatments: (I) including all 22 variables, (II) excluding nominal variables, and (III) excluding nominal variables and replacing ordinal values with binary ones. Five performance measures were used to compare models, namely, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), specificity, precision, recall, and accuracy. Results. The gradient boosting models performed best overall among the five decision tree models for both introduction and establishment success and across variable treat- ments. The most important variables for predicting introduction success were the bird family, the number of invaded countries, and variables associated with environmental adaptation, whereas the most important variables for predicting establishment success were the number of invaded countries and variables associated with reproduction. Discussion. Our final optimal models achieved relatively high performance values, and we discuss differences in performance with regard to sample size and variable treatments. Our results showed that, for both the establishment model and introduction model, the number of invaded countries was the most important or second most important determinant, respectively. Therefore, we suggest that future success for introduction and establishment of exotic birds may be gauged by simply looking at previous success in invading other countries. Finally, we found that species traits related to reproduction were more important in establishment models than in introduction models; importantly, these determinants were not averaged but either minimum or maximum values of species traits. Therefore, we suggest that in addition to averaged values, reproductive potential represented by minimum and maximum values of species traits should be considered in invasion studies. © 2017 Liang et al.},

	abstract = {Housing development beyond the urban fringe (i.e., exurban development) is one of the fastest growing forms of land-use change in the United States. Exurban development's attraction to natural and recreational amenities has raised concerns for conservation and represents a potential threat to wildlife. Although forest-dependent species have been found particularly sensitive to low housing densities, it is unclear how the spatial distribution of houses affects forest birds. The aim of this study was to assess forest bird responses to changes in the spatial pattern of exurban development and also to examine species responses when forest loss and forest fragmentation were considered. We evaluated landscape composition around North American Breeding Bird Survey stops between 1986 and 2009 by developing a compactness index to assess changes in the spatial pattern of exurban development over time. Compactness was defined as a measure of how clustered exurban development was in the area surrounding each survey stop at each time period considered. We used Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis to detect the response of forest and forest-edge species in terms of occurrence and relative abundance along the compactness gradient at two spatial scales (400-m and 1-km radius buffer). Our results showed that most forest birds and some forest-edge species were positively associated with high levels of compactness at the larger spatial scale; the proportion of forest in the surrounding landscape also had a significant effect when forest loss and forest fragmentation were accounted for. In contrast, the spatial configuration of exurban development was an important predictor of occurrence and abundance for only a few species at the smaller spatial scale. The positive response of forest birds to compactness at the larger scale could represent a systematic trajectory of decline and could be highly detrimental to bird diversity if exurban growth continues and creates more compacted development. © 2016 Suarez-Rubio and Lookingbill.},

	abstract = {Species are linked to each other by a myriad of positive and negative interactions. This complex spectrum of interactions constitutes a network of links that mediates ecological communities’ response to perturbations, such as exploitation and climate change. In the last decades, there have been great advances in the study of intricate ecological networks. We have, nonetheless, lacked both the data and the tools to more rigorously understand the patterning of multiple interaction types between species (i.e., “multiplex networks”), as well as their consequences for community dynamics. Using network statistical modeling applied to a comprehensive ecological network, which includes trophic and diverse non-trophic links, we provide a first glimpse at what the full “entangled bank” of species looks like. The community exhibits clear multidimensional structure, which is taxonomically coherent and broadly predictable from species traits. Moreover, dynamic simulations suggest that this non-random patterning of how diverse non-trophic interactions map onto the food web could allow for higher species persistence and higher total biomass than expected by chance and tends to promote a higher robustness to extinctions. © 2016 Kéfi et al.},

C. solstitialis had been reported to be diploid (2nD2x D16 chromosomes), however, actual data are scarce and sometimes contradictory. We determined for the first time the absolute nuclear DNA content by flow cytometry and estimated ploidy level in 52 natural populations of C. solstitialis across its native and non-native ranges, around the world. All the C. solstitialis populations screened were found to be homogeneously diploid (average 2C value of 1.72 pg, SD D=0.06 pg), with no significant variation in DNA content between invasive and non-invasive genotypes. We did not find any meaningful difference among the extensive number of native and non-native C. solstitialis populations sampled around the globe, indicating that the species invasive success is not due to changes in genome size or ploidy level. © 2017 Irimia et al.},

Here, we developed a method comprising the miR-200 family and grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) to mimic this MET-like phenomenon observed in sarcoma patient samples.We sequentially express GRHL2 and the miR-200 family using cell transduction and transfection, respectively, to better understand the molecular underpinnings of these phenotypic transitions in sarcoma cells. Sarcoma cells expressing miR-200s and GRHL2 demonstrated enhanced epithelial characteristics in cell morphology and alteration of epithelial and mesenchymal biomarkers.

	abstract = {The alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau are sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. However, it is still unknown how precipitation use efficiency (PUE), the ratio of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) to precipitation, is related to community assembly of plant species, functional groups or traits for the Tibetan alpine grasslands along actual environmental gradients. We conducted a multisite field survey at grazing-excluded pastures across meadow, steppe and desertsteppe to measure aboveground biomass (AGB) in August, 2010. We used species richness (SR), the Shannon diversity index, and cover-weighted functional group composition (FGC) of 1-xerophytes, 2-mesophytes, and 3-hygrophytes to describe community assembly at the species level; and chose community-level leaf area index (LAIc), specific leaf area (SLAc), and species-mixed foliar δ13C to quantify community assembly at the functional trait level. Our results showed that PUE decreased with increasing accumulated active temperatures (AccT) when daily temperature average is higher than 5 °C, but increased with increasing climatic moisture index (CMI), which was demined as the ratio of growing season precipitation (GSP) to AccT. We also found that PUE increased with increasing SR, the Shannon diversity index, FGC and LAIc, decreased with increasing foliar δ13C, and had no relation with SLAc at the regional scale. Neither soil total nitrogen (STN) nor organic carbon has no influence on PUE at the regional scale. The community assembly of the Shannon index, LAIc and SLAc together accounted for 46.3% of variance in PUE, whilst CMI accounted for 47.9% of variance in PUE at the regional scale. This implies that community structural properties and plant functional traits can mediate the sensitivity of alpine grassland productivity in response to climate change. Thus, a long-term observation on community structural and functional changes is recommended for better understanding the response of alpine ecosystems to regional climate change on the Tibetan Plateau.

	abstract = {The degree to which molecular and morphological loss of function occurs synchronously during the vestigialization of traits is not well understood. The mammalian vomeronasal system, a sense critical for mediating many social and reproductive behaviors, is highly conserved across mammals. New World Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are under strong selection to maintain a functional vomeronasal system such that most phyllostomids possess a distinct vomeronasal organ and an intact TRPC2, a gene encoding a protein primarily involved in vomeronasal sensory neuron signal transduction. Recent genetic evidence, however, shows that TRPC2 is a pseudogene in some Caribbean nectarivorous phyllostomids. The loss-of-function mutations suggest the sensory neural tissue of the vomeronasal organ is absent in these species despite strong selection on this gene in its mainland relatives, but the anatomy was unknown in most Caribbean nectarivorous phyllostomids until this study. We used diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT) to test whether the vomeronasal and main olfactory anatomy of several phyllostomid species matched genetic evidence of function, providing insight into whether loss of a structure is linked to pseudogenization of a molecular component of the system. The vomeronasal organ is indeed rudimentary or absent in species with a disrupted TRPC2 gene. Caribbean nectar-feeders also exhibit derived olfactory turbinal morphology and a large olfactory recess that differs from closely related bats that have an intact vomeronasal organ, which may hint that the main olfactory system may compensate for loss. We emphasize non-invasive diceCT is capable of detecting the vomeronasal organ, providing a feasible approach for quantifying mammalian chemosensory anatomy across species. © 2018 Yohe, Hoffmann and Curtis.},

The results showed the following: (1) AR and VR scenes led to feelings of discomfort, but the subjective anxiety scores obtained in the two scenes were not significantly different; (2) the skin conductance level of the subjects significantly increased from the baseline when the subjects entered the experimental scene but remained active in the two scenes without showing significant difference between the scenes; and (3) the heart rate index significantly increased from the baseline after the subjects entered the scene and then gradually decreased. The heart rates of the subjects significantly increased again when the anxiety-induced event was triggered. However, no significant difference was observed between AR and VR scenes. AR and VR have induced obvious anxiety, which was reflected in the subjective and objective physiological indicators. However, no significant difference was found in the effects of AR and VR on the induced anxiety. Considering the cost of building two scenes and other factors, AR was more suitable for the treatment of claustrophobia than VR. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Knowledge on how functional responses (a measurement of feeding interaction strength) are affected by patch size and habitat complexity (represented by refuge availability) is crucial for understanding food-web stability and subsequently biodiversity. Due to their laborious character, it is almost impossible to carry out systematic empirical experiments on functional responses across wide gradients of patch sizes and refuge availabilities. Here we overcame this issue by using an individual-based model (IBM) to simulate feeding experiments. The model is based on empirically measured traits such as body-mass dependent speed and capture success. We simulated these experiments in patches ranging from sizes of petri dishes to natural patches in the field. Moreover, we varied the refuge availability within the patch independently of patch size, allowing for independent analyses of both variables. The maximum feeding rate (the maximum number of prey a predator can consume in a given time frame) is independent of patch size and refuge availability, as it is the physiological upper limit of feeding rates. Moreover, the results of these simulations revealed that a type III functional response, which is known to have a stabilizing effect on population dynamics, fitted the data best. The half saturation density (the prey density where a predator consumes half of its maximum feeding rate) increased with refuge availability but was only marginally influenced by patch size. Subsequently, we investigated how patch size and refuge availability influenced stability and coexistence of predator-prey systems. Following common practice, we used an allometric scaled Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model based on results from our in silico IBM experiments. The results suggested that densities of both populations are nearly constant across the range of patch sizes simulated, resulting from the constant interaction strength across the patch sizes. However, constant densities with decreasing patch sizes mean a decrease of absolute number of individuals, consequently leading to extinction of predators in the smallest patches. Moreover, increasing refuge availabilities also allowed predator and prey to coexist by decreased interaction strengths. Our results underline the need for protecting large patches with high habitat complexity to sustain biodiversity. © 2017 Li et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Worldwide predictions suggest that up to 75% of the freshwater fish species occurring in rivers with reduced discharge could be extinct by 2070 due to the combined effect of climate change and water abstraction. The Mediterranean region is considered to be a hotspot of freshwater fish diversity but also one of the regions where the effects of climate change will be more severe. Iberian cyprinids are currently highly endangered, with over 68% of the species raising some level of conservation concern. Methods. During the FISHATLAS project, the Portuguese hydrographical network was extensively covered (all the 34 river basins and 47 sub-basins) in order to contribute with valuable data on the genetic diversity distribution patterns of native cyprinid species. A total of 188 populations belonging to 16 cyprinid species of Squalius, Luciobarbus, Achondrostoma, Iberochondrostoma, Anaecypris and Pseudochondrostoma were characterized, for a total of 3,678 cytochrome b gene sequences. Results. When the genetic diversity of these populations was mapped, it highlighted differences among populations from the same species and between species with identical distribution areas. Factors shaping the contemporary patterns of genetic diversity were explored and the results revealed the role of latitude, inter-basin connectivity, migratory behaviour, species maximum size, species range and other species intrinsic traits in determining the genetic diversity of sampled populations. Contrastingly, drainage area and hydrological regime (permanent vs. temporary) seem to have no significant effect on genetic diversity. Species intrinsic traits, maximum size attained, inter-basin connectivity and latitude explained over 30% of the haplotype diversity variance and, generally, the levels of diversity were significantly higher for smaller sized species, from connected and southerly river basins. © 2016 Sousa-Santos et al.},

Consequently, cheat invasion is often considered equal to extinction in empirical and theoretical studies of cooperator-cheat dynamics. But does cheat invasion necessarily equate extinction in nature? By following the social dynamics of iron metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis lung infection, we observed that individuals evolved to replace cooperation with a ‘private’ behaviour. Phenotypic assays showed that cooperative iron acquisition frequently was upregulated early in infection, which, however, increased the risk of cheat invasion. With whole-genome sequencing we showed that if, and only if, cooperative iron acquisition is lost from the population, a private system was upregulated. The benefit of upregulation depended on iron availability. These findings highlight the importance of social dynamics of natural populations and emphasizes the potential impact of past social interaction on the evolution of private traits. © Andersen et al.},

	abstract = {Leaf functional traits are important because they reflect physiological functions, such as transpiration and carbon assimilation. In particular, morphological leaf traits have the potential to summarize plants strategies in terms of water use efficiency, growth pattern and nutrient use. The leaf economics spectrum (LES) is a recognized framework in functional plant ecology and reflects a gradient of increasing specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen, phosphorus and cation content, and decreasing leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and carbon nitrogen ratio (CN). The LES describes different strategies ranging from that of short-lived leaves with high photosynthetic capacity per leaf mass to long-lived leaves with low mass-based carbon assimilation rates. However, traits that are not included in the LES might provide additional information on the species' physiology, such as those related to stomatal control. Protocols are presented for a wide range of leaf functional traits, including traits of the LES, but also traits that are independent of the LES. In particular, a new method is introduced that relates the plants’ regulatory behavior in stomatal conductance to vapor pressure deficit. The resulting parameters of stomatal regulation can then be compared to the LES and other plant functional traits. The results show that functional leaf traits of the LES were also valid predictors for the parameters of stomatal regulation. For example, leaf carbon concentration was positively related to the vapor pressure deficit (vpd) at the point of inflection and the maximum of the conductance-vpd curve. However, traits that are not included in the LES added information in explaining parameters of stomatal control: the vpd at the point of inflection of the conductance-vpd curve was lower for species with higher stomatal density and higher stomatal index. Overall, stomata and vein traits were more powerful predictors for explaining stomatal regulation than traits used in the LES. © 2015 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

We present a hybrid continuous-discrete mathematical model of tumour growth and the chemotropism phenomenon to show that such a chemorepellent factor can also act as a promoter of self-metastases, a mechanism for tumour expansion we have previously shown can explain several essential kinetic dependencies of tumour growth. A sufficient criterion for this expansion was found to be the passive migration of peripheral cancer stem and non-stem cells away from the main tumour mass, where migrating cancer stem cells form new clusters. We show here how the introduction of an active repellent trait serves to accelerate peripheral migration and thus, by the self-metastases principle, accelerate tumour growth. These results provide a mechanistic basis for the proposal that chemorepellent action in gliomas may underlie their rapid growth. © The author 2010.

	abstract = {Patterns of phenotypic change across environmental gradients (e.g., latitude, altitude) have long captivated the interest of evolutionary ecologists. The pattern and magnitude of phenotypic change is determined by the covariance between genetic and environmental influences across a gradient. Cogradient variation (CoGV) occurs when covariance is positive: that is, genetic and environmental influences on phenotypic expression are aligned and their joint influence accentuates the change in mean trait value across the gradient. Conversely, countergradient variation (CnGV) occurs when covariance is negative: that is, genetic and environmental influences on phenotypes oppose one another, thereby diminishing the change in mean trait expression across the gradient. CnGV has so far been found in at least 60 species, with most examples coming from fishes, amphibians, and insects across latitudinal or altitudinal gradients. Traits that display CnGV most often involve metabolic compensation, that is, the elevation of various physiological rates processes (development, growth, feeding, metabolism, activity) to counteract the dampening effect of reduced temperature, growing season length, or food supply. Far fewer examples of CoGV have been identified (11 species), and these most often involve morphological characters. Increased knowledge of spatial covariance patterns has furthered our understanding of Bergmann size clines, phenotypic plasticity, species range limits, tradeoffs in juvenile growth rate, and the design of conservation strategies for wild species. Moreover, temporal CnGV explains some cases of an apparent lack of phenotypic response to directional selection and provides a framework for predicting evolutionary responses to climate change. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {The recent intensification of the arable landscape by modern agriculture has had negative effects on biodiversity. Organic farming has been introduced to mitigate negative effects, but is organic farming beneficial to biodiversity? In this review, we summarize recent research on the effects of organic farming on arable biodiversity of plants, arthropods, soil biota, birds, and mammals. The ecosystem services of pollination, biological control, seed predation, and decomposition are also included in this review. So far, organic farming seems to enhance the species richness and abundance of many common taxa, but its effects are often species specific and trait or context dependant. The landscape surrounding the focal field or farm also seems to be important. Landscape either enhances or reduces the positive effects of organic farming or acts via interactions where the surrounding landscape affects biodiversity or ecosystem services differently on organic and conventional farms. Finally, we discuss some of the potential mechanisms behind these results and how organic farming may develop in the future to increase its potential for sustaining biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. © 2012 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Temperature regime is known to have considerable influence on the life-histories of fish. Topmouth gudgeon is a very successful invader with high biological flexibility and phenotypic plasticity. The flexibility of topmouth gudgeon in a normal thermal regime has been well described, however there has been no information published about how it would cope with extreme conditions, e.g. permanently heated water. Several studies have demonstrated that phenotypic plasticity provides an important advantage to invasive species. To explain their invasion success, the theory of alternative ontogenies and invasive potential has been proposed. The aim of the present study was to examine if the reproductive parameters of a population living in permanently heated water differ from those living in habitats with a normal temperature regime, as well as to test a hypothesis derived from the theory of alternative ontogenies and invasive potential. Over a period of 8 years (2004-2011), a high variation in the reproductive parameters of topmouth gudgeon from Lake Licheńskie was found. With a small exception, all the observed results met the expectations predicted by the hypothesis tested. This indicates that topmouth gudgeon retains high phenotypic plasticity in life-history traits even in a habitat with extreme conditions, which is important for the species' invasion success. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	abstract = {Water is a key resource, and the plant water transport system sets limits on maximum growth and drought tolerance. When plants open their stomata to achieve a high stomatal conductance (gs) to capture CO2 for photosynthesis, water is lost by transpiration(1,2). Water evaporating from the airspaces is replaced from cell walls, in turn drawing water from the xylem of leaf veins, in turn drawing from xylem in the stems and roots. As water is pulled through the system, it experiences hydraulic resistance, creating tension throughout the system and a low leaf water potential (Ψ(leaf)). The leaf itself is a critical bottleneck in the whole plant system, accounting for on average 30% of the plant hydraulic resistance(3). Leaf hydraulic conductance (K(leaf) = 1/ leaf hydraulic resistance) is the ratio of the water flow rate to the water potential gradient across the leaf, and summarizes the behavior of a complex system: water moves through the petiole and through several orders of veins, exits into the bundle sheath and passes through or around mesophyll cells before evaporating into the airspace and being transpired from the stomata. K(leaf) is of strong interest as an important physiological trait to compare species, quantifying the effectiveness of the leaf structure and physiology for water transport, and a key variable to investigate for its relationship to variation in structure (e.g., in leaf venation architecture) and its impacts on photosynthetic gas exchange. Further, K(leaf) responds strongly to the internal and external leaf environment(3). K(leaf) can increase dramatically with irradiance apparently due to changes in the expression and activation of aquaporins, the proteins involved in water transport through membranes(4), and K(leaf) declines strongly during drought, due to cavitation and/or collapse of xylem conduits, and/or loss of permeability in the extra-xylem tissues due to mesophyll and bundle sheath cell shrinkage or aquaporin deactivation(5-10). Because K(leaf) can constrain gs and photosynthetic rate across species in well watered conditions and during drought, and thus limit whole-plant performance they may possibly determine species distributions especially as droughts increase in frequency and severity(11-14). We present a simple method for simultaneous determination of K(leaf) and gs on excised leaves. A transpiring leaf is connected by its petiole to tubing running to a water source on a balance. The loss of water from the balance is recorded to calculate the flow rate through the leaf. When steady state transpiration (E, mmol • m(-2) • s(-1)) is reached, gs is determined by dividing by vapor pressure deficit, and K(leaf) by dividing by the water potential driving force determined using a pressure chamber (K(leaf)= E /- Δψ(leaf), MPa)(15). This method can be used to assess K(leaf) responses to different irradiances and the vulnerability of K(leaf) to dehydration(14,16,17).},

A statistical technique is described that permits the detection and identification of such functional groups. The method is accretional, based on identification of associated neurons through iterative application of a significance test on multiple coincidences of neuronal firings within an observational window. Examples of the operation of the method and indications as to its sensitivity are furnished through computer simulations of neural network. The entire algorithm may be used a screening technique to select smaller groups of neurons for cross-corelational and related finer-grained temporal analyses, or it may be used in its own right to detect and characterize functional groups that are not distinguishable by other statistical procedures. © 1978.},

These effects are enhanced in people exposed to combined air pollutants, such as ozone and cigarette smoke. Chronic exposure to these pollutants causes an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation and has been associated with an increase in pulmonary diseases and mortality. Clinical and epidemiological studies reported interindividual variability in the adverse health effects of air pollutants, suggesting a genetic predisposition. The identification of subgroups of the population who are particularly vulnerable to air pollution is, therefore, of importance. Mouse models are a useful tool for studying the mechanisms underlying different susceptibility, as they show differences in strain responses to both ozone and cigarette smoke.

	abstract = {Hybridization between hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) breeding groups is unusually common in Bahia state, Brazil. Such hybridiza-tion is possible because hawksbill and loggerhead nesting activities overlap tempo-rally and spatially along the coast of this state. Nevertheless, the destinations of their offspring are not yet known. This study is the first to identify immature hawksbill × loggerhead hybrids (n = 4) from this rookery by analyzing the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 157 immature turtles morphologically identified as hawksbills. We also compare for the first time modeled dispersal patterns of hawksbill, logger-head, and hybrid offspring considering hatching season and oceanic phase duration of turtles. Particle movements varied according to season, with a higher proportion of particles dispersing southwards throughout loggerhead and hybrid hatching sea-sons, and northwards during hawksbill season. Hybrids from Bahia were not present in important hawksbill feeding grounds of Brazil, being detected only at areas more common for loggerheads. The genetic and oceanographic findings of this work indi-cate that these immature hybrids, which are morphologically similar to hawksbills, could be adopting behavioral traits typical of loggerheads, such as feeding in tem-perate waters of the western South Atlantic. Understanding the distribution, ecology, and migrations of these hybrids is essential for the development of adequate conser-vation and management plans.© 2014 Proietti et al.},

	abstract = {Conflict between the sexes over reproductive interests can drive rapid evolution of reproductive traits and promote speciation. Here we show that inter-species mating between Caenorhabditis nematodes sterilizes maternal individuals. The principal effectors of male-induced harm are sperm cells, which induce sterility and shorten lifespan by displacing conspecific sperm, invading the ovary, and sometimes breaching the gonad to infiltrate other tissues. This sperm-mediated harm is pervasive across species, but idiosyncrasies in its magnitude implicate both independent histories of sexually antagonistic coevolution within species and differences in reproductive mode (self-fertilizing hermaphrodites versus females) in determining its severity. Consistent with this conclusion, in androdioecious species the hermaphrodites are more vulnerable, the males more benign, or both. Patterns of assortative mating and a low incidence of invasive sperm occurring with conspecific mating are indicative of ongoing intra-specific sexual conflict that results in inter-species reproductive incompatibility. © 2014 Ting et al.},

Surprisingly, most of these changes were towards a smaller size. Black rats were introduced to Anacapa Island in the mid-1800s (probably in 1853) and eradicated in 2001-2002. To assess possible changes in these rats since their introduction, eleven cranial and four standard external measurements were taken from 59 Rattus rattus specimens collected from 1940-2000. All rat cranial traits changed 3.06-10.43% (724-2567 d, 0.06-0.42 h), and all became larger. When considered in haldanes, these changes are among the fastest on record in any organism, and far exceed changes found in other island rodents. These changes were confirmed by MANOVA (Wilk's λ < 0.0005, Fd.f.15 = 2974.386, P < 0.0005), and all 11 cranial traits significantly fit linear regressions. We speculate that concurrent changes in mice may have been due in part to competition with and/or predation by rats.

Despite their popularity trait-based comparative analyses tend to focus on explaining variation in range shift and extinction risk, seldombeing applied to actual measures of species decline. Furthermore they have tended to be taxonomically restricted to birds, mammals, plants and butterflies. Here we utilise a novel approach to estimate occurrence trends for the Odonata in Britain and Ireland, and examine trait correlates of these trends using a recently available trait dataset. We found the dragonfly fauna in Britain and Ireland has undergone considerable change between 1980 and 2012, with 22 and 53% of species declining and increasing, respectively. Distribution region, habitat specialism and range size were the key traits associated with these trends, where habitat generalists that occupy southern Britain tend to have increased in comparison to the declining narrow-ranged specialist species. In combination with previous evidence, we conclude that the lower trend estimates for the narrow-ranged specialists could be a sign of biotic homogenization with ecological specialists being replaced by warm-adapted generalists.},

	abstract = {In the field of invasion ecology, the determination of a species' environmental tolerance, is a key parameter in the prediction of its potential distribution, particularly in the context of global warming. In poikilothermic species such as insects, temperature is often considered the most important abiotic factor that affects numerous life-history and fitness traits through its effect on metabolic rate. Therefore the response of an insect to challenging temperatures may provide key information as to its climatic and therefore spatial distribution. Variation in the phosphoglucose-6-isomerase (PGI) metabolic enzyme-system has been proposed in some insects to underlie their relative fitness, and is recognised as a key enzyme in their thermal adaptation. However, in this context it has not been considered as a potential mechanism contributing to a species invasive cability. The present study aimed to compare the thermal tolerance of an invasive scarabaeid beetle, Costelytra zealandica (White) with that of the closely related, and in part sympatrically occurring, congeneric non-invasive species C. brunneum (Broun), and to consider whether any correlation with particular PGI genotypes was apparent. Third instar larvae of each species were exposed to one of three different temperatures (10, 15 and 20°C) over six weeks and their fitness (survival and growth rate) measured and PGI phenotyping performed via cellulose acetate electrophoresis. No consistent relationship between PGI genotypes and fitness was detected, suggesting that PGI may not be contributing to the invasion success and pest status of C. zealandica. © 2014 Lefort et al.},

	abstract = {Mechanistic determinants of bacterial growth, death, and spread within mammalian hosts cannot be fully resolved studying a single bacterial population. They are also currently poorly understood. Here, we report on the application of sophisticated experimental approaches to map spatiotemporal population dynamics of bacteria during an infection. We analyzed heterogeneous traits of simultaneous infections with tagged Salmonella enterica populations (wild-type isogenic tagged strains [WITS]) in wild-type and gene-targeted mice. WITS are phenotypically identical but can be distinguished and enumerated by quantitative PCR, making it possible, using probabilistic models, to estimate bacterial death rate based on the disappearance of strains through time. This multidisciplinary approach allowed us to establish the timing, relative occurrence, and immune control of key infection parameters in a true host-pathogen combination. Our analyses support a model in which shortly after infection, concomitant death and rapid bacterial replication lead to the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs, a process controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased microbial mortality leads to an exponential increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally, with subsequent mixing of bacteria between organs via bacteraemia and further stochastic selection. This approach provides us with an unprecedented outlook on the pathogenesis of S. enterica infections, illustrating the complex spatial and stochastic effects that drive an infectious disease. The application of the novel method that we present in appropriate and diverse host-pathogen combinations, together with modelling of the data that result, will facilitate a comprehensive view of the spatial and stochastic nature of within-host dynamics. © 2008 Grant et al.},

	abstract = {Marked impacts of climate change on biodiversity have frequently been demonstrated, including temperature-related shifts in phenology and life-history traits. One potential major impact of climate change is the modification of synchronization between the phenology of different trophic levels. High phenotypic plasticity in laying date has allowed many bird species to track the increasingly early springs resulting from recent environmental change, but although changes in the timing of reproduction have been well studied in birds, these questions have only recently been addressed in mammals. To track peak resource availability, large herbivores like roe deer, with a widespread distribution across Europe, should also modify their life-history schedule in response to changes in vegetation phenology over time. In this study, we analysed the influence of climate change on the timing of roe deer births and the consequences for population demography and individual fitness. Our study provides a rare quantification of the demographic costs associated with the failure of a species to modify its phenology in response to a changing world. Given these fitness costs, the lack of response of roe deer birth dates to match the increasingly earlier onset of spring is in stark contrast with the marked phenotypic responses to climate change reported in many other mammals. We suggest that the lack of phenotypic plasticity in birth timing in roe deer is linked to its inability to track environmental cues of variation in resource availability for the timing of parturition. © 2014 Plard et al.},

Theory and case studies suggest that indirect effects associated with species interactions may alter these direct responses. How can we tractably predict in which cases indirect effects are likely to be important and appropriately model the interaction of abiotic and biotic drivers? One viable strategy is to characterize partitioning between species along thermal, temporal, and spatial niche axes. The partitioning can be informed by assessing functional traits. Mechanistic models can then be applied to predict how climate change will alter niche partitioning. I illustrate this approach by asking whether competition has altered the responses of Caribbean Anolis lizards to recent warming and find that forested habitat has become more suitable for a warm-adapted, open species, and less suitable for a cool-adapted forest inhabitant. Competition may result in competitive displacement of the cool-adapted species as the warm-adapted species moves into the forest. Species interactions may accentuate abundance and distribution shifts predicted in response to climate change along the elevation gradient. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Because obesity is associated with diverse chronic diseases, little attention has been directed to the multiple beneficial functions of adipose tissue. Adipose tissue not only provides energy for growth, reproduction and immune function, but also secretes and receives diverse signaling molecules that coordinate energy allocation between these functions in response to ecological conditions. Importantly, many relevant ecological cues act on growth and physique, with adiposity responding as a counterbalancing risk management strategy. The large number of individual alleles associated with adipose tissue illustrates its integration with diverse metabolic pathways. However, phenotypic variation in age, sex, ethnicity and social status is further associated with different strategies for storing and using energy. Adiposity therefore represents a key means of phenotypic flexibility within and across generations, enabling a coherent life-history strategy in the face of ecological stochasticity. The sensitivity of numerous metabolic pathways to ecological cues makes our species vulnerable to manipulative globalized economic forces. The aim of this article is to understand how human adipose tissue biology interacts with modern environmental pressures to generate excess weight gain and obesity. The disease component of obesity might lie not in adipose tissue itself, but in its perturbation by our modern industrialized niche. Efforts to combat obesity could be more effective if they prioritized 'external' environmental change rather than attempting to manipulate 'internal' biology through pharmaceutical or behavioral means. © 2012.

	abstract = {The ability of pathogenic bacteria to exploit their hosts depends upon various virulence factors, released in response to the concentration of small autoinducer molecules that are also released by the bacteria [1-5]. In vitro experiments suggest that autoinducer molecules are signals used to coordinate cooperative behaviors and that this process of quorum sensing (QS) can be exploited by individual cells that avoid the cost of either producing or responding to signal [6, 7]. However, whether QS is an exploitable social trait in vivo, and the implications for the evolution of virulence [5, 8-10], remains untested. We show that in mixed infections of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, containing quorum-sensing bacteria and mutants that do not respond to signal, virulence in an animal (mouse) model is reduced relative to that of an infection containing no mutants. We show that this is because mutants act as cheats, exploiting the cooperative production of signal and virulence factors by others, and hence increase in frequency. This supports the idea that the invasion of QS mutants in infections of humans [11-13] is due to their social fitness consequences [6, 7, 14] and predicts that increased strain diversity will select for lower virulence. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Long-distance migratory birds often show little phenotypic variation in the timing of life-history events like breeding, molt, or migration. It has been hypothesized that this could result from low levels of heritable variation. If this were true, the adaptability of long-distance migratory birds would be limited, which would explain the vulnerability of this group of birds to environmental changes. The amount of phenotypic, environmental, and genetic variation in the onset of autumn migratory activity was assessed in two garden warbler (Sylvia borin) populations differing in breeding phenology and the length of the breeding season with the aim of investigating the effects of selection on the adaptability of long-distance migrants. High heritabilities and additive genetic variance components for the timing of autumn migration were found in both populations. Although genetic variation in the mountain population was lower than in the lowlands, this difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, no evidence was found for reduced levels of genetic variation in the garden warbler as compared to its sister species, the blackcap (S. atricapilla). Environmental variation, however, was markedly reduced in the garden warbler, suggesting that low levels of phenotypic variation typically found in long-distance migrants may be a consequence of environmental canalization of migratory traits. The buffering of environmental variation may be an adaptive response to strong stabilizing selection on the timing of migration. High environmental canalization of migration phenology in long-distance migrants could potentially explain low rates of immediate phenotypic change in response to environmental change. © 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Reduced male aggression towards different phenotypes generating negative frequency-dependent intrasexual selection has been suggested as a mechanism to facilitate the invasion and maintenance of novel phenotypes in a population. To date, the best empirical evidence for the phenomenon has been provided by laboratory studies on cichlid fish with different colour polymorphisms. Here we experimentally tested the hypothesis in a natural population of Lake Malawi cichlid fish, in which males build sand-castles (bowers) to attract females during seasonal leks. We predicted that if bower shape plays an important role in male aggressive interactions, aggression among conspecific males should decrease when their bower shape is altered. Accordingly, we allocated randomly chosen bowers in a Nyassachromis cf. microcephalus lek into three treatments: control, manipulated to a different shape, and simulated manipulation. We then measured male behaviours and bower shape before and after these treatments. We found that once bower shape was altered, males were involved in significantly fewer aggressive interactions with conspecific males than before manipulation. Mating success was not affected. Our results support the idea that an extended phenotype, such as bower shape, can be important in maintaining polymorphic populations. Specifically, reduced male conspecific aggression towards males with different extended phenotypes (here, bower shapes) may cause negative frequency-dependent selection, allowing the invasion and establishment of a new phenotype (bower builder). This could help our understanding of mechanisms of diversification within populations, and in particular, the overall diversification of bower shapes within LakeMalawi cichlids. © 2013 Magalhaes et al.},

It may thus lead seasonal organisms to face different day lengths than in the past, and the fitness consequences of these changes are as yet unclear. To study such effects, we used the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum as a model organism, as it has obligately asexual clones which can be used to study day length effects without eliciting a seasonal response. We recorded life-history traits under short and long days, both with two realistic temperature cycles with means differing by 2 °C. In addition, we measured the population growth of aphids on their host plant Pisum sativum. We show that short days reduce fecundity and the length of the reproductive period of aphids. Nevertheless, this does not translate into differences at the population level because the observed fitness costs only become apparent late in the individual's life. As expected, warmtemperature shortens the development time by 0.7 days/°C, leading to faster generation times.We found no interaction of temperature and day length. We conclude that day length changes cause only relatively mild costs, which may not decelerate the increase in pest status due to climate change. © 2015 Joschinski et al.},

	abstract = {An evolutionary theory of self-deception - the active misrepresentation of reality to the conscious mind - suggests that there may be multiple sources of self-deception in our own species, with important interactions between them. Self-deception (along with internal conflict and fragmentation) may serve to improve deception of others; this may include denial of ongoing deception, self-inflation, ego-biased social theory, false narratives of intention, and a conscious mind that operates via denial and projection to create a self-serving world. Self-deception may also result from internal representations of the voices of significant others, including parents, and may come from internal genetic conflict, the most important for our species arising from differentially imprinted maternal and paternal genes. Selection also favors suppressing negative phenotypic traits. Finally, a positive form of self-deception may serve to orient the organism favorably toward the future. Self-deception can be analyzed in groups and is done so here with special attention to its costs.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems around the world are experiencing unprecedented rates of extinction and species decline. The question of how community disassembly - the ongoing process of nonrandom species losses and declines - affects ecosystem functions, including those that influence persistence of other species, is addressed. The order in which species disappear from a community depends on their vulnerability to specific stressors and on traits associated with inherent susceptibility to decline. Information on species characteristics associated with vulnerability (response traits) is synthesized, and it is asked whether they are associated with characteristics that underpin significant contributions to ecosystem functioning (effect traits). Direct evidence that community disassembly affects ecosystem functioning comes from a variety of sources, ranging from documentation of long-term changes following the loss of an initial species or fragmentation of a landscape, to modeling and manipulative experiments that simulate species losses and observe their consequences. The usefulness to conservation and restoration practice of community disassembly as a concept is evaluated, and it is asked whether and how community disassembly can provide guidance about species loss order, its consequences, what each of these depends on, and whether a positive link exists between vulnerability and contribution to function - a link that would exacerbate the consequences of the ongoing extinction crisis. © 2009 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Immunity is an important biological trait that influences the survival of individuals and the fitness of a species. Immune defenses are costly and likely compete for energy with other life-history traits, such as reproduction and growth, affecting the overall fitness of a species. Competition among these traits in scleractinian corals could influence the dynamics and structural integrity of coral reef communities. Due to variability in biological traits within populations and across species, it is likely that coral colonies within population/species adjust their immune systemto the available resources. In corals, the innate immune system is composed of various pathways. The immune systemcomponents can be assessed in the absence (constitutive levels) and/or presence of stressors/pathogens (immune response). Comparisons of the constitutive levels of three immune pathways (melanin synthesis, antioxidant and antimicrobial) of closely related species of Scleractinian corals allowed to determine the link between immunity and reproduction and colony growth. First, we explored differences in constitutive immunity among closely related coral species of the genus Meandrina with different reproductive patterns (gonochoric vs. hermaphrodite). We then compared fast-growing branching vs. slow-growing massive Porites to test co-variation between constitutive immunity and growth rates and morphology in corals. Results indicate that there seems to be a relationship between constitutive immunity and sexual pattern with gonochoric species showing significantly higher levels of immunity than hermaphrodites. Therefore, gonochoric species maybe better suited to resist infections and overcome stressors. Constitutive immunity varied in relation with growth rates and colony morphology, but each species showed contrasting trends within the studied immune pathways. Fast-growing branching species appear to invest more in relatively low cost pathways of the immune system than slow-growing massive species. In corals, energetic investments in life-history traits such as reproduction and growth rate (higher energy investment) seemto have a significant impact on their capacity to respond to stressors, including infectious diseases and coral bleaching. These differences in energy investment are critical in the light of the recent environmental challenges linked to global climate change affecting these organisms. Understanding physiological trade-offs, especially those involving the immune system, will improve our understanding as to how corals could/will respond and survive in future adverse environmental conditions associated with climate change. © 2014 Pinzón C. et al.},

	abstract = {Many experiments require early determination of offspring's sex as well as early marking of newborns for individual recognition. According to animal welfare guidelines, non-invasive techniques should be preferred whenever applicable. In our group, we work on different species of song birds in the lab and in the field, and we successfully apply non-invasive methods to sex and individually mark chicks. This paper presents a comprehensive non-invasive tool-box. Sexing birds prior to the expression of secondary sexual traits requires the collection of DNA-bearing material for PCR We established a quick and easy method to sex birds of any age (post hatching) by extracting DNA from buccal swabs. Results can be obtained within 3 hours. For individual marking chick's down feathers are trimmed in specific patterns allowing fast identification within the hatching order. This set of methods is easily applicable in a standard equipped lab and especially suitable for working in the field as no special equipment is required for sampling and storage. Handling of chicks is minimized and marking and sexing techniques are non-invasive thereby supporting the RRR-principle of animal welfare guidelines. © JoVE 2006-2014. All Rights Reserved.},

Among the invasive types, ductal infiltrating carcinoma (DIC) is the most common and aggressive form. Using an in vitro model consisting of a DIC-derived cell line (8701-BC) and a non-tumoral mammary epithelial cell line (HB2), we used the proteomics approach to search for homology and differences in protein expression patterns between tumoral and nontumoral phenotypes. Within an analysis window comprising 1,750 discernible spots we have currently catalogued 140 protein spots of potential interest. Fifty-eight of them were identified by gel matching with reference maps, immunodetection, or N-terminal microsequencing and classified into four functional groups. Twelve proteins were found differentially expressed in two cell lines: four were uniquely present in the neoplastic cell proteome and eight in epithelial cells. In addition, 53 proteins displayed different relative expression levels between the two cell lines, that is, 44 were more elevated in cancer cells and 9 in HB2 cells. Among proteins with greater relative abundance in cancer cells we identified glycolytic enzymes (or their isoforms), which may indicate that the known metabolic dysregulation in cancer can reflect oncogenic-related defects of glycolytic gene expression.},

	abstract = {To understand how researchers are tackling globally important issues, it is crucial to identify whether current research is comprehensive enough to make substantive predictions about general responses.We examined how research on climate change affecting insects is being assessed, what factors are being tested and the localities of studies, from1703 papers published between 1985 and August 2012.Most published research (64%) is generated from Europe and North America and being dedicated to core data analysis, with 29% of the studies analysed dedicated to Lepidoptera and 22% Diptera: which are well above their contribution to the currently identified insect species richness (estimated at 13% and 17% respectively). Research publications on Coleoptera fall well short of their proportional contribution (19% of publications but 39% of insect species identified), and to a lesser extent so do Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera. Species specific responses to changes in temperature by assessing distribution/range shifts or changes in abundance were the most commonly used methods of assessing the impact of climate change on insects. Research on insects and climate change to date is dominated by manuscripts assessing butterflies in Europe, insects of economic and/or environmental concern in forestry, agriculture, and model organisms. The research on understanding how insects will respond to a rapidly changing climate is still in its infancy, but the current trends of publications give a good basis for how we are attempting to assess insect responses. In particular, there is a crucial need for broader studies of ecological, behavioural, physiological and life history responses to be addressed across a greater range of geographic locations, particularly Asia, Africa and Australasia, and in areas of high human population growth and habitat modification. It is still too early in our understanding of taxa responses to climate change to know if charismatic taxa, such as butterflies, or disease vectors, including Diptera, can be used as keystone taxa to generalise other insect responses to climate change. This is critical as the basic biology of most species is still poorly known, and dominant, well studied taxa may show variable responses to climate change across their distribution due to regional biotic and abiotic influences. Indeed identifying if insect responses to climate change can be generalised using phylogeny, functional traits, or functional groups, or will populations and species exhibit idiosyncratic responses, should be a key priority for future research. © 2013 Andrew et al.},

As this connection grows, it becomes even more important to appreciate the mechanisms that create and control the combined effect of these factors. However, we believe one such important set of mechanisms comes from species' behavior and the subsequent trait-mediated interactions, as opposed to the more often studied density-mediated effects. Behavioral mechanisms are already well appreciated for mitigating the separate effects of the environment and species interactions. Thus, they could be at the forefront for understanding the combined effects. In this review, we (1) show some of the known behaviors that influence the individual and combined effects of climate change and species interactions; (2) conceptualize general ways behavior may mediate these combined effects; and (3) illustrate the potential importance of including behavior in our current tools for predicting climate change effects. In doing so, we hope to promote more research on behavior and other mechanistic factors that may increase our ability to accurately predict climate change effects. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {The major goal of the present functional magnetic resonance imaging study was to investigate the influence of disgust sensitivity on hemodynamic responses during disgust induction. Fifteen subjects viewed three different film excerpts (duration: 135 s each) with disgust-evoking, threatening and neutral content. The films were presented in a block design with four repetitions of each condition. Afterwards, subjects gave affective ratings for the films and answered the questionnaire for the assessment of disgust sensitivity (QADS, [Schienle, A., Walter, B., Stark, R., Vaitl, D., 2002b. Ein Fragebogen zur Erfassung der Ekelempfindlichkeit (FEE) [A questionnaire for the assessment of disgust sensitivity, QADS]. Klin. Psychol. Psychother. 31, 110-120]). The subjects' overall disgust sensitivity was positively related to their experienced disgust, as well as to their prefrontal cortex activation during the disgust condition. Further, there was a positive correlation between subjects' scores on the QADS subscale spoilage/decay and their amygdala activation (r = 0.76). This was reasonable since the disgust film clip depicted a cockroach-invasion and the subscale spoilage/decay contains, among others, an item asking for disgust towards cockroaches. The study stresses, in accordance to previous studies, the importance of considering personality traits when studying affective responses in fMRI studies. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In 2011, Big Bend National Park, Texas, USA, experienced the most severe single year drought in its recorded history, resulting in significant plant mortality.We used this event to test how perennial plant response to drought varied across elevation, plant growth form and leaf traits. In October 2010 and October 2011, we measured plant cover by species at six evenly-spaced elevations ranging from Chihuahuan desert (666 m) to oak forest in the Chisos mountains (1,920 m). We asked the following questions: what was the relationship between elevation and stem dieback and did susceptibility to drought differ among functional groups or by leaf traits? In 2010, pre-drought, we measured leaf mass per area (LMA) on each species. In 2011, the percent of canopy dieback for each individual was visually estimated. Living canopy cover decreased significantly after the drought of 2011 and dieback decreased with elevation. There was no relationship between LMA and dieback within elevations. The negative relationship between proportional dieback and elevation was consistent in shrub and succulent species, which were the most common growth forms across elevations, indicating that dieback was largely driven by elevation and not by species traits. Growth formturnover did not influence canopy dieback; differences in canopy cover and proportional dieback among elevations were driven primarily by differences in drought severity. These results indicate that the 2011 drought in Big Bend National Park had a large effect on communities at all elevations with average dieback for all woody plants ranging from8% dieback at the highest elevation to 83% dieback at lowest elevations. © 2014 Waring and Schwilk.},

	abstract = {Around the world, the human-induced collapses of populations and species have triggered a sixth mass extinction crisis, with rare species often being the first to disappear. Although the role of species diversity in the maintenance of ecosystem processes has been widely investigated, the role of rare species remains controversial. A critical issue is whether common species insure against the loss of functions supported by rare species. This issue is even more critical in species-rich ecosystems where high functional redundancy among species is likely and where it is thus often assumed that ecosystem functioning is buffered against species loss. Here, using extensive datasets of species occurrences and functional traits from three highly diverse ecosystems (846 coral reef fishes, 2,979 alpine plants, and 662 tropical trees), we demonstrate that the most distinct combinations of traits are supported predominantly by rare species both in terms of local abundance and regional occupancy. Moreover, species that have low functional redundancy and are likely to support the most vulnerable functions, with no other species carrying similar combinations of traits, are rarer than expected by chance in all three ecosystems. For instance, 63% and 98% of fish species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions in coral reef ecosystems are locally and regionally rare, respectively. For alpine plants, 32% and 89% of such species are locally and regionally rare, respectively. Remarkably, 47% of fish species and 55% of tropical tree species that are likely to support highly vulnerable functions have only one individual per sample on average. Our results emphasize the importance of rare species conservation, even in highly diverse ecosystems, which are thought to exhibit high functional redundancy. Rare species offer more than aesthetic, cultural, or taxonomic diversity value; they disproportionately increase the potential breadth of functions provided by ecosystems across spatial scales. As such, they are likely to insure against future uncertainty arising from climate change and the ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures on ecosystems. Our results call for a more detailed understanding of the role of rarity and functional vulnerability in ecosystem functioning. © 2013 Mouillot et al.},

	abstract = {Determinants of daytime sleepiness include sleep length, sleep continuity, and circadian factors. Sleep stage composition has not been seen as influencing subsequent daytime functioning; however, earlier studies did not focus explicitly on sleepiness. The present experiment studied the effects of selective sleep‐stage restriction on an objective measure of sleep tendency, and explored the relationship between sleepiness and subsequent REM recurrence during REM deprivation. Daytime sleep latency was measured by a modified Multiple Sleep Latency Test prior to and following two nights of awakenings from either REM or Stage 2 sleep in 16 normal young adults. Sleep latency following these awakenings was also measured. REM sleep and Stage 2 awakenings produced comparable levels of sleepiness, both during the Awakening Nights and subsequent daytime Multiple Sleep Latency Testing. Pooling the groups, daytime and nocturnal sleepiness measures were correlated within individuals. In the REM‐Awakening Group, Pre‐Awakening daytime sleepiness was associated with the tendency for REM sleep to recur following experimental awakenings. Comparable levels of sleepiness may result from nonspecific processes such as sleep curtailment and fragmentation, or alternatively from separate REM and Stage 2 mechanisms. The relationship between REM sleep and sleepiness is discussed in the context of both state and trait models. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Temporal and spatial trends have been documented at large spatial scales, but few studies have examined more localized patterns of spatiotemporal variation, by species or functional group. In this paper, we apply spatial occupancy models to assess the spatial patchiness and interannual trends of 18 seabird species in the Puget Sound region (Washington State, USA). Our dataset, the Puget Sound Seabird Survey of the Seattle Audubon Society, is unique in that it represents a seven-year study, collected with a focus on winter months (October-April). Despite historic declines of seabirds in the region over the last 50 years, results from our study are optimistic, suggesting increases in probabilities of occurrence for 14 of the 18 species included. We found support for declines in occurrence for white-winged scoters, brants, and 2 species of grebes. The decline ofWestern grebes in particular is troubling, but in agreement with other recent studies that have shown support for a range shift south in recent years, to the southern end of California Current. © 2015 Ward et al.},

	abstract = {Agricultural intensification is implicated as a major driver of global biodiversity loss. Local management and landscape scale factors both influence biodiversity in agricultural systems, but there are relatively few studies to date looking at how local and landscape scales influence biodiversity in tropical agroecosystems. Understanding what drives the diversity of groups of organisms such as spiders is important from a pragmatic point of view because of the important biocontrol services they offer to agriculture. Spiders in coffee are somewhat enigmatic because of their positive or lack of response to agricultural intensification. In this study, we provide the first analysis, to our knowledge, of the arboreal spiders in the shade trees of coffee plantations. In the Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico we sampled across 38 sites on 9 coffee plantations. Tree and canopy connectedness were found to positively influence overall arboreal spider richness and abundance. We found that different functional groups of spiders are responding to different local and landscape factors, but overall elevation was most important variable influencing arboreal spider diversity. Our study has practical management applications that suggest having shade grown coffee offers more suitable habitat for arboreal spiders due to a variety of the characteristics of the shade trees. Our results which show consistently more diverse arboreal spider communities in lower elevations are important in light of looming global climate change. As the range of suitable elevations for coffee cultivation shrinks promoting arboreal spider diversity will be important in sustaining the viability of coffee. © 2014 Hajian-Forooshani et al.},

	abstract = {Habitat complexity is a major determinant of structure and diversity of ant assemblages. Following the size-grain hypothesis, smaller ant species are likely to be advantaged in more complex habitats compared to larger species.Habitat complexity can act as an environmental filter based on species size and morphological traits, therefore affecting the overall structure and diversity of ant assemblages. In natural and semi-natural ecosystems, habitat complexity is principally regulated by ecological successions or disturbance such as fire and grazing. Urban ecosystems provide an opportunity to test relationships between habitat, ant assemblage structure and ant traits using novel combinations of habitat complexity generated and sustained by human management. We sampled ant assemblages in low-complexity and high-complexity parks, and high-complexity woodland remnants, hypothesizing that (i) ant abundance and species richness would be higher in high-complexity urban habitats, (ii) ant assemblages would differ between low- and high-complexity habitats and (iii) ants living in high-complexity habitats would be smaller than those living in low-complexity habitats. Contrary to our hypothesis, ant species richness was higher in low-complexity habitats compared to high-complexity habitats. Overall, ant assemblages were significantly different among the habitat complexity types investigated, although ant size and morphology remained the same. Habitat complexity appears to affect the structure of ant assemblages in urban ecosystems as previously observed in natural and semi-natural ecosystems. However, the habitat complexity filter does not seem to be linked to ant morphological traits related to body size. ï¿½ 2015 Ossola et al.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection theory models evolution of sexual signals and preferences using simple life histories. However, life-history models predict that males benefit from increasing sexual investment approaching old age, producing age-dependent sexual traits. Age-dependent traits require time and energy to grow, and will not fully mature before individuals enter mating competition. Early evolutionary stages pose several problems for these traits. Age-dependent traits suffer from strong viability selection and gain little benefit from mate choice when rare. Few males will grow large traits, and they will rarely encounter choosy females. The evolutionary origins of age-dependent traits therefore remain unclear. I used numerical simulations to analyze evolution of preferences, condition (viability) and traits in an age-structured population. Traits in the model depended on age and condition ("good genes") in a population with no genetic drift. I asked (1) if age-dependent indicator traits and their preferences can originate depending on the strength of selection and the size of the trait; (2) which mode of development (age-dependent versus age-independent) eventually predominates when both modes occur in the population; and (3) if age-independent traits can invade a population with agedependent traits. Age-dependent traits evolve under weaker selection and at smaller sizes than age-independent traits. This result held in isolation and when the types co-occur. Evolution of age-independent traits depends only on trait size, whereas evolution of age-dependent traits depends on both strength of selection and growth rate. Invasion of age-independence into populations with established traits followed a similar pattern with age-dependence predominating at small trait sizes. I suggest that reduced adult mortality facilitates sexual selection by favoring the evolution of age-dependent sexual signals under weak selection. © 2013 Adamson.},

It is clear that a complex interplay between the host, bacteria and bacterial genes is implicated in the development of these intestinal diseases. Understanding the basic elements of these interactions could have important implications for disease detection and management. Recent studies have revealed that E. coli utilizes a complex arsenal of virulence factors to colonize and persist in the intestine. Some of these virulence factors, such as the genotoxin colibactin, were found to promote colorectal cancer in experimental models. In this Review, we summarize key features of the dysbiotic states associated with chronic intestinal inflammation and colorectal cancer, and discuss how the dysregulated interplay between host and bacteria could favor the emergence of E. coli with pathological traits implicated in these pathologies. © 2014, Company of Biologists Ltd.

Extracellular activity was recorded from neurons in premotor and prefrontal areas with an array of six microelectrodes. An algorithm was developed to detect PFSs, defined as a set of three spikes and two intervals with a precision of ±1 ms repeating significantly more than expected by chance. The expected level of repetition was computed based on the firing rate and the pairwise correlation of the participating units, assuming a Poisson distribution of event counts. Accordingly, the search for PFSs was corrected for rate modulations. PFSs were found in 24/25 recording sessions. Most PFSs (76%) were composed of spikes of more than one unit but usually not more than two units (67%). The PFSs spanned hundreds of milliseconds, and the average interval between two events within the PFSs was 200 ms. No traces of periodic oscillations were found in the PFS intervals. The bins of the matrix that were defined as PFSs were isolated temporally: the spikes that generated PFSs were not associated with high-frequency bursts or rapid coherent rate fluctuations. A given PFS tended to be correlated with the animal's behavior. Furthermore, for 19% of the PFS pairs that shared the same unit composition, each member of the pair was associated with a different type of behavior. The PFSs often appeared in clusters that were associated with particular phases of the behavior. The firing rate of single units did not provide a full explanation for the timing and structure of these clusters. A reduced spike train (RST) was defined for each unit by taking all spikes of that unit that were part of any PFS. In 88% of the cases the degree of modulation of the RST was higher than that of the complete spike train. The results suggest that relevant information is carried by the fine temporal structure of cortical activity. A coding scheme that involves such temporal structures is rich and sufficiently flexible to facilitate a rapid organization of cortical neurons into functional groups. The results can be accounted for by the synfire chain model, which suggests that cortical activity is mediated by synchronous activation of neural groups in a reverberatory mode.},

	abstract = {Anguillicola crassus is a swim bladder nematode of eels. The parasite is native to the Asian eel Anguilla japonica, but was introduced to Europe and the European eel Anguilla anguilla in the early 1980s. A Taiwanese source has been proposed for this introduction. In the new host in the recipient area, the parasite appears to be more pathogenic. As a reason for these differences, genetically fixed differences in infectivity and development between Taiwanese and European A.crassus have been described and disentangled fromplasticity induced by different host environments. To explore whether transcriptional regulation is involved in these lifecycle differences, we have analysed a "common garden", cross infection experiment, using deep-sequencing transcriptomics. Surprisingly, in the face of clear phenotypic differences in life history traits, we identified no significant differences in gene expression between parasite populations or between experimental host species. From 120,000 SNPs identified in the transcriptome data we found that European A. crassus were not a genetic subset of the Taiwanese nematodes sampled. The loci that have the major contribution to the European-Taiwanese population differentiation show an enrichment of synonymous and non-coding polymorphism. This argues against positive selection in population differentiation. However, genes involved in protein processing in the endoplasmatic reticulum membrane and genes bearing secretion signal sequences were enriched in the set of genes most differentiated between European and Taiwanese A. crassus. These genes could be a source for the phenotypically visible genetically fixed differences between European and Taiwanese A. crassus. © 2014 Heitlinger et al.},

We analyzed changes in migration phenology and biometrics of three closely-related long-distance migrant Acrocephalus species. We used the records of 12 063 Sedge, 12 913 Reed, and 5 409 Marsh Warblers caught and ringed between 1989-2009, at a Hungarian stopover site. Quantile regressions were used to analyse the changes in spring and autumn migration phenology. Median spring arrival date of Sedge and Reed Warblers shifted 6.5 and 7.5 days earlier, respectively. Autumn arrival of all species shifted one (Reed and Marsh Warblers) or two (Sedge Warbler) weeks later. Mean body mass of adult Reed and Marsh Warblers decreased in spring (by 0.3 and 0.2 grams, respectively) and in autumn (by 0.8 and 0.2 grams, respectively) while body mass of adult Sedge Warblers decreased only in autumn (by 0.4 grams). Mean wing length of all species increased significantly (range of change: 0.6-1 mm). Despite the fact that the studied species are closely related, all three have remarkably different migration strategies. However, similar patterns can be observed in the studied parameters, indicating that global processes may have general effects on these species, albeit through markedly different mechanisms. © 2011 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

The evolution of the timing of reproduction in this modeling framework has already been studied earlier in the case of equilibrium resident dynamics, but we generalize the situation to also fluctuating population dynamics. We find that, as in the equilibrium case, the presence or absence of inter-juvenile aggression affects the functional form of the evolutionarily stable reproductive strategy. If an ESS exists, it can have an absolutely continuous part only if inter-juvenile aggression is included in the model. If inter-juvenile aggression is not included in the model, an ESS can have no continuous parts, and only Dirac measures are possible. © 2010 Society for Mathematical Biology.},

	abstract = {Highland natives show unique breathing patterns and ventilatory responses at altitude, both at rest and during exercise. For many ventilatory traits, there is also significant variation between highland native groups, including indigenous populations in the Andes and Himalaya, and more recent altitude arrivals in places like Colorado. This review summarizes the literature in this area with some focus on partitioning putative population genetic differences from differences acquired through lifelong exposure to hypoxia. Current studies suggest that Tibetans have high resting ventilation (over(V, ̇)E), and a high hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), similar to altitude acclimatized lowlanders. Andeans, in contrast, show low resting over(V, ̇)E and a low or "blunted" HVR, with little evidence that these traits are acquired via lifelong exposure. Resting over(V, ̇)E of non-indigenous altitude natives is not well documented, but lifelong hypoxic exposure almost certainly blunts HVR in these groups through decreased chemosensitivity to hypoxia in a process known as hypoxic desensitization (HD). Together, these studies suggest that the time course of ventilatory response, and in particular the origin or absence of HD, depends on population genetic background i.e., the allele or haplotype frequencies that characterize a particular population. During exercise, altitude natives have lower over(V, ̇)E compared to acclimatized lowland controls. Altitude natives also have smaller alveolar-arterial partial pressure differences PAO2 - P aO2 during exercise suggesting differences in gas exchange efficiency. Small PAO2 - P aO2 in highland natives of Colorado underscores the likely importance of developmental adaptation to hypoxia affecting structural/functional aspects of gas exchange with resultant changes in breathing pattern. However, in Andeans, at least, there is also evidence that low exercise over(V, ̇)E is determined by genetic background affecting ventilatory control independent of gas exchange. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the effects of gene, environment, and gene-environment interaction on these traits, and these effects are likely to differ widely between altitude native populations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Criteria for selecting traits were that they could be applied to most taxa, were easily available, and their inclusion would result in new research and/or management applications. Numerical traits were favoured over categorical. Habitat was excluded as it can be derived from a selection of these traits. Ten traits were prioritized for inclusion in the most comprehensive open access database on marine species (World Register of Marine Species), namely taxonomic classification, environment, geography, depth, substratum, mobility, skeleton, diet, body size and reproduction.

Four levels of osmotic stress (-0.4, -0.6, -0.8 and -1.0 MPa) were created and performances were monitored against a control. Physiological and biochemical stress determining parameters such as malondialdechyde (MDA), proline content, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were compared between seedlings of both genotypes. The results indicated that both genotypes have similar responses at four osmotic potentials for all traits studied. All seedling growth parameters such as germination percentage, root length, shoot length, root and shoot dry weight decreased with increasing osmotic stress. MDA, proline, and H2O2 were found to be increased at different osmotic gradients in comparison to control. Cultivar 1114 was less affected than the interspecific line under these stress conditions. The data observed in the experiments revealed that perennial wild H. mollis can hardly be considered to be an excellent candidate of drought tolerance genes. © 2014 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	abstract = {The widespread invasion of the nonmycorrhizal biennial plant, Alliaria petiolata in North America is hypothesized to be facilitated by the production of novel biochemical weapons that suppress the growth of mycorrhizal fungi. As a result, A. petiolata is expected to be a strong competitor against plant species that rely on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake services. If A. petiolata is also a strong competitor for soil resources, it should deplete nutrients to levels lower than can be tolerated by weaker competitors. Because the negative effect of losing the fungal symbiont for mycorrhizal plants is greatest when nutrients are low, the ability of A. petiolata to simultaneously suppress fungi and efficiently take up soil nutrients should further strengthen its competitive ability against mycorrhizal plants. To test this hypothesis, we grew 27mycorrhizal tree, forb and grass species that are representative of invaded habitats in the absence or presence of competition with A. petiolata in soils that had previously been experimentally planted with the invader or left as a control. A history of A. petiolata in soil reduced plant available forms of nitrogen by >50% and phosphorus by 17% relative to control soil. Averagemycorrhizal colonization of competitor species was reduced by >50% in A. petiolata history versus control soil. Contrary to expectations, competition between A. petiolata and other species was stronger in control than history soil. The invader suppressed the biomass of 70% of competitor species in control soil but only 26% of species in history soil. In addition, A. petiolata biomass was reduced by 56% in history versus control soil, whereas the average biomass of competitor species was reduced by 15%. Thus, our results suggest that the negative effect of nutrient depletion on A. petiolata was stronger than the negative effect of suppressingmycorrhizal colonization on competitor species. These findings indicate that the inhibitory potential of A. petiolata on competitor species viamycorrhizal suppression is not enhanced under nutrient limitation. © 2015 Poon and Maherali.},

	abstract = {Formalin fixation, the chemical process in which formaldehyde binds to cells and tissues, is widely used to preserve human brain specimens from autolytic decomposition [10,16,25,41]. Ultrastructure of cellular and mitochondrial membranes is markedly altered by vesiculation [16], but this does not interfere with diagnostic evaluation of neurohistology by light microscopy. Serious difficulties are encountered, however, when immunocytochemical staining is attempted. Antigens that are immunoreactive in unfixed frozen sections and protein extracts appear to be concealed or destroyed in formalin-fixed tissues. In dilute aqueous solution, formaldehyde is in equilibrium with methylene glycol and its polymeric hydrates, the balance by far in favor of methylene glycol [16,41]. Carbonylic formaldehyde is a reactive electrophilic species well known for crosslinking functional groups in tissue proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides [16-20,22,27]. Some of its methylene crosslinks are readily hydrolyzed. Others are stable and irreversible. During immunostaining reactions, intra- and inter-molecular links between macromolecules limit antibody permeation of tissue sections [16], alter protein secondary structure [26,34], and reduce accessibility of antigenic determinants [10]. Accordingly, immunoreactivity is diminished for many antigens. Tissues are rapidly penetrated by methylene glycol, but formaldehyde binding to cellular constituents is relatively slow, increasing progressively until equilibrium is reached [16,24]. In addition, prolonged storage in formalin may result in acidification of human brain specimens [42]. Low pH favors dissociation of methylene glycol into formaldehyde [16], further reducing both classical staining and antigen detectability [14,42]. Various procedures have been devised to counter the antigen masking effects of formaldehyde. Examples include pretreatment of tissue sections with proteases [2,7,23], formic acid [3,28], or ultrasound [43]. Recently, heating of mounted sections in ionic salt solution by microwave energy was found to restore many antigens [6,37,44-48,54-56]. Theory and practice of microwave antigen retrieval are covered extensively in the handbook Microwave Cookbook for Microscopists [29]. A concise overview of microwave methods in the neurosciences has been published [33], and clinical applications have been reviewed [30]. In this context, it should be noted that fresh tissues may be stabilized for immunocytochemistry by reversible, non-chemical binding processes such as cryosectioning after microwave treatment [32] and freeze- drying [52]. Thus, it may be possible to enhance immunostaining for some antigens by microwave irradiation of unfixed as well as fixed specimens. Parameters to be optimized for microwave retrieval of specific antigens include temperature, irradiation time, tissue buffer composition, salt concentration, and pH [12,47,53]. Temperature, irradiation time, and pH are key variables [12,13]. With this in mind, an optimal method was developed for retrieval of a wide variety of antigens in human brain tissues [14]. Typical microwave protocols employ elevated temperatures that may reach 100°C, where denaturation causes irreversible uncoiling and disruption of protein secondary and tertiary structures [11]. Under these conditions, stable covalent bonds securing methylene crosslinks between polypeptides remain intact [20], but more reactive links formed by Schiff bases may be hydrolyzed [45]. Resultant conformational changes presumably expose buried loops of continuous amino acids and protruding regions [1], increasing accessibility of their epitopes [51]. Protein denaturation seems to be a reasonable explanation for the effects of microwaves on antigen retrieval. This idea is supported by the observation that denaturing solutions such as 6 M urea increase immunoreactivity of some antigens [8]. Still, the molecular basis of these effects remains unresolved, in part due to the complex chemistry of formaldehyde reactions with tissue constituents [41]. Indeed, some methylene bridges between similar groups such as NH2 and NH may be hydrolyzed by washing fixed tissues in distilled water at ambient temperature for several weeks [24,41]. Moreover, denaturation by conventional heating enhances antigenieity as well as classical neuroanatomical staining of formalin-fixed tissue [15,39,40,49]. When such externally heated specimens are immunostained and viewed by light microscopy, the results are almost indistinguishable from those obtained by microwave irradiation [58]. Nevertheless, the current widespread use of microwave methods in clinical and basic science laboratories likely results from the speed, convenience, and reproducibility of the results. Loss of immunoreactivity for many antigens likewise may occur when tissues are dehydrated in alcohol before they are embedded in paraffin. Exposure to alcohol causes antigenic denaturation, but clearing in xylene and heating in liquid paraffin do not [52]. While there are numerous reports of microwave procedures for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues [6,8,9,35,36,38,44,45,48,57,60], alternative methods that would further extend the range of retrievable epitopes have received less attention. One simple approach may be to irradiate free-floating sections with microwaves. A previous study found that heating vibratome sections in solution with microwaves resulted in severe wrinkling of the tissues. This problem was avoided by irradiation of tissue slices in buffer prior to sectioning [13]. Another strategy is presented here for neuropathological studies of human brain [50]. Vibratome sections in isotonic, mildly acidic citrate buffer [6,55] are heated to the boiling point with microwaves. After brief denaturation at 100°C, the sections are simmered for 5 min. To remove wrinkles, sections are incubated subsequently in Tris-buffered saline containing serum proteins and non-ionic detergent. The method also is suitable for single- and double-labeling studies of neural antigens in formalin-fixed tissues from experimental animals.},

	abstract = {Gene drives may be capable of addressing ecological problems by altering entire populations of wild organisms, but their use has remained largely theoretical due to technical constraints. Here we consider the potential for RNA-guided gene drives based on the CRISPR nuclease Cas9 to serve as a general method for spreading altered traits through wild populations over many generations. We detail likely capabilities, discuss limitations, and provide novel precautionary strategies to control the spread of gene drives and reverse genomic changes. The ability to edit populations of sexual species would offer substantial benefits to humanity and the environment. For example, RNA-guided gene drives could potentially prevent the spread of disease, support agriculture by reversing pesticide and herbicide resistance in insects and weeds, and control damaging invasive species. However, the possibility of unwanted ecological effects and near-certainty of spread across political borders demand careful assessment of each potential application. We call for thoughtful, inclusive, and well-informed public discussions to explore the responsible use of this currently theoretical technology. © Esvelt et al.},

	abstract = {Temperature is the most significant factor controlling developmental timing of most temperate poikilotherms. In the face of climate change, a crucial question is how will poikilothermic organisms evolve when faced with changing thermal environments? In this paper, we integrate models for developmental timing and quantitative genetics. A simple model for determining developmental milestones (emergence times, egg hatch) is introduced, and the general quantitative genetic recursion for the mean value of developmental parameters presented. Evolutionary steps proportional to the difference between current median parameters and parameters currently selected for depend on the fitness, which is assumed to depend on emergence density. Asymptotic states of the joint model are determined, which turn out to be neutrally stable (marginal) fixed points in the developmental model by itself, and an associated stable emergence distribution is also described. An asymptotic convergence analysis is presented for idealized circumstances, indicating basic stability criteria. Numerical studies show that the stability analysis is quite conservative, with basins of attraction to the asymptotic states that are much larger than expected. It is shown that frequency-dependent selection drives oscillatory dynamics and that the asymptotic states balance the asymmetry of the emergence distribution and the fitness function. © 2010 Society for Mathematical Biology.},

	abstract = {We have used the identified cells of the Drosophila Giant Fiber System (GFS) to study the defects induced by the temperature‐sensitive paralytic mutations no action potential (nap) and paralytic (para). These mutations paralyze at elevated temperatures, reported as due to a block of action potential propagation. We found, however, that the cells of the GFS still were able to respond to stimuli at 7–10°C above the temperature causing mutant paralysis. Stimulus threshold and conduction time both decrease with increasing temperature in the mutants in a manner indistinguishable from wild‐type. Since action potentials can propagate efficiently in the mutants at elevated temperatures, we looked for other neural defects that might be involved in producing paralysis. We did find reduced neuronal function at sites such as electrical synapses and axonal branch points where current may be limiting. These sites had weakened following frequency, occasional failures, and increased conduction times. We believe the non‐temperature‐dependent defects in nap and para uncover the normally temperature‐sensitive traits latent within all neurons. Increasing temperature increases the rates of channel activation and inactivation. At higher temperatures, Na+ inactivation and K+ activation encroach upon the Na+‐activation time, reducing inward sodium current. In addition to this normal temperature‐dependent effect, the mutations decrease the number of sodium channels in neurons in a non‐temperature‐dependent manner. These two reductions in sodium current combine to prevent spiking threshold from being reached at current limited sites. The temperature at which a sufficient number of these sites block should be the temperature of paralysis. Copyright © 1990 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

To this aim we calculated alpha and beta TD, PD, and FD for 349 ant communities, which included a total of 155 ant species; we examined 10 functional traits and phylogenetic relatedness. Variation partitioning was used to examine how much variation in ant diversity was explained by environmental and spatial variables. Autocorrelation in diversity measures and each trait's phylogenetic signal were also analyzed.We found strong autocorrelation in diversity measures. Both environmental and spatial variables significantly contributed to variation in TD, PD, and FD at both alpha and beta scales; spatial structure had the larger influence. The different facets of diversity showed similar patterns along environmental gradients. Environment explained a much larger percentage of variation in FD than in TD or PD. All traits demonstrated strong phylogenetic signals. Our results indicate that environmental filtering and dispersal limitations structure all types of diversity in ant communities. Strong dispersal limitations appear to have led to clustering of TD, PD, and FD in western and central Europe, probably because different historical and evolutionary processes generated different pools of species. Remarkably, these three facets of diversity showed parallel patterns along environmental gradients. Trait-mediated species sorting and niche conservatism appear to structure ant diversity, as evidenced by the fact that more variation was explained for FD and that all traits had strong phylogenetic signals. Since environmental variables explained much more variation in FD than in PD, functional diversity should be a better indicator of community assembly processes than phylogenetic diversity. © 2015 Arnan et al.},

	abstract = {Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in haematological malignancy patients and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients(1). Detection of IPA represents a formidable diagnostic challenge and, in the absence of a 'gold standard', relies on a combination of clinical data and microbiology and histopathology where feasible. Diagnosis of IPA must conform to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycology Study Group (EORTC/MSG) consensus defining "proven", "probable", and "possible" invasive fungal diseases(2). Currently, no nucleic acid-based tests have been externally validated for IPA detection and so polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is not included in current EORTC/MSG diagnostic criteria. Identification of Aspergillus in histological sections is problematic because of similarities in hyphal morphologies with other invasive fungal pathogens(3), and proven identification requires isolation of the etiologic agent in pure culture. Culture-based approaches rely on the availability of biopsy samples, but these are not always accessible in sick patients, and do not always yield viable propagules for culture when obtained. An important feature in the pathogenesis of Aspergillus is angio-invasion, a trait that provides opportunities to track the fungus immunologically using tests that detect characteristic antigenic signatures molecules in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. This has led to the development of the Platelia enzyme immunoassay (GM-EIA) that detects Aspergillus galactomannan and a 'pan-fungal' assay (Fungitell test) that detects the conserved fungal cell wall component (1 →3)-β-D-glucan, but not in the mucorales that lack this component in their cell walls(1,4). Issues surrounding the accuracy of these tests(1,4-6) has led to the recent development of next-generation monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based assays that detect surrogate markers of infection(1,5). Thornton(5) recently described the generation of an Aspergillus-specific MAb (JF5) using hybridoma technology and its use to develop an immuno-chromatographic lateral-flow device (LFD) for the point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of IPA. A major advantage of the LFD is its ability to detect activity since MAb JF5 binds to an extracellular glycoprotein antigen that is secreted during active growth of the fungus only(5). This is an important consideration when using fluids such as lung BAL for diagnosing IPA since Aspergillus spores are a common component of inhaled air. The utility of the device in diagnosing IPA has been demonstrated using an animal model of infection, where the LFD displayed improved sensitivity and specificity compared to the Platelia GM and Fungitell (1 → 3)-β-D-glucan assays(7). Here, we present a simple LFD procedure to detect Aspergillus antigen in human serum and BAL fluids. Its speed and accuracy provides a novel adjunct point-of-care test for diagnosis of IPA in haematological malignancy patients.},

	abstract = {Sex and environment may dramatically affect genetic studies, and thus should be carefully considered. Beginning with two inbred mouse strains with contrasting phenotype in the neuroma model of neuropathic pain (autotomy), we established a backcross population on which we conducted a genome-wide scan. The backcross population was partially maintained in small social groups and partially in isolation. The genome scan detected one previously reported quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 15 (pain1), but no additional QTLs were found. Interestingly, group caging introduced phenotypic noise large enough to completely mask the genetic effect of the chromosome 15 QTL. The reason appears to be that group-caging animals from the low-autotomy strain together with animals from the high-autotomy strain dramatically increases autotomy in the otherwise low-autotomy mice (males or females). The converse, suppression of pain behaviour in the high-autotomy strain when caged with the low-autotomy strain was also observed, but only in females. Even in isolated mice, the genetic effect of the chromosome 15 QTL was significant only in females. To determine why, we evaluated autotomy levels of females in 12 different inbred stains of mice and compared them to previously reported levels for males. Strikingly larger environmental variation was observed in males than in females for this pain phenotype. The high baseline variance in males can explain the difficulty in detecting the genetic effect, which was readily seen in females. Our study emphasizes the importance of sex and environment in the genetic analysis of pain. © The Authors (2007).},

	abstract = {Species traits may provide a short-cut to predicting generalities in species turnover in response to environmental change, particularly for poorly known taxa. We ask if morphological traits of assemblages respond predictably to macrohabitats across a large scale. Ant assemblages were collected at nine paired pasture and remnant sites from within three areas along a 300 km distance.We measured ten functional morphological traits for replicate individuals of each species.We used a fourth corner model to test associations between microhabitat variables, macrohabitats (pastures and remnants) and traits. In addition, we tested the phylogenetic independence of traits, to determine if responses were likely to be due to filtering by morphology or phylogeny. Nine of ten traits were predicted by macrohabitat and the majority of these traits were independent of phylogeny. Surprisingly, microhabitat variables were not associated with morphological traits. Traits which were associated with macrohabitats were involved in locomotion, feeding behaviour and sensory ability. Ants in remnants had more maxillary palp segments, longer scapes and wider eyes, while having shorter femurs, smaller apical mandibular teeth and shorterWeber's lengths. A clear relationship between traits and macrohabitats across a large scale suggests that species are filtered by coarse environmental differences. In contrast to the findings of previous studies, fine-scale filtering of morphological traits was not apparent. If such generalities in morphological trait responses to habitat hold across even larger scales, traits may prove critical in predicting the response of species assemblages to global change.© 2014 Yates et al.},

	abstract = {Global change drivers create new environmental scenarios and selective pressures, affecting plant species in various interacting ways. Plants respond with changes in phenology, physiology, and reproduction, with consequences for biotic interactions and community composition. We review information on phenotypic plasticity, a primary means by which plants cope with global change scenarios, recommending promising approaches for investigating the evolution of plasticity and describing constraints to its evolution. We discuss the important but largely ignored role of phenotypic plasticity in range shifts and review the extensive literature on invasive species as models of evolutionary change in novel environments. Plasticity can play a role both in the short-term response of plant populations to global change as well as in their long-term fate through the maintenance of genetic variation. In new environmental conditions, plasticity of certain functional traits may be beneficial (i.e., the plastic response is accompanied by a fitness advantage) and thus selected for. Plasticity can also be relevant in the establishment and persistence of plants in novel environments that are crucial for populations at the colonizing edge in range shifts induced by climate change. Experimental studies show taxonomically widespread plastic responses to global change drivers in many functional traits, though there is a lack of empirical support for many theoretical models on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Future studies should assess the adaptive value and evolutionary potential of plasticity under complex, realistic global change scenarios. Promising tools include resurrection protocols and artificial selection experiments. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Rapid human population growth and habitat modification in the western United States has led to the formation of urban and exurban rangelands. Many of these rangelands are also home to populations of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Our study aimed to compare the vegetation composition of an urban and exurban rangeland, and explore the role that prairie dogs play in these systems. The percent absolute canopy cover of graminoids (grasses and grass-likes), forbs, shrubs, litter, and bare ground were estimated at sampling areas located on and off prairie dog colonies at an urban and an exurban site. Herbaceous forage quality and quantity were determined on plant material collected fromexclosure cages located on the colony during the entire growing season, while a relative estimate of prairie dog density was calculated using maximum counts. The exurban site had more litter and plant cover and less bare ground than the urban site. Graminoids were the dominant vegetation at the exurban plots. In contrast, mostly introduced forbs were found on the urban prairie dog colony. However, the forage quality and quantity tests demonstrated no difference between the two colonies. The relative prairie dog density was greater at the urban colony, which has the potential to drive greater vegetation utilization and reduced cover. Exurban rangeland showed lower levels of impact and retained all of the plant functional groups both on- and off-colony. These results suggest that activities of prairie dogs might further exacerbate the impacts of humans in fragmented urban rangeland habitats. Greater understanding of the drivers of these impacts and the spatial scales at which they occur are likely to prove valuable in the management and conservation of rangelands in and around urban areas. © 2015 Hopson et al.},

	abstract = {The investigation of the neural basis and evolution of language abilities is best pursued as a search for language adaptations rather than as a search for the language faculty. The species uniqueness of language functions is contrasted with the conserved homologies linking human brain structures to anthropoid primate brain structures, and the failure to find species-specific neuroanatomical or genetic correlates of linguistically defined innate features of language (e.g., universal grammar). Comparisons to animal call systems demonstrate minimal anatomical overlap with language systems besides final output nuclei though molos control parallels, the anatomical substrates of gestural behavior, suggesting that language evolution did not proceed by progressive elaboration from nonhuman vocal communication. Although there are no unambiguus gross neuroanatomical dishomologies distinguishing human brains that would suggest a role in language processing, there are clear allometric deviations of quantitative traits, including both gross brain size and deviant scaling of internal structural relationships in human brains, that suggest plausible roles in language processing. Evidence of correlated changes in patterns of axonal connections also implicate the extensive allometric deviations of human brains with language adaptations. One of the most likely correlates of allometrically related connection change related to language evolution involves the existence of direct cortical projections to the nucleus ambiguous (the laryngeal control nucleus of the brainstem), which are likely absent in other mammals. This enables humans to have articulate control over the visceromotor lung and larynx control systems and to couple this with articulate control of the skeletal motor tongue, facial, and jaw muscles. Tracer studies and physiological recording studies of the macaque monkey ventral premotor and prefrontal cortex provide evidence of extensive homology of connectivity, suggesting that the circuits associated with these cortical areas were recruited for language processing during human evolution. Also, cells in adjacent macaque premotor cortex differentially fire with respect to self-initiated and other-initiated grasping behaviors. This suggests that the human homologue to this or nearby areas might be relevant to the mimicry necessary to acquire language. Genetic studies of human language adaptations have identified a gene, FOXP2, that is damaged in an inherited language deficit that affects automatizion of speech and syntactic processes. It turns out to be a highly conserved gene regulating forebrain basal ganglia development in embryogenesis. The human version of the gene contains two unique point mutations, neither of which is implicated in the language disorder. The functional differences produced by these changes are not known, but appear to have spread quickly in the early human population. The homologues to this gene in other species also play roles in vocal behavior. This genetic change is probably only one of a great many that contribute to the adaptation for language. These sources of comparative functional and anatomical information argue against saltationist scenarios that hypothesize a sudden recent appearance of language abilities, and instead suggest that many diverse adaptations converged to make language possible. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) elicited expression of the motor pattern that drives coordinated swimmeret beating in crayfish and modulated this pattern in a dose-dependent manner. In each ganglion that innervates swimmerets, neurons with CCAP-like immunoreactivity sent processes to the lateral neuropils, which contain branches of swimmeret motor neurons and the local pattern-generating circuits. CCAP affected each of the four functional groups of motor neurons, power-stroke excitors (PSE), return-stroke excitors (RSE), power-stroke inhibitors (PSI), and return-stroke inhibitors (RSI), that innervate each swimmeret. When CCAP was superfused, the membrane potentials of these neurons began to oscillate periodically about their mean potentials. The mean potentials of PSE and RSI neurons depolarized, and some of these neurons began to fire during each depolarization. Both intensity and durations of PSE bursts increased significantly. The mean potentials of RSE and PSI neurons hyperpolarized, and these neurons were less likely to fire during each depolarization. When CCAP was superfused in a low Ca2+ saline that blocked chemical transmission, these changes in mean potential persisted, but the periodic oscillations disappeared. These results are evidence that CCAP acts at two levels: activation of local premotor circuits and direct modulation of swimmeret motor neurons. The action on motor neurons is differential; PSEs and RSIs are excited, but RSEs and PSIs are inhibited. The consequences of this selectivity are to increase intensity of bursts of impulses that excite power-stroke muscles.},

Early seedling growth was evaluated on the basis of the length of the root and leaf at the 6th day of the experiment. QTLs were identified by composite interval mapping method using Windows QTLCartographer 2.5 software. For the traits studied, a total of thirty eight additive QTLs were identified. Seventeen QTLs were mapped in C on chromosomes: 1A, 2A, 7A, 1B, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 2D, 3D, 4D and 6D, while twenty one QTLs were identified in SDr on chromosomes: 1A, 2A, 5A, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7B, 3D, 5D and 6D. Most of the QTLs for GP and early leaf growth parameters were clustered on chromosome 4B (associated with the Rht-B1 marker) both in C and SDr plants.

	abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons fire irregularly, with interspersed clusters of high-frequency spikes, commonly called 'bursts'. In this review we examine such heterogeneity in activity, and provide insight into how it can participate in psychiatric conditions such as drug addiction. We first describe several techniques used to evaluate dopamine neuron activity, and comment on the different measures that each provides. We next describe the activity of dopamine neurons in 'basal' conditions. Specifically, we discuss how the use of anesthesia and reduced preparations may alter aspects of dopamine cell activity, and how there is heterogeneity across species and regions. We also describe how dopamine cell firing changes throughout the peri-adolescent period and how dopamine neuron activity differs across the population. In the final section, we discuss how dopamine neuron activity changes in response to life events. First, we focus attention on drugs of abuse. Drugs themselves change firing activity through a variety of mechanisms, with effects on firing while drug is present differing from those seen after drug discontinuation. We then review how stimuli that are rewarding, aversive, or salient can evoke changes in firing rate and discharge pattern of dopamine neurons, and provide behavioral relevance of dopamine signaling. Finally, we discuss how stress can modulate dopamine neuron firing and how this may contribute to the role that stressful experiences play in psychiatric disorders such as addiction and depression. © 2014 .},

	abstract = {To predict community-level responses to climate change, we must understand how variation in environmental conditions drives changes in an organism's ability to acquire resources and translate those resources into growth, reproduction, and survival. This challenge can be approached mechanistically by establishing linkages from biophysics to community ecology. For example, body temperature can be predicted from environmental conditions and species-specific morphological and behavioral traits. Variation in body temperature within and among species dictates physiological performance, rates of resource acquisition, and growth. These ecological characteristics, along with population size, define the strength with which species interact. Finally, the direct (individual level) and indirect (community level) effects of temperature jointly determine community structure. This mechanistic framework can complement correlational approaches to better predict ecological responses to climate change and identify which characteristics of a species or community act as leverage points for change. Research priorities for further development of the mechanistic approach include documentation and prediction of relevant spatial and temporal variation in body temperature and the relationships between body temperature, individual performance, and interspecific interactions. © 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {We studied the impact of simulated global change on a high alpine meadow plant community. Specifically, we examined whether short-term (5 years) responses are good predictors for medium-term (7 years) changes in the system by applying a factorial warming and nutrient manipulation to 20 plots in Latnjajaure, subarctic Sweden. Seven years of experimental warming and nutrient enhancement caused dramatic shifts in dominance hierarchies in response to the nutrient and the combined warming and nutrient enhancement treatments. Dominance hierarchies in the meadow moved from a community being dominated by cushion plants, deciduous, and evergreen shrubs to a community being dominated by grasses, sedges, and forbs. Short-termresponses were shown to be inconsistent in their ability to predict medium-term responses for most functional groups, however, grasses showed a consistent and very substantial increase in response to nutrient addition over the seven years. The non-linear responses over time point out the importance of longer-term studies with repeated measurements to be able to better predict future changes. Forecasted changes to temperature and nutrient availability have implications for trophic interactions, and may ultimately influence the access to and palatability of the forage for grazers. Depending on what anthropogenic change will be most pronounced in the future (increase in nutrient deposits, warming, or a combination of them both), different shifts in community dominance hierarchies may occur. Generally, this study supports the productivity-diversity relationship found across arctic habitats, with community diversity peaking in mid-productivity systems and degrading as nutrient availability increases further. This is likely due the increasing competition in plant-plant interactions and the shifting dominance structure with grasses taking over the experimental plots, suggesting that global change could have high costs to biodiversity in the Arctic. © 2014 Alatalo et al.},

	abstract = {Progress in understanding the mechanisms of adaptive plant abiotic stress response has historically come from two separate fields. Molecular biologists employ mutagenic screens, experimental manipulations, and controlled stress treatment to identify genes that, when perturbed, have fairly large effects on phenotype. By contrast, quantitative and evolutionary geneticists generally study naturally occurring variants to inform multigenic models of trait architecture in an effort to predict, for example, the evolutionary response to selection. We discuss five emerging themes from the molecular study of osmotic stress response: the multigenic nature of adaptive response, the modular organization of response to specific cues, the pleiotropic effects of key signaling proteins, the integration of many environmental signals, and the abundant cross-talk between signaling pathways. We argue that these concepts can be incorporated into existing models of trait evolution and provide examples of what may constitute the molecular basis of plasticity and evolvability of abiotic stress response. We conclude by considering future directions in the study of the functional molecular evolution of abiotic stress response that may facilitate new discoveries in molecular biology, evolutionary studies, and plant breeding. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Wild populations of endangered Hawaiian tree snails have declined precipitously over the last century due to introduced predators and other human impacts. Life history traits, such as very low fecundity (<5 offspring per year across taxa) and maturity at approximately four years of age have made recovery difficult. Conservation efforts such as in situ predator-free enclosures may increase survival to maturity by protecting offspring from predation, but no long-term data existed prior to this study demonstrating the demographic and genetic parameters necessary to maintain populations within those enclosures. We evaluated over 20 years of evidence for the dynamics of survival and extinction in captive ex situ populations of Hawaiian tree snails established from wild-collected individuals. From 1991 to 2006, small numbers of snails (<15) from fifteen species were collected from the wild to initiate captive-reared populations as a hedge against extinction. This small number of founders resulted in a severe bottleneck in each of the captive-reared populations.We identified key demographic parameters that predicted population recovery from this bottleneck. Species with captive populations that produced between two and four offspring per adult per year and had 20-50% of those offspring survive to maturity recovered to numbers above 100 individuals, and maintained viable populations following a decline that occurred between 2009 and 2014. Those populations that had less than two offspring per adult per year and less than 20% survival to maturity did not reach 100 individuals in captivity, and many of these populations died out during the recent decline. We suggest that small reductions in fitness may contribute to extirpation in taxa with inherently low fecundity, by keeping populations below a threshold number essential to long-term recovery. Future ex situ populations should be founded with no less than 15 adults, and maintained in conditions closely approximating the temperature and humidity of source locations to optimize fitness. Permanent translocations of wild populations for conservation purposes will be more likely to succeed with greater than 100 adults, and should be limited to locations with a similar climate to source locations. © 2015 Price et al.},

	abstract = {Background. Mexico has the world's fifth largest population of amphibians and the second country with the highest quantity of threatened amphibian species. About 10% ofMexican amphibians lack enough data to be assigned to a risk category by the IUCN, so in this paper we want to test a statistical tool that, in the absence of specific demographic data, can assess a species' risk of extinction, population trend, and to better understand which variables increase their vulnerability. Recent studies have demonstrated that the risk of species decline depends on extrinsic and intrinsic traits, thus including both of them for assessing extinction might render more accurate assessment of threats. Methods.We harvested data fromthe Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and the published literature for Mexican amphibians, and used these data to assess the population trend of some of theMexican species that have been assigned to the Data Deficient category of the IUCN using RandomForests, aMachine Learning method that gives a prediction of complex processes and identifies the most important variables that account for the predictions. Results. Our results show that most of the data deficient Mexican amphibians that we used have decreasing population trends.We found that RandomForests is a solid way to identify species with decreasing population trends when no demographic data is available. Moreover, we point to the most important variables that make species more vulnerable for extinction. This exercise is a very valuable first step in assigning conservation priorities for poorly known species. © 2014 Quintero et al.},
